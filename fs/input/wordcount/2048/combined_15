 dumbledore reckons getting stronger again as well ron whispered 
 
 everything harry had seen in the pensieve nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward he had now shared with ron and hermione and of course with sirius to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left office harry ron and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night talking it all over until mind was reeling until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off 
 
 ron stared into the common room fire harry thought he saw ron shiver slightly even though the evening was warm 
 
 and he trusts snape ron said he really trusts snape even though he knows he was a death eater 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 hermione had not spoken for ten minutes she was sitting with her forehead in her hands staring at her knees harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a pensieve 
 
 rita skeeter she muttered finally 
 
 how can you be worrying about her now said ron in utter disbelief 
 
 not worrying about her hermione said to her knees just thinkingremember what she said to me in the three broomsticks i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl this is what she meant it she reported his trial she knew passed information to the death eaters and winky too a bad wizard mr crouch would have been furious he got off he would have talked about it at home 
 
 yeah but bagman pass information on purpose did he 
 
 hermione shrugged 
 
 and fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch ron said turning back to harry 
 
 yeah said harry but only saying that because crouch disappeared near the beauxbatons carriage 
 
 we never thought of her did we said ron slowly mind you definitely got giant blood and she want to admit it 
 
 of course she said hermione sharply looking up look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother look at fudge jumping to conclusions about her just because part giant who needs that sort of prejudice probably say i had big bones if i knew what get for telling the truth 
 
 hermione looked at her watch we done any practicing she said looking shocked we were going to do the impediment curse have to really get down to it tomorrow come on harry you need to get some sleep 
 
 harry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory as harry pulled on his pajamas he looked over at bed true to his word to dumbledore he had not told ron and hermione about parents as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan but as he listened to snores he thought that neville deserved it more than he did lying in the darkness harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr and mrs remembered the jeers of the crowd as son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the understood how they had he remembered the face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later 
 
 it was voldemort harry thought staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness it all came back to was the one who had torn these families apart who had ruined all these lives 
 
 ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams which would finish on the day of the third task but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry prepare 
 
 worry about it hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he mind practicing on his own for a while at least get top marks in defense against the dark arts never have found out about all these hexes in class 
 
 good training for when all aurors said ron excitedly attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair 
 
 the mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again everyone was looking forward to the third task which would take place a week before the end of term harry was practicing hexes at every available moment he felt more confident about this task than either of the others difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be moody was right harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now and this time he had some notice some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead 
 
 tired of walking in on harry hermione and ron all over the school professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes harry had soon mastered the impediment curse a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers the reductor curse which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way and the spell a useful discovery of that would make his wand point due north therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze he was still having trouble with the shield charm though this was supposed to cast a temporary invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses hermione managed to shatter it with a jinx and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the 
 
 still doing really well though hermione said encouragingly looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned some of these are bound to come in handy 
 
 come and look at this said ron who was standing by the window he was staring down onto the grounds malfoy doing 
 
 harry and hermione went to see malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout both were smirking malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it 
 
 he looks like using a said harry curiously 
 
 he be said hermione told you those sorts of things work around hogwarts come on harry she added briskly turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room try that shield charm again 
 
 sirius was sending daily owls now like hermione he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not responsibility nor was it within his power to influence it 
 
 if voldemort is really getting stronger again he wrote my priority is to ensure your safety he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under protection but all the same take no risks concentrate on getting through that maze safely and then we can turn our attention to other matters 
 nerves mounted as june the drew closer but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks for one thing he was confident that this time he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task for another this was the final hurdle and however well or badly he did the tournament would at last be over which would be an enormous relief 
 
 
 
 breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task the post owls appeared bringing harry a card from sirius it was only a piece of parchment folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front but harry appreciated it all the same a screech owl arrived for hermione carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual she unfolded the paper glanced at the front page and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it 
 
 what said harry and ron together staring at her nothing said hermione quickly trying to shove the paper out of sight but ron grabbed it he stared at the headline and said no way not today that old cow 
 
 what said harry rita skeeter again 
 
 no said ron and just like hermione he attempted to push the paper out of sight 
 
 about me it said harry 
 
 no said ron in an entirely unconvincing tone but before harry could demand to see the paper draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table 
 
 hey potter potter your head you feeling all right sure not going to go berserk on us 
 
 malfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too slytherins up and down the table were sniggering twisting in their seats to see reaction 
 
 let me see it harry said to ron give it here 
 
 very reluctantly ron handed over the newspaper harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture beneath the banner headline 
 
 harry potter 
 disturbed and dangerous 
 the boy who defeated is unstable and possibly dangerous writes rita skeeter special correspondent alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry strange behavior which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament or even to attend hogwarts school 
 potter the daily prophet can exclusively reveal regularly collapses at school and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead relic of the curse with which attempted to kill him on monday last midway through a divination lesson your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying 
 it is possible say top experts at st hospital for magical maladies and injuries that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his confusion 
 he might even be pretending said one specialist this could be a plea for attention 
 the daily prophet however has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts has carefully concealed from the wizarding public 
 potter can speak parseltongue reveals draco malfoy a hogwarts fourth year there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy it was all hushed up though but made friends with werewolves and giants too we think do anything for a bit of power 
 parseltongue the ability to converse with snakes has long been considered a dark art indeed the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than himself a member of the dark force defense league who wished to remain unnamed stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue as worthy of investigation personally i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic and are historically associated with evildoers similarly anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence 
 albus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard tournament some fear that potter might resort to the dark arts in his desperation to win the tournament the third task of which takes place this evening 
 gone off me a bit she said harry lightly folding up the paper 
 
 over at the slytherin table malfoy crabbe and goyle were laughing at him tapping their heads with their fingers pulling grotesquely mad faces and waggling their tongues like snakes 
 
 how did she know your scar hurt in divination ron said no way she was there no way she heard 
 
 the window was open said harry i opened it to breathe 
 
 you were at the top of north tower hermione said your voice have carried all the way down to the grounds 
 
 well the one supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging said harry you tell me how she did it 
 
 been trying said hermione but ibut 
 
 an odd dreamy expression suddenly came over face she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair 
 
 are you all right said ron frowning at her 
 
 yes said hermione breathlessly she ran her fingers through her hair again and then held her hand up to her mouth as though speaking into an invisible harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 had an idea hermione said gazing into space i think i knowbecause then no one would be able to seeeven moodyand have been able to get onto the window ledgebut not definitely not allowedi think got her just give me two seconds in the library just to make sure 
 
 with that hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the great hall 
 
 oi ron called after her got our history of magic exam in ten minutes blimey he said turning back to harry she must really hate that skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam you going to do in class read again 
 
 exempt from the tests as a triwizard champion harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far looking up fresh hexes for the third task 
 
 so harry said to ron but just then professor mcgonagall came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him 
 
 potter the champions are congregating in the chamber off the hall after breakfast she said 
 
 but the not till tonight said harry accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front afraid he had mistaken the time 
 
 aware of that potter she said the champions families are invited to watch the final task you know this is simply a chance for you to greet them 
 
 she moved away harry gaped after her 
 
 she expect the dursleys to turn up does she he asked ron blankly 
 
 dunno said ron harry better hurry going to be late for binns see you later 
 
 harry finished his breakfast in the emptying great hall he saw fleur delacour get up from the ravenclaw table and join cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward harry stayed where he was he really want to go into the chamber he had no family no family who would turn up to see him risk his life anyway but just as he was getting up thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research the door of the side chamber opened and cedric stuck his head out 
 
 harry come on waiting for you 
 
 utterly perplexed harry got up the dursleys possibly be here could they he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chamber 
 
 cedric and his parents were just inside the door viktor krum was over in a corner conversing with his mother and father in rapid bulgarian he had inherited his fathers hooked nose on the other side of the room fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother little sister gabrielle was holding her hand she waved at harry who waved back grinning then he saw mrs weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace beaming at him 
 
 surprise mrs weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them thought come and watch you harry she bent down and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 you all right said bill grinning at harry and shaking his hand charlie wanted to come but he get time off he said you were incredible against the horntail 
 
 fleur delacour harry noticed was eyeing bill with great interest over her shoulder harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them 
 
 this is really nice of you harry muttered to mrs weasley i thought for a moment the dursleys 
 
 hmm said mrs weasley pursing her lips she had always refrained from criticizing the dursleys in front of harry but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned 
 
 great being back here said bill looking around the chamber violet the fat friend winked at him from her frame seen this place for five years is that picture of the mad knight still around sir cadogan 
 
 oh yeah said harry who had met sir cadogan the previous year 
 
 and the fat lady said bill 
 
 she was here in my time said mrs weasley she gave me such a telling off one night when i got back to the dormitory at four in the morning 
 
 what were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning said bill surveying his mother with amazement 
 
 mrs weasley grinned her eyes twinkling 
 
 your father and i had been for a nighttime stroll she said he got caught by apollyon pringle he was the caretaker in those days your still got the marks 
 
 fancy giving us a tour harry said bill 
 
 yeah okay said harry and they made their way back toward the door into the great hall as they passed amos diggory he looked around 
 
 there you are are you he said looking harry up and down 
 
 bet not feeling quite as full of yourself now caught you up on points are you 
 
 what said harry 
 
 ignore him said cedric in a low voice to harry frowning after his father been angry ever since rita article about the triwizard tournament you know when she made out you were the only hogwarts champion 
 
 bother to correct her though did he said amos diggory loudly enough for harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with mrs weasley and bill show him ced beaten him once before you 
 
 rita skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble amos mrs weasley said angrily i would have thought know that working at the ministry 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry but his wife laid a hand on his arm and he merely shrugged and turned away 
 
 harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with bill and mrs weasley showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship mrs weasley was intrigued by the whomping willow which had been planted after she had left school and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before hagrid a man called ogg 
 
 percy harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses 
 
 not good said bill 
 
 very upset said mrs weasley lowering her voice and glancing around the ministry wants to keep mr disappearance quiet but been hauled in for questioning about the instructions mr crouch has been sending in they seem to think a chance they genuinely written by him been under a lot of strain not letting him fill in for mr crouch as the fifth judge tonight cornelius fudge is going to be doing it 
 
 they returned to the castle for lunch 
 
 mum bill said ron looking stunned as he joined the gryffindor table you doing here 
 
 come to watch harry in the last task said mrs weasley brightly i must say it makes a lovely change not having to cook how was your exam 
 
 ohokay said ron remember all the goblin rebels names so i invented a few all right he said helping himself to a cornish pasty while mrs weasley looked stern all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it hard 
 
 fred george and ginny came to sit next to them too and harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the burrow he had forgotten to worry about that task and not until hermione turned up halfway through lunch did he remember that she had had a brainwave about rita skeeter 
 
 are you going to tell us 
 
 hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at mrs weasley 
 
 hello hermione said mrs weasley much more stiffly than usual 
 
 hello said hermione her smile faltering at the cold expression on mrs face 
 
 harry looked between them then said mrs weasley you believe that rubbish rita skeeter wrote in witch weekly did you because not my girlfriend 
 
 oh said mrs weasley no of course i 
 
 but she became considerably warmer toward hermione after that 
 
 harry bill and mrs weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now bagman looked quite cheerful but cornelius fudge who was sitting next to madame maxime looked stern and was not talking madame maxime was concentrating on her plate and harry thought her eyes looked red hagrid kept glancing along the table at her 
 
 there were more courses than usual but harry who was starting to feel really nervous now eat much as the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table and silence fell 
 
 ladies and gentlemen in five minutes time i will be asking you to make your way down to the quidditch field for the third and final task of the triwizard tournament will the champions please follow mr bagman down to the stadium now 
 
 harry got up the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric fleur and viktor 
 
 feeling all right harry bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds confident 
 
 okay said harry it was sort of true he was nervous but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better 
 
 they walked onto the quidditch field which was now completely unrecognizable a hedge ran all the way around the edge of it there was a gap right in front of them the entrance to the vast maze the passage beyond it looked dark and creepy 
 
 five minutes later the stands had begun to fill the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats the sky was a deep clear blue now and the first stars were starting to appear hagrid professor moody professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached bagman and the champions they were wearing large red luminous stars on their hats all except hagrid who had his on the back of his moleskin vest 
 
 we are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze said professor mcgonagall to the champions if you get into difficulty and wish to be rescued send red sparks into the air and one of us will come and get you do you understand 
 
 the champions nodded 
 
 off you go then said bagman brightly to the four patrollers 
 
 good luck harry hagrid whispered and the four of them walked away in different directions to station themselves around the maze bagman now pointed his wand at his throat muttered sonorus and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemen the third and final task of the triwizard tournament is about to begin let me remind you how the points currently stand tied in first place with points each mr cedric diggory and mr harry potter both of hogwarts school the cheers and applause sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into the darkening sky in second place with eighty points mr viktor krum of durmstrang institute more applause and in third place miss fleur delacour of beauxbatons academy 
 
 harry could just make out mrs weasley bill ron and hermione applauding fleur politely halfway up the stands he waved up at them and they waved back beaming at him 
 
 soon my whistle harry and cedric said bagman three two one 
 
 he gave a short blast on his whistle and harry and cedric hurried forward into the maze 
 
 the towering hedges cast black shadows across the path and whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze harry felt almost as though he were underwater again he pulled out his wand muttered lumos and heard cedric do the same just behind him 
 
 after about fifty yards they reached a fork they looked at each other 
 
 see you harry said and he took the left one while cedric took the right 
 
 harry heard whistle for the second time krum had entered the maze harry sped up his chosen path seemed completely deserted he turned right and hurried on holding his wand high over his head trying to see as far ahead as possible still there was nothing in sight 
 
 whistle blew in the distance for the third time all of the champions were now inside 
 
 harry kept looking behind him the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy he reached a second fork 
 
 point me he whispered to his wand holding it flat in his palm 
 
 the wand spun around once and pointed toward his right into solid hedge that way was north and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze the best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible 
 
 the path ahead was empty too and when harry reached a right turn and took it he again found his way unblocked harry know why but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him surely he should have met something by now it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security then he heard movement right behind him he held out his wand ready to attack but its beam fell only upon cedric who had just hurried out of a path on the side cedric looked severely shaken the sleeve of his robe was smoking 
 
 skrewts he hissed enormous i only just got away 
 
 he shook his head and dived out of sight along another path keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts harry hurried off again then as he turned a corner he sawa dementor gliding toward him twelve feet tall its face hidden by its hood its rotting scabbed hands outstretched it advanced sensing its way blindly toward him harry could hear its rattling breath he felt clammy coldness stealing over him but knew what he had to do 
 
 he summoned the happiest thought he could concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and hermione raised his wand and cried expecto patronum 
 
 a silver stag erupted from the end of wand and galloped toward the dementor which fell back and tripped over the hem of its had never seen a dementor stumble 
 
 hang on he shouted advancing in the wake of his silver patronus a boggart riddikulus 
 
 there was a loud crack and the exploded in a wisp of smoke the silver stag faded from sight harry wished it could have stayed he could have used some companybut he moved on quickly and quietly as possible listening hard his wand held high once more 
 
 leftrightleft againtwice he found himself facing dead ends he did the spell again and found that he was going too far east he turned back took a right turn and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him 
 
 harry approached it cautiously pointing the beam at it this looked like some kind of enchantment he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way 
 
 reducio he said 
 
 the spell shot straight through the mist leaving it intact he supposed he should have known better the reductor curse was for solid objects what would happen if he walked through the mist was it worth chancing it or should he double back 
 
 he was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence 
 
 fleur harry yelled 
 
 there was silence he stared all around him what had happened to her her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead he took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist 
 
 the world turned upside down harry was hanging from the ground with his hair on end his glasses dangling off his nose threatening to fall into the bottomless sky he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there terrified it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass which had now become the ceiling below him the dark heavens stretched endlessly he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet he would fall away from the earth completely 
 
 think he told himself as all the blood rushed to his head think 
 
 but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky did he dare move his foot he could hear the blood pounding in his ears he had two choices try and move or send up red sparks and get rescued and disqualified from the task 
 
 he shut his eyes so he be able to see the view of endless space below him and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling 
 
 immediately the world righted itself harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground he felt temporarily limp with shock he took a deep steadying breath then got up again and hurried forward looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight 
 
 he paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of fleur he was sure it had been she who had screamed what had she met was she all right there was no sign of red sparks did that mean she had got herself out of trouble or was she in such trouble that she reach her wand harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing uneasebut at the same time he help thinking one champion down 
 
 the cup was somewhere close by and it sounded as though fleur was no longer in the running got this far he what if he actually managed to win fleetingly and for the first time since found himself champion he saw again that image of himself raising the triwizard cup in front of the rest of the school 
 
 he met nothing for ten minutes but kept running into dead ends twice he took the same wrong turning finally he found a new route and started to jog along it his wandlight waving making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a skrewt 
 
 cedric was right it was enormous ten feet long it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything its long sting was curled over its back its thick armor glinted in the light from wand which he pointed at it 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the spell hit the armor and rebounded harry ducked just in time but could smell burning hair it had singed the top of his head the skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him 
 
 impedimenta harry yelled the spell hit the armor again and ricocheted off harry staggered back a few paces and fell over impedimenta 
 
 the skrewt was inches from him when it froze he had managed to hit it on its fleshy underside panting harry pushed himself away from it and ran hard in the opposite direction the impediment curse was not permanent the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment 
 
 he took a left path and hit a dead end a right and hit another forcing himself to stop heart hammering he performed the spell again backtracked and chose a path that would take him northwest 
 
 he had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead 
 
 what are you doing yelled voice what the hell think doing 
 
 and then harry heard voice 
 
 crucio 
 
 the air was suddenly full of yells horrified harry began sprinting up his path trying to find a way into when none appeared he tried the reductor curse again it very effective but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it tearing his robes and looking to his right saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground krum standing over him 
 
 harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at krum just as krum looked up krum turned and began to run 
 
 stupefy harry yelled 
 
 the spell hit krum in the back he stopped dead in his tracks fell forward and lay motionless facedown in the grass over to cedric who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting his hands over his face 
 
 are you all right harry said roughly grabbing arm 
 
 yeah panted cedric yeahi believe ithe crept up behind heard him i turned around and he had his wand on me 
 
 cedric got up he was still shaking he and harry looked down at krum 
 
 i believe thisi thought he was all right harry said staring at krum 
 
 so did i said cedric 
 
 did you hear fleur scream earlier said harry 
 
 yeah said cedric you think krum got her too 
 
 i know said harry slowly 
 
 should we leave him here cedric muttered 
 
 no said harry i reckon we should send up red sparks come and collect himotherwise probably be eaten by a skrewt 
 
 deserve it cedric muttered but all the same he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air which hovered high above krum marking the spot where he lay 
 
 harry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment looking around them then cedric said welli better go on 
 
 what said harry ohyeahright 
 
 it was an odd moment he and cedric had been briefly united against krum now the fact that they were opponents came back to harry the two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking then harry turned left and cedric right footsteps soon died away 
 
 harry moved on continuing to use the spell making sure he was moving in the right direction it was between him and cedric now his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever but he could hardly believe what just seen krum do the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban that was what moody had told them krum surely have wanted the triwizard cup that sped up 
 
 every so often he hit more dead ends but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze then as he strode down a long straight path he saw movement once again and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature one which he had only seen in picture form in his monster book of monsters 
 
 it was a sphinx it had the body of an lion great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft its head however was that of a woman she turned her long eyes upon harry as he approached he raised his wand hesitating she was not crouching as if to spring but pacing from side to side of the path blocking his progress then she spoke in a deep hoarse voice 
 
 you are very near your goal the quickest way is past me 
 
 soso will you move please said harry knowing what the answer was going to be 
 
 no she said continuing to pace not unless you can answer my riddle answer on your first guess i let you pass answer wrongly i attack remain silent i will let you walk away from me unscathed 
 
 stomach slipped several notches it was hermione who was good at this sort of thing not him he weighed his chances if the riddle was too hard he could keep silent get away from the sphinx unharmed and try and find an alternative route to the center 
 
 okay he said can i hear the riddle 
 
 the sphinx sat down upon her hind legs in the very middle of the path and recited 
 
 first think of the person who lives in disguise 
 who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies 
 next tell me always the last thing to mend 
 the middle of middle and end of the end 
 and finally give me the sound often heard 
 during the search for a word 
 now string them together and answer me this 
 which creature would you be unwilling to kiss 
 
 harry gaped at her 
 
 could i have it againmore slowly he asked tentatively she blinked at him smiled and repeated the poem all the clues add up to a creature i want to kiss harry asked 
 
 she merely smiled her mysterious smile harry took that for a yes harry cast his mind around there were plenty of animals he want to kiss his immediate thought was a skrewt but something told him that the answer have to try and work out the clues 
 
 a person in disguise harry muttered staring at her who be a an impostor no not my guess a a spy come back to thatcould you give me the next clue again please 
 
 she repeated the next lines of the poem 
 
 the last thing to mend harry repeated erno of i have the last bit again 
 
 she gave him the last four lines 
 
 the sound often heard during the search for a word said harry beerhang on er a sound 
 
 the sphinx smiled at him 
 
 spyerspyer said harry pacing up and down a creature i want to kissa spider 
 
 the sphinx smiled more broadly she got up stretched her front legs and then moved aside for him to pass 
 
 thanks said harry and amazed at his own brilliance he dashed forward 
 
 he had to be close now he had to wand was telling him he was bang on course as long as he meet anything too horrible he might have a chance 
 
 harry broke into a run he had a choice of paths up ahead point me he whispered again to his wand and it spun around and pointed him to the one he dashed up this one and saw light ahead 
 
 the triwizard cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him 
 
 cedric was going to get there first cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup and harry knew he would never catch up cedric was much taller had much longer legs 
 
 then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own it was moving so fast cedric was about to run into it and cedric his eyes on the cup had not seen it 
 
 cedric harry bellowed on your left 
 
 cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it but in his haste he tripped harry saw wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon cedric 
 
 stupefy harry yelled the spell hit the gigantic hairy black body but for all the good it did he might as well have thrown a stone at it the spider jerked scuttled around and ran at harry instead 
 
 stupefy impedimenta stupefy 
 
 but it was no use the spider was either so large or so magical that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and pincers before it was upon him 
 
 he was lifted into the air in its front legs struggling madly he tried to kick it his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain he could hear cedric yelling stupefy too but his spell had no more effect than harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmus 
 
 it worked the disarming spell made the spider drop him but that meant that harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg which crumpled beneath him without pausing to think he aimed high at the underbelly as he had done with the skrewt and shouted as cedric yelled the same thing 
 
 the two spells combined did what one alone had not the spider keeled over sideways flattening a nearby hedge and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs 
 
 harry he heard cedric shouting you all right did it fall on you 
 
 no harry called back panting he looked down at his leg it was bleeding freely he could see some sort of thick gluey secretion from the pincers on his torn robes he tried to get up but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight he leaned against the hedge gasping for breath and looked around 
 
 cedric was standing feet from the triwizard cup which was gleaming behind him 
 
 take it then harry panted to cedric go on take it there 
 
 but cedric move he merely stood there looking at harry then he turned to stare at the cup harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light cedric looked around at harry again who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself cedric took a deep breath 
 
 you take it you should win twice saved my neck in here 
 
 not how supposed to work harry said he felt angry his leg was very painful he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider and after all his efforts cedric had beaten him to it just as beaten harry to ask cho to the ball the one who reaches the cup first gets the points you telling you not going to win any races on this leg 
 
 cedric took a few paces nearer to the stunned spider away from the cup shaking his head 
 
 no he said 
 
 stop being noble said harry irritably just take it then we can get out of here 
 
 cedric watched harry steadying himself holding tight to the hedge 
 
 you told me about the dragons cedric said i gone down in the first task if you told me what was coming 
 
 i had help on that too harry snapped trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes you helped me with the egg square 
 
 i had help on the egg in the first place said cedric 
 
 still square said harry testing his leg gingerly it shook violently as he put weight on it he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him 
 
 you got more points on the second task said cedric mulishly you stayed behind to get all the hostages i done that 
 
 i was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously said harry bitterly just take the cup 
 
 no said cedric 
 
 he stepped over the tangled legs to join harry who stared at him cedric was serious he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house had in centuries 
 
 go on cedric said he looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had but his face was set his arms were folded he seemed decided 
 
 harry looked from cedric to the cup for one shining moment he saw himself emerging from the maze holding it he saw himself holding the triwizard cup aloft heard the roar of the crowd saw face shining with admiration more clearly than he had ever seen it beforeand then the picture faded and he found himself staring at shadowy stubborn face 
 
 both of us harry said 
 
 what 
 
 take it at the same time still a hogwarts victory tie for it 
 
 cedric stared at harry he unfolded his arms 
 
 you you sure 
 
 yeah said harry helped each other out we we both got here just take it together 
 
 for a moment cedric looked as though he believe his ears then his face split in a grin 
 
 on he said come here 
 
 he grabbed arm below the shoulder and helped harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood when they had reached it they both held a hand out over one of the gleaming handles 
 
 on three right said harry one two three 
 
 he and cedric both grasped a handle 
 
 instantly harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel his feet had left the ground he could not unclench the hand holding the triwizard cup it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color cedric at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 euphoria at helping gryffindor scrape the quidditch cup was such that he settle to anything next day all he wanted to do was talk over the match so harry and hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention grawp not that either of them tried very hard neither was keen to be the one to bring ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion as it was another fine warm day they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room ron was not particularly keen on this idea at firsthe was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every gryffindor who walked past his chair not to mention the occasional outbursts of weasley is our after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good 
 
 they spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time 
 
 well i mean already let in that one of so i feeling all that confident but i dunno when bradley came towards me just out of nowhere i thoughtyou can do this and i had about a second to decide which way to fly you know because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop my right obviously his leftbut i had a funny feeling that he was feinting and so i took the chance and flew lefthis right i meanandwellyou saw what happened he concluded modestly sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to thema bunch of gossiping hufflepuffshad heard him and then when chambers came at me about five minutes laterwhat ron asked having stopped at the look on face why are you grinning 
 
 not said harry quickly and looked down at his transfiguration notes attempting to straighten his lace the truth was that ron had just reminded harry forcibly of another gryffindor quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree just glad we won all 
 
 yeah said ron slowly savouring the words we you see the look on face when ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose 
 
 i suppose she cried did she said harry bitterly 
 
 well yeah more out of temper than anything though ron frowned slightly but you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground you 
 
 er said harry 
 
 well actually no ron said hermione with a heavy sigh putting down her book and looking at him apologetically as a matter of fact the only bit of the match harry and i saw was first goal 
 
 carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment you watch he said faintly looking from one to the other you see me make any of those saves 
 
 wellno said hermione stretching out a placatory hand towards him but ron we want to leavewe had to 
 
 yeah said ron whose face was growing rather red how come 
 
 it was hagrid said harry he decided to tell us why been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants he wanted us to go into the forest with him we had no choice you know how he gets anyway 
 
 the story was told in five minutes by the end of which indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity 
 
 he brought one back and hid it in the forest 
 
 yep said harry grimly 
 
 no said ron as though by saying this he could make it untrue no he have 
 
 well he has said hermione firmly about sixteen feet tall enjoys ripping up pine trees and knows me she snorted as hermy 
 
 ron gave a nervous laugh 
 
 and hagrid wants us to 
 
 teach him english yeah said harry 
 
 lost his mind said ron in an almost awed voice 
 
 yes said hermione irritably turning a page of intermediate transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses yes starting to think he has but unfortunately he made harry and me promise 
 
 well just going to have to break your promise all said ron firmly i mean come on got exams and about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching from being chucked out as it is and anyway remember norbert remember aragog have we ever come off better for mixing with any of monster mates 
 
 i know just thatwe promised said hermione in a small voice 
 
 ron smoothed his hair flat again looking preoccupied 
 
 well he sighed hagrid been sacked yet has he hung on this long maybe hang on till the end of term and we have to go near grawp at all 
 
 the castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze june had arrived but to the this meant only one thing their owls were upon them at last 
 
 their teachers were no longer setting them homework lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams the purposeful feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the owls from mind though he did wonder occasionally during potions lessons whether lupin had ever told snape that he must continue giving harry ooclumency tuition if he had then snape had ignored lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring harry this suited harry very well he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with snape and to his relief hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about occlumency she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days 
 
 she was not the only person acting oddly as the owls drew steadily nearer ernie macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices 
 
 how many hours think doing a day he demanded of harry and ron as they queued outside herbology a manic gleam in his eyes 
 
 i dunno said ron a few 
 
 more or less than eight 
 
 less i said ron looking slightly alarmed 
 
 doing eight said ernie puffing out his chest eight or nine getting an hour in before breakfast every day eights my average i can do ten on a good weekend day i did nine and a half on monday not so good on tuesdayonly seven and a quarter then on wednesday 
 
 harry was deeply thankful that professor sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point forcing ernie to abandon his recital 
 
 meanwhile draco malfoy had found a different way to induce panic 
 
 of course not what you know he was heard to tell crabbe and goyle loudly outside potions a few days before the exams were to start who you know now been friendly with the head of the wizarding examinations authority for yearsold griselda had her round for dinner and everthing 
 
 do you think true hermione whispered in alarm to harry and ron 
 
 nothing we can do about it if it is said ron gloomily 
 
 i think true said neville quietly from behind them because griselda marchbanks is a friend of my and never mentioned the 
 
 she like neville asked hermione at once is she strict 
 
 bit like gran really said neville in a subdued voice 
 
 knowing her hurt your chances though will it ron told him encouragingly 
 
 oh i think it will make any difference said neville still more miserably always telling professor marchbanks not as good as my dad well you saw what like at st 
 
 neville looked fixedly at the floor harry ron and hermione glanced at each other but know what to say it was the first time neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital 
 
 meanwhile a flourishing trade in aids to concentration mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and harry and ron were much tempted by the bottle of brain elixir offered to them by ravenclaw eddie carmichael who swore it was solely responsible for the nine outstanding owls he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve galleons ron assured harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left hogwarts and got a job but before they could close the deal hermione had confiscated the bottle from carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet 
 
 hermione we wanted to buy that shouted ron 
 
 be stupid she snarled you might as well take harold powdered dragon claw and have done with it 
 
 got powdered dragon claw said ron eagerly 
 
 not any more said hermione i confiscated that too none of these things actually work you know 
 
 dragon claw does work said ron supposed to be incredible really gives your brain a boost you come over all cunning for a few hourshermione let me have a pinch go on it hurt 
 
 this stuff can said hermione grimly had a look at it and actually dried doxy droppings 
 
 this information took the edge off harry and desire for brain stimulants 
 
 they received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for owls during their next transfiguration lesson 
 
 as you can see professor mcgonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard your owls are spread over two successive weeks you will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons your practical astronomy examination will of course take place at night 
 
 now i must warn you that the most stringent charms have been applied to your examination papers quills are banned from the examination hall as are remembralls detachable cribbing cuffs and ink every year i am afraid to say seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the wizarding examinations rules i can only hope that it is nobody in gryffindor our newheadmistress professor mcgonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that aunt petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt has asked the heads of house to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severelybecause of course your examination results will reflect upon the new regime at the school 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave a tiny sigh harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare 
 
 however that is no reason not to do your very best you have your own futures to think about 
 
 please professor said hermione her hand in the air when will we find out our results 
 
 an owl will be sent to you some time in july said professcr mcgonagall 
 
 excellent said dean thomas in an audible whisper so we have to worry about it till the holidays 
 
 harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in privet drive in six weeks time waiting for his owl results well he thought dully at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer 
 
 their first examination theory of charms was scheduled for monday morning harry agreed to test hermione after lunch on sunday but regretted it almost at once she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of achievements in charming 
 
 why you just do it yourself he said firmly handing the book back to her his eyes watering 
 
 meanwhile ron was reading two years worth of charms notes with his fingers in his ears his lips moving soundlessly seamus finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a substantive charm while dean checked it against the standard book of spells grade and parvati and lavender who were practising basic locomotion charms were making their race each other around the edge of the table 
 
 dinner was a subdued affair that night harry and ron did not talk much but ate with gusto having studied hard all day hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate 
 
 oh my goodness she said faintly staring into the entrance hall is that them is that the examiners 
 
 harry and ron whipped around on their bench through the doors to the great hall they could see umbridge standing with a small group of witches and wizards umbridge harry was pleased to see looked rather nervous 
 
 shall we go and have a closer look said ron 
 
 harry and hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the entrance hall slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners harry thought professor marchbanks must be the tiny stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs umbridge was speaking to her deferentially professor marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf she was answering professor umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart 
 
 journey was fine journey was fine made it plenty of times before she said impatiently now i heard from dumbledore lately she added peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard no idea where he is i suppose 
 
 none at all said umbridge shooting a malevolent look at harry ron and hermione who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as ron pretended to do up his shoelace but i daresay the ministry of magic will track him down soon enough 
 
 i doubt it shouted tiny professor marchbanks not it dumbledore want to be found i should know examined him personally in transfiguration and charms when he did newts did things with a wand never seen before 
 
 yes well said professor umbridge as harry ron and hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared let me show you to the staff room i daresay like a cup of tea after your journey 
 
 it was an uncomfortable sort of an evening everyone was trying to do some revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours he remembered his careers consultation and furious declaration that she would help him become an auror if it was the last thing she did he wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here he knew he was not the only one lying awake but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally one by one they fell asleep 
 
 none of the talked very much at breakfast next day either parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched hermione was rereading achievements in charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred and neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade 
 
 once breakfast was over the fifth and milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons then at half past nine they were called forwards class by class to the great hall which had been rearranged exactly as harry had seen it in the pensieve when his father sirius and snape had been taking their owls the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one all facing the end of the hall where professor mcgonagall stood facing them when they were all seated and quiet she said you may begin and turned over an enormous on the desk beside her on which there were also spare quills ink bottles and rolls of parchment 
 
 harry turned over his paper his heart thumping hardthree rows to his right and four seats ahead hermione was already scribblingand lowered his eyes to the first question a give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make objects fly 
 
 harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write 
 
 well it too bad was it asked hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later still clutching the exam paper not sure i did myself justice on cheering charms i just ran out of time did you put in the for hiccoughs i sure whether i ought to it felt like too muchand on question 
 
 hermione said ron sternly been through this before not going through every exam afterwards bad enough doing them once 
 
 the ate lunch with the rest of the school the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the great hall where they were to wait until called for their practical examination as small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake 
 
 name was called trembling she left the chamber with anthony goldstein gregory goyle and daphne greengrass students who had already been tested did not return afterwards so harry and ron had no idea how hermione had done 
 
 be fine remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our charms tests said ron 
 
 ten minutes later professor flitwick called parkinson pansypatil padmapatil parvatipotter harry 
 
 good luck said ron quietly harry walked into the great hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook 
 
 professor tofty is free potter squeaked professor flitwick who was standing just inside the door he pointed harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner a short distance from professor marchbanks who was halfway through testing draco malfoy 
 
 potter is it said professor tofty consulting his notes and peering over his at harry as he approached the famous potter 
 
 out of the corner of his eye harry distinctly saw malfoy throw a scathing look over at him the malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed harry could not suppress a grin professor tofty smiled back at him encouragingly 
 
 it he said in his quavery old voice no need to be nervous now if i could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me 
 
 on the whole harry thought it went rather well his levitation charm was certainly much better than had been though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for colour change and growth charms so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before harry could rectify his mistake he was glad hermione had not been in the hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards he could tell ron though ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened 
 
 there was no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for transfiguration next day harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories 
 
 he forgot the definition of a switching spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse at least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana whereas poor hannah abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos causing the examination to be halted for ten minute while the birds were captured and carried out of the hall 
 
 they had their herbology exam on wednesday other than a small bite from a fanged geranium harry felt he had done reasonably well and then on thursday defence against the dark arts here for the first time harry felt sure he had passed he had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure during the practical examination in performing all the and defensive spells right in front of umbridge who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall 
 
 oh bravo cried professor tolty who was examining harry again when harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell very good indeed well i think all potter unless 
 
 he leaned forwards a little 
 
 i heard from my dear friend tiberius ogden that you can produce a patronus for a bonus point 
 
 harry raised his wand looked directly at umbridge and imagined her being sacked 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 his silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall all of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist professor tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically 
 
 excellent he said very well potter you may go 
 
 as harry passed umbridge beside the door their eyes met there was a nasty smile playing around her wide slack mouth but he did not care unless he was very much mistaken and he was not planning on telling anybody in case he was he had just achieved an outstanding owl 
 
 on friday harry and ron had a day off while hermione sat her ancient runes exam and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision they stretched and yawned beside the open window through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess harry could see hagrid in the distance teaching a class on the edge of the forest he was trying to guess what creatures they were examininghe thought it must be unicorns because the boys seemed to be standing back a littlewhen the portrait hole opened and hermione clambered in looking thoroughly 
 
 how were the runes said ron yawning and stretching 
 
 i ehwaz said hermione furiously it means partnership not mixed it up with eihwaz 
 
 ah well said ron lazily only one mistake it still get 
 
 oh shut up said hermione angrily it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail and more put another niffler in office i know how they got it through that new door but i just walked past there and umbridge is shrieking her head offby the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg 
 
 good said harry and ron together 
 
 it is not good said hermione hotly she thinks hagrid doing it remember and we do not want hagrid chucked out 
 
 teaching at the moment she blame him said harry gesturing out of the window 
 
 oh so naive sometimes harry you really think umbridge will wait for proof said hermione who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off towards the girls dormitories banging the door behind her 
 
 such a lovely girl said ron very quietly prodding his queen forward to beat up one of knights 
 
 bad mood persisted for most of the weekend though harry and ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of saturday and sunday revising for potions on monday the exam which harry had been looking forward to leastand which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an auror sure enough he found the written paper difficult though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about polyjuice potion he could describe its effects accurately having taken it illegally in his second year 
 
 the afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be with snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions neville who was sitting very near harry also looked happier than harry had ever seen him during a potions class when professor marchbanks said step away from your cauldrons please the examination is over harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had with luck avoided a fail 
 
 only four exams left said parvati patil wearily as they headed back to gryffindor common room 
 
 only said hermione snappishly got arithmancy and probably the toughest subject there is 
 
 nobody was foolish enough to snap back so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some for giggling too loudly in the common room 
 
 harry was determined to perform well in care of magical creatures exam so as not to let hagrid down the practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the forbidden forest where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs the trick was to offer them all milk in turn knarls highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle feed and clean out a fire crab without sustaining serious burns and choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn 
 
 harry could see hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window when examiner a plump little witch this time smiled at him and told him he could leave harry gave hagrid a fleeting before heading back to the castle 
 
 the astronomy theory paper on wednesday morning went well enough harry was not convinced he had got the names of all moons right but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice they had to wait until evening for their practical astronomy the afternoon was devoted instead to divination 
 
 even by low standards in divination the exam went very badly he might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during reading saying it looked to him as though professor marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous tuesday 
 
 well we were always going to fail that one said ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase he had just made harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball only to look up and realise he had been describing his reflection 
 
 we have taken the stupid subject in the first place said harry 
 
 still at least we can give it up now 
 
 yeah said harry no more pretending we care what happens when jupiter and uranus get too friendly 
 
 and from now on i care if my spell die ron just chucking them in the bin where they belong 
 
 harry laughed just as hermione came running up behind them he stopped laughing at once in case it annoyed her 
 
 well i think done all right in arithmancy she said and harry and ron both sighed with relief just time for a quick look over our before dinner then 
 
 when they reached the top of the astronomy tower at eleven they found a perfect night for stargazing cloudless and still the grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air each of them set up his or her telescope and when professor marchbanks gave the word proceeded to fill in the blank they had been given 
 
 professors marchbanks and tofty strolled among them watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing all was quiet except for the rustle of parchment the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand and the scribbling of many quills half an hour passed then ar hour the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished 
 
 as harry completed the constellation orion on his chart however the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more 
 
 harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it now examining venus he looked down at his chart to enter the planet there but something distracted him pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn if they had not been moving and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked even at this distance harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them who seemed to be leading the group 
 
 he could not think why umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight much less accompanied by five others then somebody coughed behind him and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam he had quite forgotten position jamming his eye to his telescope he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when alert for any odd sound he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog 
 
 he looked up his heart hammering there were lights on in windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them the door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold the door closed again and there was silence 
 
 harry felt very uneasy he glanced around to see whether ron or hermione had noticed what he had but professor marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone work harry hastily bent over his and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards cabin figures were now moving across the cabin windows temporarily blocking the light 
 
 he could feel professor eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago but as professor marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the astronomy tower several of the people around harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of cabin 
 
 professor tofty gave another dry little cough 
 
 try and concentrate now boys and girls he said softly 
 
 most people returned to their telescopes harry looked to his left hermione was gazing transfixed at cabin 
 
 ahemtwenty minutes to go said professor tofty 
 
 hermione jumped and returned at once to her harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had venus as mars he bent to correct it 
 
 there was a loud bang from the grounds several people cried ouch when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below 
 
 door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to stun him 
 
 no cried hermione 
 
 my dear said professor tofty in a scandalised voice this is an examination 
 
 but nobody was paying the slightest attention to their any more jets of red light were still flying about beside cabin yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him he was still upright and still as far as harry could see fighting cries and yells echoed across the grounds a man yelled be reasonable hagrid 
 
 hagrid roared reasonable be damned yeh won take me like this dawlish 
 
 harry could see the tiny outline of fang attempting to defend hagrid leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a stunning spell caught him and he fell to the ground hagrid gave a howl of fury lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again hermione gasped both hands over her mouth harry looked round at ron and saw that he too was looking scared none of them had ever seen hagrid in a real temper before 
 
 look squealed parvati who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn 
 
 now really said professor tofty anxiously only sixteen minutes left you know 
 
 but nobody paid him the slightest attention they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside cabin 
 
 how dare you the figure shouted as she ran how dare you 
 
 mcgonagall whispered hermione 
 
 leave him alone say said professor voice through the darkness on what grounds are you attacking him he has done nothing nothing to warrant such 
 
 hermione parvati and lavender all screamed the figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than four stunners at professor mcgonagall halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red then she lifted right off her feet landed hard on her back and moved no more 
 
 galloping gargoyles shouted professor tofty who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely not so much as a warning outrageous behaviour 
 
 cowards bellowed hagrid his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower and several lights flickered back on inside the castle ruddy cowards have some o that an that 
 
 oh my gasped hermione 
 
 hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers judging by their immediate collapse they had been knocked cold harry saw hagrid double over and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell but on the contrary next moment hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his backthen harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders 
 
 get him get him screamed umbridge but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of fists indeed he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over hagrid had turned and begun to run with fang still hung around his neck umbridge sent one last stunning spell after him but it missed and hagrid running towards the distant gates disappeared into the darkness 
 
 there was a long quivering silence as everybody gazed into the grounds then professor voice said feebly um five minutes to go everybody 
 
 though he had only filled in of his chart harry was desperate for the exam to end when it came at last he ron and hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase none of the students were going to bed they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed 
 
 that evil woman gasped hermione who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage trying to sneak up on hagrid in the dead of night 
 
 she clearly wanted to avoid another scene like said ernie macmillan sagely squeezing over to join them 
 
 hagrid did well he said ron who looked more alarmed than impressed how come all the spells bounced off him 
 
 be his giant blood said hermione shakily its very hard to stun a giant like trolls really tough but poor professor mcgonagall four stunners straight in the chest and not exactly young is she 
 
 dreadful dreadful said ernie shaking his head pompously well off to bed night all 
 
 people around them were drifting away still talking excitedly about what they had just seen 
 
 at least they get to take hagrid off to azkaban said ron i spect gone to join dumbledore he 
 
 i suppose so said hermione who looked tearful oh this is awful i really thought dumbledore would be back before long but now lost hagrid too 
 
 they traipsed back to the gryffindor common room to find it full the commotion out in the grounds had woken several people who had hastened to rouse their friends seamus and dean who had arrived ahead of harry ron and hermione were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the astronomy tower 
 
 but why sack hagrid now asked angelina johnson shaking her head not like trelawney been teaching much better than usual this year 
 
 urnbridge hates said hermione bitterly flopping down into an armchair she was always going to try and get hagrid out 
 
 and she thought hagrid was putting nifflers in her office piped up katie bell 
 
 oh blimey said lee jordan covering his mouth me been putting the nifflers in her office fred and george left me a couple been levitating them in through her window 
 
 have sacked him anyway said dean he was too close to dumbledore 
 
 true said harry sinking into an armchair beside 
 
 i just hope professor all right said lavender tearfully 
 
 they carried her back up to the castle we watched through the dormitory window said colin creevey she look very well 
 
 madam pomfrey will sort her out said alicia spinnet firmly never failed yet 
 
 it was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared harry felt wide awake the image of hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him he was so angry with umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her though suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving skrewts had its merits he fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested 
 
 their final exam history of magic was not to take place until that afternoon harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of revision so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the window trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the stack of notes that hermione had lent him 
 
 the entered the great hall at two and took their places in front of their examination papers harry felt exhausted he just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep then tomorrow he and ron were going to go down to the quidditch pitchhe was going to have a fly on broomand savour their freedom from revision 
 
 turn over your papers said professor marchbanks from the front of the hall flicking over the giant you may begin 
 
 harry stared fixedly at the first question it was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows slowly tortuously he at last began to write an answer 
 
 he was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates he simply skipped question four in your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riots of the eighteenth century thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end he had a stab at question five how was the statute of secrecy breached in and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere 
 
 he looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the international confederation of wizards and explain why the warlocks of liechtenstein refused to join 
 
 i know this harry thought though his brain felt torpid and slack he could visualise a heading in handwriting the formation of the international confederation of wizards he had read those notes only this morning 
 
 he began to write looking up now and again to check the large on the desk beside professor marchbanks he was sitting right behind parvati patil whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it 
 
 the first supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards was pierre bonaccord but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of liechtenstein because 
 
 all around harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying burrowing rats the sun was very hot on the back of his head what was it that bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of liechtenstein harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls he gazed blankly at the back of head again if he could only perform legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between pierre bonaccord and liechtenstein 
 
 harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool bonaccord had wanted to stop and give the trolls rights but liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls that was it 
 
 he opened his eyes they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what he had done so far it did not seem very informative or detailed yet he was sure notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages 
 
 he closed his eyes again trying to see them trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in france yes he had written that already 
 
 goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too 
 
 and nobody from liechtenstein had wanted to come 
 
 think he told himself his face in his hands while all around him quills scratched out answers and the sand trickled through the at the front 
 
 he was walking along the cool dark corridor to the department of mysteries again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last the black door swung open for him as usual and here he was in the circular room with its many doors 
 
 straight across the stone floor and through the second door patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry 
 
 he jogged the last few feet to the third door which swung open just like the others 
 
 once again he was in the room full of shelves and glass spheres his heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time when he reached number he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows 
 
 but there was a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal stomach contracted with fear with excitement 
 
 a voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness 
 
 take it for me lift it down now i cannot touch it but you can 
 
 the black shape on the floor shifted a little harry saw a white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm heard the high cold voice say crucio 
 
 the man on the floor let out a scream of pain attempted to stand but fell back writhing harry was laughing he raised his wand the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless 
 
 lord voldemort is waiting 
 
 very slowly his arms trembling the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head his face was bloodstained and gaunt twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance 
 
 have to kill me whispered sirius 
 
 undoubtedly i shall in the end said the cold voice but you will fetch it for me first black you think you have felt pain thus far think again we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream 
 
 but somebody screamed as voldemort lowered his wand again somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor harry awoke as he hit the ground still yelling his scar on fire as the great hall erupted all around him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 euphoria at helping gryffindor scrape the quidditch cup was such that he settle to anything next day all he wanted to do was talk over the match so harry and hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention grawp not that either of them tried very hard neither was keen to be the one to bring ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion as it was another fine warm day they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room ron was not particularly keen on this idea at firsthe was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every gryffindor who walked past his chair not to mention the occasional outbursts of weasley is our after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good 
 
 they spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time 
 
 well i mean already let in that one of so i feeling all that confident but i dunno when bradley came towards me just out of nowhere i thoughtyou can do this and i had about a second to decide which way to fly you know because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop my right obviously his leftbut i had a funny feeling that he was feinting and so i took the chance and flew lefthis right i meanandwellyou saw what happened he concluded modestly sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to thema bunch of gossiping hufflepuffshad heard him and then when chambers came at me about five minutes laterwhat ron asked having stopped at the look on face why are you grinning 
 
 not said harry quickly and looked down at his transfiguration notes attempting to straighten his lace the truth was that ron had just reminded harry forcibly of another gryffindor quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree just glad we won all 
 
 yeah said ron slowly savouring the words we you see the look on face when ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose 
 
 i suppose she cried did she said harry bitterly 
 
 well yeah more out of temper than anything though ron frowned slightly but you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground you 
 
 er said harry 
 
 well actually no ron said hermione with a heavy sigh putting down her book and looking at him apologetically as a matter of fact the only bit of the match harry and i saw was first goal 
 
 carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment you watch he said faintly looking from one to the other you see me make any of those saves 
 
 wellno said hermione stretching out a placatory hand towards him but ron we want to leavewe had to 
 
 yeah said ron whose face was growing rather red how come 
 
 it was hagrid said harry he decided to tell us why been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants he wanted us to go into the forest with him we had no choice you know how he gets anyway 
 
 the story was told in five minutes by the end of which indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity 
 
 he brought one back and hid it in the forest 
 
 yep said harry grimly 
 
 no said ron as though by saying this he could make it untrue no he have 
 
 well he has said hermione firmly about sixteen feet tall enjoys ripping up pine trees and knows me she snorted as hermy 
 
 ron gave a nervous laugh 
 
 and hagrid wants us to 
 
 teach him english yeah said harry 
 
 lost his mind said ron in an almost awed voice 
 
 yes said hermione irritably turning a page of intermediate transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses yes starting to think he has but unfortunately he made harry and me promise 
 
 well just going to have to break your promise all said ron firmly i mean come on got exams and about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching from being chucked out as it is and anyway remember norbert remember aragog have we ever come off better for mixing with any of monster mates 
 
 i know just thatwe promised said hermione in a small voice 
 
 ron smoothed his hair flat again looking preoccupied 
 
 well he sighed hagrid been sacked yet has he hung on this long maybe hang on till the end of term and we have to go near grawp at all 
 
 the castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze june had arrived but to the this meant only one thing their owls were upon them at last 
 
 their teachers were no longer setting them homework lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams the purposeful feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the owls from mind though he did wonder occasionally during potions lessons whether lupin had ever told snape that he must continue giving harry ooclumency tuition if he had then snape had ignored lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring harry this suited harry very well he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with snape and to his relief hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about occlumency she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days 
 
 she was not the only person acting oddly as the owls drew steadily nearer ernie macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices 
 
 how many hours think doing a day he demanded of harry and ron as they queued outside herbology a manic gleam in his eyes 
 
 i dunno said ron a few 
 
 more or less than eight 
 
 less i said ron looking slightly alarmed 
 
 doing eight said ernie puffing out his chest eight or nine getting an hour in before breakfast every day eights my average i can do ten on a good weekend day i did nine and a half on monday not so good on tuesdayonly seven and a quarter then on wednesday 
 
 harry was deeply thankful that professor sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point forcing ernie to abandon his recital 
 
 meanwhile draco malfoy had found a different way to induce panic 
 
 of course not what you know he was heard to tell crabbe and goyle loudly outside potions a few days before the exams were to start who you know now been friendly with the head of the wizarding examinations authority for yearsold griselda had her round for dinner and everthing 
 
 do you think true hermione whispered in alarm to harry and ron 
 
 nothing we can do about it if it is said ron gloomily 
 
 i think true said neville quietly from behind them because griselda marchbanks is a friend of my and never mentioned the 
 
 she like neville asked hermione at once is she strict 
 
 bit like gran really said neville in a subdued voice 
 
 knowing her hurt your chances though will it ron told him encouragingly 
 
 oh i think it will make any difference said neville still more miserably always telling professor marchbanks not as good as my dad well you saw what like at st 
 
 neville looked fixedly at the floor harry ron and hermione glanced at each other but know what to say it was the first time neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital 
 
 meanwhile a flourishing trade in aids to concentration mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and harry and ron were much tempted by the bottle of brain elixir offered to them by ravenclaw eddie carmichael who swore it was solely responsible for the nine outstanding owls he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve galleons ron assured harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left hogwarts and got a job but before they could close the deal hermione had confiscated the bottle from carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet 
 
 hermione we wanted to buy that shouted ron 
 
 be stupid she snarled you might as well take harold powdered dragon claw and have done with it 
 
 got powdered dragon claw said ron eagerly 
 
 not any more said hermione i confiscated that too none of these things actually work you know 
 
 dragon claw does work said ron supposed to be incredible really gives your brain a boost you come over all cunning for a few hourshermione let me have a pinch go on it hurt 
 
 this stuff can said hermione grimly had a look at it and actually dried doxy droppings 
 
 this information took the edge off harry and desire for brain stimulants 
 
 they received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for owls during their next transfiguration lesson 
 
 as you can see professor mcgonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard your owls are spread over two successive weeks you will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons your practical astronomy examination will of course take place at night 
 
 now i must warn you that the most stringent charms have been applied to your examination papers quills are banned from the examination hall as are remembralls detachable cribbing cuffs and ink every year i am afraid to say seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the wizarding examinations rules i can only hope that it is nobody in gryffindor our newheadmistress professor mcgonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that aunt petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt has asked the heads of house to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severelybecause of course your examination results will reflect upon the new regime at the school 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave a tiny sigh harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare 
 
 however that is no reason not to do your very best you have your own futures to think about 
 
 please professor said hermione her hand in the air when will we find out our results 
 
 an owl will be sent to you some time in july said professcr mcgonagall 
 
 excellent said dean thomas in an audible whisper so we have to worry about it till the holidays 
 
 harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in privet drive in six weeks time waiting for his owl results well he thought dully at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer 
 
 their first examination theory of charms was scheduled for monday morning harry agreed to test hermione after lunch on sunday but regretted it almost at once she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of achievements in charming 
 
 why you just do it yourself he said firmly handing the book back to her his eyes watering 
 
 meanwhile ron was reading two years worth of charms notes with his fingers in his ears his lips moving soundlessly seamus finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a substantive charm while dean checked it against the standard book of spells grade and parvati and lavender who were practising basic locomotion charms were making their race each other around the edge of the table 
 
 dinner was a subdued affair that night harry and ron did not talk much but ate with gusto having studied hard all day hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate 
 
 oh my goodness she said faintly staring into the entrance hall is that them is that the examiners 
 
 harry and ron whipped around on their bench through the doors to the great hall they could see umbridge standing with a small group of witches and wizards umbridge harry was pleased to see looked rather nervous 
 
 shall we go and have a closer look said ron 
 
 harry and hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the entrance hall slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners harry thought professor marchbanks must be the tiny stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs umbridge was speaking to her deferentially professor marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf she was answering professor umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart 
 
 journey was fine journey was fine made it plenty of times before she said impatiently now i heard from dumbledore lately she added peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard no idea where he is i suppose 
 
 none at all said umbridge shooting a malevolent look at harry ron and hermione who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as ron pretended to do up his shoelace but i daresay the ministry of magic will track him down soon enough 
 
 i doubt it shouted tiny professor marchbanks not it dumbledore want to be found i should know examined him personally in transfiguration and charms when he did newts did things with a wand never seen before 
 
 yes well said professor umbridge as harry ron and hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared let me show you to the staff room i daresay like a cup of tea after your journey 
 
 it was an uncomfortable sort of an evening everyone was trying to do some revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours he remembered his careers consultation and furious declaration that she would help him become an auror if it was the last thing she did he wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here he knew he was not the only one lying awake but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally one by one they fell asleep 
 
 none of the talked very much at breakfast next day either parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched hermione was rereading achievements in charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred and neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade 
 
 once breakfast was over the fifth and milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons then at half past nine they were called forwards class by class to the great hall which had been rearranged exactly as harry had seen it in the pensieve when his father sirius and snape had been taking their owls the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one all facing the end of the hall where professor mcgonagall stood facing them when they were all seated and quiet she said you may begin and turned over an enormous on the desk beside her on which there were also spare quills ink bottles and rolls of parchment 
 
 harry turned over his paper his heart thumping hardthree rows to his right and four seats ahead hermione was already scribblingand lowered his eyes to the first question a give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make objects fly 
 
 harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write 
 
 well it too bad was it asked hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later still clutching the exam paper not sure i did myself justice on cheering charms i just ran out of time did you put in the for hiccoughs i sure whether i ought to it felt like too muchand on question 
 
 hermione said ron sternly been through this before not going through every exam afterwards bad enough doing them once 
 
 the ate lunch with the rest of the school the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the great hall where they were to wait until called for their practical examination as small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake 
 
 name was called trembling she left the chamber with anthony goldstein gregory goyle and daphne greengrass students who had already been tested did not return afterwards so harry and ron had no idea how hermione had done 
 
 be fine remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our charms tests said ron 
 
 ten minutes later professor flitwick called parkinson pansypatil padmapatil parvatipotter harry 
 
 good luck said ron quietly harry walked into the great hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook 
 
 professor tofty is free potter squeaked professor flitwick who was standing just inside the door he pointed harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner a short distance from professor marchbanks who was halfway through testing draco malfoy 
 
 potter is it said professor tofty consulting his notes and peering over his at harry as he approached the famous potter 
 
 out of the corner of his eye harry distinctly saw malfoy throw a scathing look over at him the malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed harry could not suppress a grin professor tofty smiled back at him encouragingly 
 
 it he said in his quavery old voice no need to be nervous now if i could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me 
 
 on the whole harry thought it went rather well his levitation charm was certainly much better than had been though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for colour change and growth charms so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before harry could rectify his mistake he was glad hermione had not been in the hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards he could tell ron though ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened 
 
 there was no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for transfiguration next day harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories 
 
 he forgot the definition of a switching spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse at least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana whereas poor hannah abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos causing the examination to be halted for ten minute while the birds were captured and carried out of the hall 
 
 they had their herbology exam on wednesday other than a small bite from a fanged geranium harry felt he had done reasonably well and then on thursday defence against the dark arts here for the first time harry felt sure he had passed he had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure during the practical examination in performing all the and defensive spells right in front of umbridge who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall 
 
 oh bravo cried professor tolty who was examining harry again when harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell very good indeed well i think all potter unless 
 
 he leaned forwards a little 
 
 i heard from my dear friend tiberius ogden that you can produce a patronus for a bonus point 
 
 harry raised his wand looked directly at umbridge and imagined her being sacked 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 his silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall all of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist professor tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically 
 
 excellent he said very well potter you may go 
 
 as harry passed umbridge beside the door their eyes met there was a nasty smile playing around her wide slack mouth but he did not care unless he was very much mistaken and he was not planning on telling anybody in case he was he had just achieved an outstanding owl 
 
 on friday harry and ron had a day off while hermione sat her ancient runes exam and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision they stretched and yawned beside the open window through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess harry could see hagrid in the distance teaching a class on the edge of the forest he was trying to guess what creatures they were examininghe thought it must be unicorns because the boys seemed to be standing back a littlewhen the portrait hole opened and hermione clambered in looking thoroughly 
 
 how were the runes said ron yawning and stretching 
 
 i ehwaz said hermione furiously it means partnership not mixed it up with eihwaz 
 
 ah well said ron lazily only one mistake it still get 
 
 oh shut up said hermione angrily it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail and more put another niffler in office i know how they got it through that new door but i just walked past there and umbridge is shrieking her head offby the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg 
 
 good said harry and ron together 
 
 it is not good said hermione hotly she thinks hagrid doing it remember and we do not want hagrid chucked out 
 
 teaching at the moment she blame him said harry gesturing out of the window 
 
 oh so naive sometimes harry you really think umbridge will wait for proof said hermione who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off towards the girls dormitories banging the door behind her 
 
 such a lovely girl said ron very quietly prodding his queen forward to beat up one of knights 
 
 bad mood persisted for most of the weekend though harry and ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of saturday and sunday revising for potions on monday the exam which harry had been looking forward to leastand which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an auror sure enough he found the written paper difficult though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about polyjuice potion he could describe its effects accurately having taken it illegally in his second year 
 
 the afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be with snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions neville who was sitting very near harry also looked happier than harry had ever seen him during a potions class when professor marchbanks said step away from your cauldrons please the examination is over harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had with luck avoided a fail 
 
 only four exams left said parvati patil wearily as they headed back to gryffindor common room 
 
 only said hermione snappishly got arithmancy and probably the toughest subject there is 
 
 nobody was foolish enough to snap back so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some for giggling too loudly in the common room 
 
 harry was determined to perform well in care of magical creatures exam so as not to let hagrid down the practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the forbidden forest where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs the trick was to offer them all milk in turn knarls highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle feed and clean out a fire crab without sustaining serious burns and choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn 
 
 harry could see hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window when examiner a plump little witch this time smiled at him and told him he could leave harry gave hagrid a fleeting before heading back to the castle 
 
 the astronomy theory paper on wednesday morning went well enough harry was not convinced he had got the names of all moons right but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice they had to wait until evening for their practical astronomy the afternoon was devoted instead to divination 
 
 even by low standards in divination the exam went very badly he might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during reading saying it looked to him as though professor marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous tuesday 
 
 well we were always going to fail that one said ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase he had just made harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball only to look up and realise he had been describing his reflection 
 
 we have taken the stupid subject in the first place said harry 
 
 still at least we can give it up now 
 
 yeah said harry no more pretending we care what happens when jupiter and uranus get too friendly 
 
 and from now on i care if my spell die ron just chucking them in the bin where they belong 
 
 harry laughed just as hermione came running up behind them he stopped laughing at once in case it annoyed her 
 
 well i think done all right in arithmancy she said and harry and ron both sighed with relief just time for a quick look over our before dinner then 
 
 when they reached the top of the astronomy tower at eleven they found a perfect night for stargazing cloudless and still the grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air each of them set up his or her telescope and when professor marchbanks gave the word proceeded to fill in the blank they had been given 
 
 professors marchbanks and tofty strolled among them watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing all was quiet except for the rustle of parchment the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand and the scribbling of many quills half an hour passed then ar hour the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished 
 
 as harry completed the constellation orion on his chart however the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more 
 
 harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it now examining venus he looked down at his chart to enter the planet there but something distracted him pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn if they had not been moving and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked even at this distance harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them who seemed to be leading the group 
 
 he could not think why umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight much less accompanied by five others then somebody coughed behind him and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam he had quite forgotten position jamming his eye to his telescope he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when alert for any odd sound he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog 
 
 he looked up his heart hammering there were lights on in windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them the door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold the door closed again and there was silence 
 
 harry felt very uneasy he glanced around to see whether ron or hermione had noticed what he had but professor marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone work harry hastily bent over his and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards cabin figures were now moving across the cabin windows temporarily blocking the light 
 
 he could feel professor eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago but as professor marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the astronomy tower several of the people around harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of cabin 
 
 professor tofty gave another dry little cough 
 
 try and concentrate now boys and girls he said softly 
 
 most people returned to their telescopes harry looked to his left hermione was gazing transfixed at cabin 
 
 ahemtwenty minutes to go said professor tofty 
 
 hermione jumped and returned at once to her harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had venus as mars he bent to correct it 
 
 there was a loud bang from the grounds several people cried ouch when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below 
 
 door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to stun him 
 
 no cried hermione 
 
 my dear said professor tofty in a scandalised voice this is an examination 
 
 but nobody was paying the slightest attention to their any more jets of red light were still flying about beside cabin yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him he was still upright and still as far as harry could see fighting cries and yells echoed across the grounds a man yelled be reasonable hagrid 
 
 hagrid roared reasonable be damned yeh won take me like this dawlish 
 
 harry could see the tiny outline of fang attempting to defend hagrid leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a stunning spell caught him and he fell to the ground hagrid gave a howl of fury lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again hermione gasped both hands over her mouth harry looked round at ron and saw that he too was looking scared none of them had ever seen hagrid in a real temper before 
 
 look squealed parvati who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn 
 
 now really said professor tofty anxiously only sixteen minutes left you know 
 
 but nobody paid him the slightest attention they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside cabin 
 
 how dare you the figure shouted as she ran how dare you 
 
 mcgonagall whispered hermione 
 
 leave him alone say said professor voice through the darkness on what grounds are you attacking him he has done nothing nothing to warrant such 
 
 hermione parvati and lavender all screamed the figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than four stunners at professor mcgonagall halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red then she lifted right off her feet landed hard on her back and moved no more 
 
 galloping gargoyles shouted professor tofty who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely not so much as a warning outrageous behaviour 
 
 cowards bellowed hagrid his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower and several lights flickered back on inside the castle ruddy cowards have some o that an that 
 
 oh my gasped hermione 
 
 hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers judging by their immediate collapse they had been knocked cold harry saw hagrid double over and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell but on the contrary next moment hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his backthen harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders 
 
 get him get him screamed umbridge but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of fists indeed he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over hagrid had turned and begun to run with fang still hung around his neck umbridge sent one last stunning spell after him but it missed and hagrid running towards the distant gates disappeared into the darkness 
 
 there was a long quivering silence as everybody gazed into the grounds then professor voice said feebly um five minutes to go everybody 
 
 though he had only filled in of his chart harry was desperate for the exam to end when it came at last he ron and hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase none of the students were going to bed they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed 
 
 that evil woman gasped hermione who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage trying to sneak up on hagrid in the dead of night 
 
 she clearly wanted to avoid another scene like said ernie macmillan sagely squeezing over to join them 
 
 hagrid did well he said ron who looked more alarmed than impressed how come all the spells bounced off him 
 
 be his giant blood said hermione shakily its very hard to stun a giant like trolls really tough but poor professor mcgonagall four stunners straight in the chest and not exactly young is she 
 
 dreadful dreadful said ernie shaking his head pompously well off to bed night all 
 
 people around them were drifting away still talking excitedly about what they had just seen 
 
 at least they get to take hagrid off to azkaban said ron i spect gone to join dumbledore he 
 
 i suppose so said hermione who looked tearful oh this is awful i really thought dumbledore would be back before long but now lost hagrid too 
 
 they traipsed back to the gryffindor common room to find it full the commotion out in the grounds had woken several people who had hastened to rouse their friends seamus and dean who had arrived ahead of harry ron and hermione were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the astronomy tower 
 
 but why sack hagrid now asked angelina johnson shaking her head not like trelawney been teaching much better than usual this year 
 
 urnbridge hates said hermione bitterly flopping down into an armchair she was always going to try and get hagrid out 
 
 and she thought hagrid was putting nifflers in her office piped up katie bell 
 
 oh blimey said lee jordan covering his mouth me been putting the nifflers in her office fred and george left me a couple been levitating them in through her window 
 
 have sacked him anyway said dean he was too close to dumbledore 
 
 true said harry sinking into an armchair beside 
 
 i just hope professor all right said lavender tearfully 
 
 they carried her back up to the castle we watched through the dormitory window said colin creevey she look very well 
 
 madam pomfrey will sort her out said alicia spinnet firmly never failed yet 
 
 it was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared harry felt wide awake the image of hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him he was so angry with umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her though suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving skrewts had its merits he fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested 
 
 their final exam history of magic was not to take place until that afternoon harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of revision so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the window trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the stack of notes that hermione had lent him 
 
 the entered the great hall at two and took their places in front of their examination papers harry felt exhausted he just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep then tomorrow he and ron were going to go down to the quidditch pitchhe was going to have a fly on broomand savour their freedom from revision 
 
 turn over your papers said professor marchbanks from the front of the hall flicking over the giant you may begin 
 
 harry stared fixedly at the first question it was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows slowly tortuously he at last began to write an answer 
 
 he was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates he simply skipped question four in your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riots of the eighteenth century thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end he had a stab at question five how was the statute of secrecy breached in and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere 
 
 he looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the international confederation of wizards and explain why the warlocks of liechtenstein refused to join 
 
 i know this harry thought though his brain felt torpid and slack he could visualise a heading in handwriting the formation of the international confederation of wizards he had read those notes only this morning 
 
 he began to write looking up now and again to check the large on the desk beside professor marchbanks he was sitting right behind parvati patil whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it 
 
 the first supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards was pierre bonaccord but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of liechtenstein because 
 
 all around harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying burrowing rats the sun was very hot on the back of his head what was it that bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of liechtenstein harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls he gazed blankly at the back of head again if he could only perform legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between pierre bonaccord and liechtenstein 
 
 harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool bonaccord had wanted to stop and give the trolls rights but liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls that was it 
 
 he opened his eyes they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what he had done so far it did not seem very informative or detailed yet he was sure notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages 
 
 he closed his eyes again trying to see them trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in france yes he had written that already 
 
 goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too 
 
 and nobody from liechtenstein had wanted to come 
 
 think he told himself his face in his hands while all around him quills scratched out answers and the sand trickled through the at the front 
 
 he was walking along the cool dark corridor to the department of mysteries again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last the black door swung open for him as usual and here he was in the circular room with its many doors 
 
 straight across the stone floor and through the second door patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry 
 
 he jogged the last few feet to the third door which swung open just like the others 
 
 once again he was in the room full of shelves and glass spheres his heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time when he reached number he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows 
 
 but there was a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal stomach contracted with fear with excitement 
 
 a voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness 
 
 take it for me lift it down now i cannot touch it but you can 
 
 the black shape on the floor shifted a little harry saw a white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm heard the high cold voice say crucio 
 
 the man on the floor let out a scream of pain attempted to stand but fell back writhing harry was laughing he raised his wand the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless 
 
 lord voldemort is waiting 
 
 very slowly his arms trembling the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head his face was bloodstained and gaunt twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance 
 
 have to kill me whispered sirius 
 
 undoubtedly i shall in the end said the cold voice but you will fetch it for me first black you think you have felt pain thus far think again we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream 
 
 but somebody screamed as voldemort lowered his wand again somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor harry awoke as he hit the ground still yelling his scar on fire as the great hall erupted all around him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the battle of hogwartscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the enchanted ceiling of the great hall was dark and scattered with stars and below it the four long house tables were lined with disheveled students some in traveling cloaks others in dressing gowns here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts every eye living and dead was fixed upon professor mcgonagall who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the hall behind her stood the remaining teaches including the palomino centaur firenze and the members of the order of the phoenix who had arrived to fight 
 
 evacuation will be overseen by mr filch and madame pomfrey prefects when i give the word you will organize your house and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point 
 
 many of the students looked petrified however as harry skirted the walls scanning the gryffindor table for ron and hermione ernie macmillan stood up at the hufflepuff table and shouted and what if we want to stay and fight 
 
 there was a smattering of applause 
 
 if you are of age you may stay said professor mcgonagall 
 
 what about our things called a girl at the ravenclaw table our trunks our owls 
 
 we have no time to collect possessions said professor mcgonagall the important thing is to get you out of here safely 
 
 wheres professor snape shouted a girl from the slytherin table 
 
 he has to use the common phrase done a bunk replied professor mcgonagall and a great cheer erupted from the gryffindors hufflepuffs and ravenclaws 
 
 harry moved up the hall alongside the gryffindor table still looking for ron and hermione as he passed faces turned in his direction and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake 
 
 we have already placed protection around the castle professor mcgonagall was saying but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it i must ask you therefore to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects c 
 
 but her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the hall it was high cold and clear there was no telling from where it came it seemed to issue from the walls themselves like the monster it had once commanded it might have lain dormant there for centuries 
 
 i know that you are preparing to fight there were screams amongst the students some of whom clutched each other looking around in terror for the source of the sound your efforts are futile you cannot fight me i do not want to kill you i have great respect for the teachers of hogwarts i do not want to spill magical blood 
 
 there was silence in the hall now the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums that seems too huge to be contained by walls 
 
 give me harry potter said voldemorts voice and they shall not be harmed give me harry potter and i shall leave the school untouched give me harry potter and you will be rewarded 
 
 you have until midnight 
 
 the silence swallowed them all again every head turned every eye in the place seemed to have found harry to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams then a figure rose from the slytherin table and he recognized pansy parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed but hes there potters there someone grab him 
 
 before harry could speak there was a massive movement the gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing not harry but the slytherins then the hufflepuffs stood and almost at the same moment the ravenclaws all of them with their backs to harry all of them looking toward pansy instead and harry awestruck and overwhelmed saw wands emerging everywhere pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves 
 
 thank you miss parkinson said professor mcgonagall in a clipped voice you will leave the hall first with mr filch if the rest of your house could follow 
 
 harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the slytherins trooping out on the other side of the hall 
 
 ravenclaws follow on cried professor mcgonagall 
 
 slowly the four tables emptied the slytherin table was completely deserted but a number of older ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out even more hufflepuffs stayed behind and half of gryffindor remained in their seats necessitating professor mcgonagalls descent from the teachers platform to chivvy the underage on their way 
 
 absolutely not creevey go and you peakes 
 
 harry hurried over to the weasleys all sitting together at the gryffindor table 
 
 where are ron and hermione 
 
 havent you found began mr weasley looking worried 
 
 but he broke off as kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind 
 
 weve only got half an half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast a battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of hogwarts and the order of the phoenix professors flitwick sprout and mcgonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers c ravenclaw astronomy and gryffindor c where theyll have good overview excellent positions from which to work spells meanwhile remus c he indicated lupin c arthur c he pointed toward mr weasley sitting at the gryffindor table c and i will take groups into the grounds well need somebody to organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school c 
 
 sounds like a job for us called fred indicating himself and george and kingsley nodded his approval 
 
 all right leaders up here and well divide up the troops 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall hurrying up to him as students flooded the platform jostling for position receiving instructions arent you supposed to be looking for something 
 
 what oh said harry oh yeah 
 
 he had almost forgotten about the horcrux almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it the inexplicable absence of ron and hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind 
 
 then go potter go 
 
 right c yeah c 
 
 he sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the great hall again into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students he allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor fear and panic were clouding his thought processes he tried to calm himself to concentrate on finding the horcrux but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass without ron and hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas he slowed down coming to a halt halfway along a passage where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the marauders map out of the pouch around his neck he could not see rons of hermiones names anywhere on it though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the room of requirement might he thought be concealing them he put the map away pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes trying to concentrate 
 
 voldemort thought id go to ravenclaw tower 
 
 there it was a solid fact the place to start voldemort had stationed alecto carrow in the ravenclaw common room and there could be only one explanation voldemort feared that harry already knew his horcrux was connected to that house 
 
 but the only object anyone seemed to associate with ravenclaw was the lost diadem and how could the horcrux be the diadem how was it possible that voldemort the slytherin had found the diadem that had eluded generations of ravenclaws who could have told him where to look when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory 
 
 in living memory 
 
 beneath his fingers harrys eyes flew open again he leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come now in pursuit of his one last hope the sound of hundreds of people marching toward the room of requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs prefects were shouting instructions trying to keep track of the students in their own houses there was much pushing and shouting harry saw zacharias smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue here and there younger students were in tears while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings 
 
 harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor 
 
 nick nick i need to talk to you 
 
 he forced his way back through the tide of students finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where nearly headless nick ghost of gryffindor tower stood waiting for him 
 
 harry my dear boy 
 
 nick made to grasp harrys hands with both of his own harry felt as though they had been thrust into icy water 
 
 nick youve got to help me whos the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 nearly headless nick looked surprised and a little offended 
 
 the gray lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require 
 
 its got to be her c dyou know where she is 
 
 lets see 
 
 nicks head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither peering over the heads of the swarming students 
 
 thats her over there harry the young woman with the long hair 
 
 harry looked in the direction of nicks transparent pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of harry looking at her raised her eyebrows and drifted away through a solid wall 
 
 harry ran after her once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared he saw her at the very end of the passage still gliding smoothly away from him 
 
 hey c wait c come back 
 
 she consented to pause floating a few inches from the ground harry supposed that she was beautiful with her hair and cloak but she also looked haughty and proud close in he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor but to whom he had never spoken 
 
 youre the gray lady 
 
 she nodded but did not speak 
 
 the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 that is correct 
 
 her tone was not encouraging 
 
 please i need some help i need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem 
 
 a cold smile curved her lips 
 
 i am afraid she said turning to leave that i cannot help you 
 
 wait 
 
 he had not meant to shout but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him he glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him it was a quarter to midnight 
 
 this is urgent he said fiercely if that diadems at hogwarts ive got to find it fast 
 
 you are hardly the first student to covet the diadem she said disdainfully generations of students have badgered me c 
 
 this isnt about trying to get better marks harry shouted at her its about voldemort c defeating voldemort c or arent you interested in that 
 
 she could not blush but her transparent cheeks became more opaque and her voice was heated as she replied of course i c how dare you suggest c 
 
 well help me then 
 
 her composure was slipping 
 
 it c it is not a question of c she stammered my mothers diadem c 
 
 your mothers 
 
 she looked angry with herself 
 
 when i lived she said stiffly i was helena ravenclaw 
 
 youre her daughter but then you must know what happed to it 
 
 while the diadem bestows wisdom she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together i doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself lord c 
 
 havent i told you im not interested in wearing it harry said fiercely theres no time to explain c but if you care about hogwarts if you want to see voldemort finished youve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem 
 
 she remained quite still floating in midair staring down at him and a sense of hopelessness engulfed harry of course if she had known anything she would have told flitwick of dumbledore who had surely asked her the same question he had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice 
 
 i stole the diadem from my mother 
 
 you c you did what 
 
 i stole the diadem repeated helena ravenclaw in a whisper i sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother i ran away with it 
 
 he did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask he simply listened hard as she went on 
 
 my mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still she concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of hogwarts 
 
 then my mother fell ill c fatally ill in spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time she sent a man who had long loved me though i spurned his advances to find me she knew that he would not rest until he had done so 
 
 harry waited she drew a deep breath and threw back her head 
 
 he tracked me to the forest where i was hiding when i refused to return with him he became violent the baron was always a man furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me 
 
 the baron you mean 
 
 the bloody baron yes said the gray lady and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest 
 
 when he saw what he had done he was overcome with remorse he took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself all these centuries later he wears his chains as an act of penitence as he should she added bitterly 
 
 and c and the diadem 
 
 it remained where i had hidden it when i heard the baron blundering through the forest toward me concealed inside a hollow tree 
 
 a hollow tree repeated harry what tree where was this 
 
 a forest in albania a lonely place i thought was far beyond my mothers reach 
 
 albania repeated harry sense was emerging miraculously from confusion and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied dumbledore and flitwick youve already told someone this story havent you another student 
 
 she closed her eyes and nodded 
 
 i had no idea he was flattering he seemed to understand to sympathize 
 
 yes harry thought tom riddle would certainly have understood helena ravenclaws desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right 
 
 well you werent the first person riddle wormed things out of harry muttered he could be charming when he wanted 
 
 so voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the gray lady he had traveled to that forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place perhaps as soon as he left hogwarts before he even started work at borgin and burkes 
 
 and wouldnt those secluded albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when so much later voldemort and needed a place to lie low undisturbed for ten long years 
 
 but the diadem once it became his precious horcrux had not been left in that lowly tree no the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home and voldemort must have put it there c 
 
 c the night he asked for a job said harry finishing his thought 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 he hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked dumbledore to let him teach said harry saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all he mustve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from dumbledores office but it was well worth trying to get the job c then he mightve got the chance to nick gryffindors sword as well c thank you thanks 
 
 harry left her floating there looking utterly bewildered as he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall he checked his watch it was five minutes until midnight and though he now knew what the last horcrux was he was no closer to discovering where it was 
 
 generations of students had failed to find the diadem that suggested that it was not in ravenclaw tower c but if not there where what hiding place had tom riddle discovered inside hogwarts castle that he believed would remain secret forever 
 
 lost in desperate speculation harry turned a corner but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening shattering crash as he leapt aside a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall 
 
 something large and furry detached itself whimpering from the new arrival and flung itself at harry 
 
 hagrid harry bellowed fighting off fang the boarhounds attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet what the c 
 
 harry yer here yer here 
 
 hagrid stooped down bestowed upon harry a cursory and hug then ran back to the shattered window 
 
 good boy grawpy he bellowed through the hole in the window ill se yer in a moment theres a good lad 
 
 beyond hagrid out in the dark night harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird keening scream he looked down at his watch it was midnight the battle had begun 
 
 blimey harry panted hagrid this is it eh time ter fight 
 
 hagrid where have you come from 
 
 heard from up in our cave said hagrid grimly voice carried didnt it yet got till midnight ter gimme potter knew yeh mus be here knew that mus be happenin get down fang so we come ter join in me an grawpy an fang smashed our way through the boundary by the forest grawpy was carryin us fang an me told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him not exactly what i meant bu c wheres ron an hermione 
 
 that said harry is a really good question come on 
 
 they hurried together along the corridor fang lolloping beside them harry could hear movement through the corridors all around running footsteps shouts through the windows he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds 
 
 wherere we goin puffed hagrid pounding along at harrys heels making the floorboards quake 
 
 i dunno exactly said harry making another random turn but ron and hermione must be around here somewhere 
 
 the first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead the two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window their remains stirred feebly on the floor and as harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads it moaned faintly oh dont mind me ill just be here and crumble 
 
 its ugly stone face made harry think suddenly of the marble bust of rowena ravenclaw at xenophiliuss house wearing that mad headdress c and then of the statue in ravenclaw tower with the stone diadem upon her white curls 
 
 and as he reached the end of the passage the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him that of an ugly old warlock onto whose head harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old hat the shock shot through harry with the heat of firewhisky and he nearly stumbled 
 
 he knew at least where the horcrux sat waiting for him 
 
 tom riddle who confided in no one and operated alone might have been arrogant enough to assume that he and only he had penetrated the deepest mysteries of hogwarts castle of course dumbledore and flitwick those model pupils had never set foot in that particular place but he harry had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school c here at least was a secret area he and voldemort knew that dumbledore had never discovered c 
 
 he was roused by professor sprout who was thundering past followed by neville and half a dozen others all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants 
 
 mandrakes neville bellowed at harry over his shoulder as he ran going to lob them over the walls c they wont like this 
 
 harry knew now where to go he sped off with hagrid and fang galloping behind him they passed portrait after portrait and the painted figures raced alongside them wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches in armor and cloaks cramming themselves into each others canvases screaming news from other parts of the castle as they reached the end of this corridor the whole castle shook and harry knew as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the order 
 
 its all righ fang c its all righ yelled hagrid but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air and hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog leaving harry alone 
 
 he forged on through the trembling passages his wand at the ready and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight sir cadrigan rushed from painting to painting beside him clanking along in his armor screaming encouragement his fat little pony cantering behind him 
 
 braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out harry potter see them off 
 
 harry hurtled around a corner and found fred and a small knot of students including lee jordan and hannah abbott standing beside another empty plinth whose statue had concealed a secret passageway their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole 
 
 nice night for it fred shouted as the castle quaked again and harry sprinted by elated and terrified in equal measure along yet another corridor he dashed and then there were owls everywhere and mrs norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws no doubt to return them to their proper place 
 
 potter 
 
 aberforth dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead his wand held ready 
 
 ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub potter 
 
 i know were evacuating harry said voldemorts c 
 
 c attacking because they havent handed you over yeah said aberforth im not deaf the whole of hogsmeade heard him and it never occurred to any of you to keep a few slytherins hostage there are kids of death eaters youve just sent to safety wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here 
 
 it wouldnt stop voldemort said harry and your brother would never have done it 
 
 aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction 
 
 your brother would never have done it well it was the truth harry thought as he ran on again dumbledore who had defended snape for so long would never have held students ransom 
 
 and then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them ron and hermione both with their arms full of large curved dirty yellow objects ron with a broomstick under his arms 
 
 where the hell have you been harry shouted 
 
 chamber of secrets said ron 
 
 chamber c what said harry coming to an unsteady halt before them 
 
 it was ron all rons idea said hermione breathlessly wasnt it absolutely brilliant there we were after we left and i said to ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it we still hadnt got rid of the cup and then he thought of it the basilisk 
 
 what the c 
 
 something to get rid of horcruxes said ron simply 
 
 harrys eyes dropped to the objects clutched in ron and hermiones arms great curved fangs torn he now realized from the skull of a dead basilisk 
 
 but how did you get in there he asked staring from the fangs to ron you need to speak parseltongue 
 
 he did whispered hermione show him ron 
 
 ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise 
 
 its what you did to open the locket he told harry apologetically i had to have a few goes to get it right but he shrugged modestly we got there in the end 
 
 he was amazing said hermione amazing 
 
 so harry was struggling to keep up so 
 
 so were another horcrux down said ron and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of hufflepuffs cup hermione stabbed it thought she should she hasnt had the pleasure yet 
 
 genius yelled harry 
 
 it was nothing said ron though he looked delighted with himself so whats new with you 
 
 as he said it there was an explosion from overhead all three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream 
 
 i know what the diadem looks like and i know where it is said harry talking fast he hid it exactly where i had my old potions book where everyones been hiding stuff for centuries he thought he was the only one to find it come on 
 
 as the walls trembled again he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the room of requirement it was empty except for three women ginny tonks and an elderly witch wearing a hat whom harry recognized immediately as nevilles grandmother 
 
 ah potter she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him you can tell us whats going on 
 
 is everyone okay said ginny and tonks together 
 
 s far as we know said harry are there still people in the passage to the hogs head 
 
 he knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it 
 
 i was the last to come through said mrs longbottom i sealed it i think it unwise to leave it open now aberforth has left his pub have you seen my grandson 
 
 hes fighting said harry 
 
 naturally said the old lady proudly excuse me i must go and assist him 
 
 with surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps 
 
 harry looked at tonks 
 
 i thought you were supposed to be with teddy at your mothers 
 
 i couldnt stand not knowing c tonks looked anguished shell look after him c have you seen remus 
 
 he was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds c 
 
 without another word tonks sped off 
 
 ginny said harry im sorry but we need you to leave too just for a bit then you can come back in 
 
 ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary 
 
 and then you can come back in he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after tonks youve got to come back in 
 
 hang on a moment said ron sharply weve forgotten someone 
 
 who asked hermione 
 
 the theyll all be down in the kitchen wont they 
 
 you mean we ought to get them fighting asked harry 
 
 no said ron seriously i mean we should tell them to get out we dont want anymore dobbies do we we cant order them to die for us c 
 
 there was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of hermiones arms running at ron she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted hermione off her feet 
 
 is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here 
 
 ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other 
 
 i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it 
 
 never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just c just hold it in until weve got the diadem 
 
 yeah c right c sorry c said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face 
 
 it was clear as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs that in the minutes that they had spent in the room of requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever dust filled the air and through the nearest window harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the death eaters must be very near to entering the place looking down harry saw grawp the giant meandering past swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure 
 
 lets hope he steps on some of them said ron as more screams echoed from close by 
 
 as long as its not any of our lot said a voice harry turned and saw ginny and tonks both with their wands drawn at the next window which was missing several panes even as he watched ginny sent a jinx into a crowd of fighters below 
 
 good girl roared a figure running through the dust toward them and harry saw aberforth again his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past they look like they might be breaching the north battlements theyve brought giants of their own 
 
 have you seen remus tonks called after him 
 
 he was dueling dolohov shouted aberforth havent seen him since 
 
 tonks said ginny tonks im sure hes okay c 
 
 but tonks had run off into the dust after aberforth 
 
 ginny turned helpless to harry ron and hermione 
 
 theyll be all right said harry though he knew they were empty words ginny well be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe c come on he said to ron and hermione and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the room of requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant 
 
 i need the place where everything is hidden harry begged of it inside his head and the door materialized on their third run past 
 
 the furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them all was silent they were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of students 
 
 and he never realized anyone could get in said ron his voice echoing in the silence 
 
 he thought he was the only one said harry too bad for him ive had to hide stuff in my time this way he added i think its down here 
 
 they sped off up adjacent aisles harry could hear the others footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk of bottles hats crates chairs books weapons broomsticks bats 
 
 somewhere near here harry muttered to himself somewhere somewhere 
 
 deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room his breath was loud in his ears and then his very soul seemed to shiver there it was right ahead the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old potions book and on top of it the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara 
 
 he had already stretched out his hand though he remained few feet away when a voice behind him said hold it potter 
 
 he skidded to a halt and turned around crabbe and goyle were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder wands pointing right at harry through the small space between their jeering faces he saw draco malfoy 
 
 thats my wand youre holding potter said malfoy pointing his own through the gap between crabbe and goyle 
 
 not anymore panted harry tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand winners keepers malfoy whos lent you theirs 
 
 my mother said draco 
 
 harry laughed though there was nothing very humorous about the situation he could not hear ron or hermione anymore they seemed to have run out of earshot searching for the diadem 
 
 so how come you three arent with voldemort asked harry 
 
 were gonna be rewarded said crabbe his voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person harry had hardly ever heard him speak before crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets we ung back potter we decided not to go decided to bring you to im 
 
 good plan said harry in mock admiration he could not believe that he was this close and was going to be thwarted by malfoy crabbe and goyle he began edging slowly backward toward the place where the horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust if he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out 
 
 so how did you get in here he asked trying to distract them 
 
 i virtually lived in the room of hidden things all last year said malfoy his voice brittle i know how to get in 
 
 we was hiding in the corridor outside grunted goyle we can do disslusion charms now and then his face split into a gormless grin you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a whats a 
 
 harry rons voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to harrys right are you talking to someone 
 
 with a whiplike movement crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture of broken trunks of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted descendo 
 
 the wall began to totter then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where ron stood 
 
 ron harry bellowed as somewhere out of sight hermione screamed and harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall he pointed his wand at the rampart cried finite and it steadied 
 
 no shouted malfoy staying crabbes arm as the latter made to repeat his spell if you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing 
 
 whats that matter said crabbe tugging himself free its potter the dark lord wants who cares about a 
 
 potter came in here to get it said malfoy with impatience at the of his colleagues so that must mean c 
 
 must mean crabbe turned on malfoy with undisguised ferocity who cares what you think i dont take your orders no more draco you an your dad are finished 
 
 harry shouted ron again from the other side of the junk wad whats going on 
 
 harry mimicked crabbe whats going on c no potter crucio 
 
 harry had lunged for the tiara crabbes curse missed him but hit the stone bust which flew into the air the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested 
 
 stop malfoy shouted at crabbe his voice echoing through the enormous room the dark lord wants him alive c 
 
 so im not killing him am i yelled crabbe throwing off malfoys restraining arm but if i can i will the dark lord wants him dead anyway whats the diff c 
 
 a jet of scarlet light shot past harry by inches hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a stunning spell straight at crabbes head it only missed because malfoy pulled him out of the way 
 
 its that mudblood avada kedavra 
 
 harry saw hermione dive aside and his fury that crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind he shot a stunning spell at crabbe who lurched out of the way knocking malfoys wand out of his hand it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones 
 
 dont kill him dont kill him malfoy yelled at crabbe and goyle who were both aiming at harry their split seconds hesitation was all harry needed 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 goyles wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him goyle leapt foolishly on the spot trying to retrieve it malfoy jumped out of range of hermiones second stunning spell and ron appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle shot a full curse at crabbe which narrowly missed 
 
 crabbe wheeled around and screamed avada kedavra again ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light the malfoy cowered behind a wardrobe as hermione charged toward them hitting goyle with a stunning spell as she came 
 
 its somewhere here harry yelled at her pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen look for it while i go and help r c 
 
 harry she screamed 
 
 a roaring billowing noise behind him gave him a moments warning he turned and saw both ron and crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them 
 
 like it hot scum roared crabbe as he ran 
 
 but he seemed to have no control over what he had done flames of abnormal size were pursuing them licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks which were crumbling to soot at their touch 
 
 aguamenti harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air 
 
 run 
 
 malfoy grabbed the stunned goyle and dragged him along crabbe outstripped all of them now looking terrified harry ron and hermione pelted along in his wake and the fire pursued them it was not normal fire crabbe had used a curse of which harry had no knowledge as they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive sentient intent upon killing them now the fire was mutating forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts flaming serpents chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths tossed high on clawed feet before being consumed by the inferno 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had vanished from view harry ron and hermione stopped dead the fiery monsters were circling them drawing closer and closer claws and horns and tails lashed and the heat was solid as a wall around them 
 
 what can we do hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire what can we do 
 
 here 
 
 harry seized a pair of broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to ron who pulled hermione onto it behind him harry swung his leg over the second broom and with hard kicks to the ground they soared up in the air missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them the smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room harry could not see a trace of malfoy crabbe or goyle anywhere he swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them but there was nothing but fire what a terrible way to die he had never wanted this 
 
 harry lets get out lets get out bellowed ron though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke 
 
 and then harry heard a thin piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion the thunder of devouring flame 
 
 its c too c dangerous c ron yelled but harry wheeled in the air his glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke he raked the firestorm below seeking a sign of life a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood 
 
 and he saw them malfoy with his arms around the unconscious goyle the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks and harry dived malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm but even as harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good goyle was too heavy and malfoys hand covered in sweat slid instantly out of harrys c 
 
 if we die for them ill kill you harry roared rons voice and as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them he and hermione dragged goyle onto their broom and rose rolling and pitching into the air once more as malfoy clambered up behind harry 
 
 the door get to the door the door screamed malfoy in harrys ear and harry sped up following ron hermione and goyle through the billowing black smoke hardly able to breathe and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration cups and shields a sparkling necklace and an old discolored tiara c 
 
 what are you doing what are you doing the doors that way screamed malfoy but harry made a hairpin swerve and dived the diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist c 
 
 harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him he soared upward and straight toward the place where he prayed the door stood open ron hermione and goyle had vanished malfoy was screaming and holding harry so tightly it hurt then through the smoke harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond 
 
 malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown gasping coughing and retching harry rolled over and sat up the door to the room of requirement had vanished and ron and hermione sat panting on the floor beside goyle who was still unconscious 
 
 choked malfoy as soon as he could speak 
 
 hes dead said ron harshly 
 
 there was silence apart from panting and coughing then a number of huge bangs shook the castle and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms harry staggered to his feet when the headless hunt had passed and looked around the battle was still going on all around him he could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts panic flared within him 
 
 wheres ginny he said sharply she was here she was supposed to be going back into the room of requirement 
 
 blimey dyou reckon itll still work after that fire asked ron but he too got to his feet rubbing his chest and looking left and right shall we split up and look c 
 
 no said hermione getting to her feet too malfoy and goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor neither of them had wands lets stick together i say we go c harry whats that on your arm 
 
 what oh yeah c 
 
 he pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up it was still hot blackened with soot but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure 
 
 a bloodlike substance dark and tarry seemed to be leaking from the diadem suddenly harry felt the thing vibrate violently then break apart in his hands and as it did so he thought he heard the faintest most distant scream of pain echoing not from the grounds or the castle but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers 
 
 it must have been fiendfyre whimpered hermione her eyes on the broken piece 
 
 sorry 
 
 fiendfyre c cursed fire c its one of the substances that destroy horcruxes but i would never ever have dared use it its so dangerous c how did crabbe know how to c 
 
 mustve learned from the carrows said harry grimly 
 
 shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really said ron whose hair like hermiones was singed and whose face was blackened if he hadnt tried to kill us all id be quite sorry he was dead 
 
 but dont you realize whispered hermione this means if we can just get the snake c 
 
 but she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail death eaters had penetrated hogwarts fred and percy had just backed into view both of them dueling masked and hooded men 
 
 harry ron and hermione ran forward to help jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling percy backed off fast then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair c 
 
 hello minister bellowed percy sending a neat jinx straight at thicknesse who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes apparently in awful discomfort did i mention im resigning 
 
 youre joking perce shouted fred as the death eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin fred looked at percy with glee 
 
 you actually are joking perce i dont think ive heard you joke since you were c 
 
 the air exploded they had been grouped together harry ron hermione fred and percy the two death eaters at their feet one stunned the other transfigured and in that fragment of a moment when danger seemed temporarily at bay the world was rent apart harry felt himself flying through the air and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon and shield his head in his arms he heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them c 
 
 and then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness he was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause and he stood up swaying more frightened than he had been that day more frightened perhaps than he had been in his life 
 
 and hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart harry grabbed hermiones hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood 
 
 no c no c no someone was shouting no fred no and percy was shaking his brother and ron was kneeling beside them and freds eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter the battle of hogwartscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the enchanted ceiling of the great hall was dark and scattered with stars and below it the four long house tables were lined with disheveled students some in traveling cloaks others in dressing gowns here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts every eye living and dead was fixed upon professor mcgonagall who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the hall behind her stood the remaining teaches including the palomino centaur firenze and the members of the order of the phoenix who had arrived to fight 
 
 evacuation will be overseen by mr filch and madame pomfrey prefects when i give the word you will organize your house and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point 
 
 many of the students looked petrified however as harry skirted the walls scanning the gryffindor table for ron and hermione ernie macmillan stood up at the hufflepuff table and shouted and what if we want to stay and fight 
 
 there was a smattering of applause 
 
 if you are of age you may stay said professor mcgonagall 
 
 what about our things called a girl at the ravenclaw table our trunks our owls 
 
 we have no time to collect possessions said professor mcgonagall the important thing is to get you out of here safely 
 
 wheres professor snape shouted a girl from the slytherin table 
 
 he has to use the common phrase done a bunk replied professor mcgonagall and a great cheer erupted from the gryffindors hufflepuffs and ravenclaws 
 
 harry moved up the hall alongside the gryffindor table still looking for ron and hermione as he passed faces turned in his direction and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake 
 
 we have already placed protection around the castle professor mcgonagall was saying but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it i must ask you therefore to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects c 
 
 but her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the hall it was high cold and clear there was no telling from where it came it seemed to issue from the walls themselves like the monster it had once commanded it might have lain dormant there for centuries 
 
 i know that you are preparing to fight there were screams amongst the students some of whom clutched each other looking around in terror for the source of the sound your efforts are futile you cannot fight me i do not want to kill you i have great respect for the teachers of hogwarts i do not want to spill magical blood 
 
 there was silence in the hall now the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums that seems too huge to be contained by walls 
 
 give me harry potter said voldemorts voice and they shall not be harmed give me harry potter and i shall leave the school untouched give me harry potter and you will be rewarded 
 
 you have until midnight 
 
 the silence swallowed them all again every head turned every eye in the place seemed to have found harry to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams then a figure rose from the slytherin table and he recognized pansy parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed but hes there potters there someone grab him 
 
 before harry could speak there was a massive movement the gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing not harry but the slytherins then the hufflepuffs stood and almost at the same moment the ravenclaws all of them with their backs to harry all of them looking toward pansy instead and harry awestruck and overwhelmed saw wands emerging everywhere pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves 
 
 thank you miss parkinson said professor mcgonagall in a clipped voice you will leave the hall first with mr filch if the rest of your house could follow 
 
 harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the slytherins trooping out on the other side of the hall 
 
 ravenclaws follow on cried professor mcgonagall 
 
 slowly the four tables emptied the slytherin table was completely deserted but a number of older ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out even more hufflepuffs stayed behind and half of gryffindor remained in their seats necessitating professor mcgonagalls descent from the teachers platform to chivvy the underage on their way 
 
 absolutely not creevey go and you peakes 
 
 harry hurried over to the weasleys all sitting together at the gryffindor table 
 
 where are ron and hermione 
 
 havent you found began mr weasley looking worried 
 
 but he broke off as kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind 
 
 weve only got half an half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast a battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of hogwarts and the order of the phoenix professors flitwick sprout and mcgonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers c ravenclaw astronomy and gryffindor c where theyll have good overview excellent positions from which to work spells meanwhile remus c he indicated lupin c arthur c he pointed toward mr weasley sitting at the gryffindor table c and i will take groups into the grounds well need somebody to organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school c 
 
 sounds like a job for us called fred indicating himself and george and kingsley nodded his approval 
 
 all right leaders up here and well divide up the troops 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall hurrying up to him as students flooded the platform jostling for position receiving instructions arent you supposed to be looking for something 
 
 what oh said harry oh yeah 
 
 he had almost forgotten about the horcrux almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it the inexplicable absence of ron and hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind 
 
 then go potter go 
 
 right c yeah c 
 
 he sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the great hall again into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students he allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor fear and panic were clouding his thought processes he tried to calm himself to concentrate on finding the horcrux but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass without ron and hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas he slowed down coming to a halt halfway along a passage where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the marauders map out of the pouch around his neck he could not see rons of hermiones names anywhere on it though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the room of requirement might he thought be concealing them he put the map away pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes trying to concentrate 
 
 voldemort thought id go to ravenclaw tower 
 
 there it was a solid fact the place to start voldemort had stationed alecto carrow in the ravenclaw common room and there could be only one explanation voldemort feared that harry already knew his horcrux was connected to that house 
 
 but the only object anyone seemed to associate with ravenclaw was the lost diadem and how could the horcrux be the diadem how was it possible that voldemort the slytherin had found the diadem that had eluded generations of ravenclaws who could have told him where to look when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory 
 
 in living memory 
 
 beneath his fingers harrys eyes flew open again he leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come now in pursuit of his one last hope the sound of hundreds of people marching toward the room of requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs prefects were shouting instructions trying to keep track of the students in their own houses there was much pushing and shouting harry saw zacharias smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue here and there younger students were in tears while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings 
 
 harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor 
 
 nick nick i need to talk to you 
 
 he forced his way back through the tide of students finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where nearly headless nick ghost of gryffindor tower stood waiting for him 
 
 harry my dear boy 
 
 nick made to grasp harrys hands with both of his own harry felt as though they had been thrust into icy water 
 
 nick youve got to help me whos the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 nearly headless nick looked surprised and a little offended 
 
 the gray lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require 
 
 its got to be her c dyou know where she is 
 
 lets see 
 
 nicks head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither peering over the heads of the swarming students 
 
 thats her over there harry the young woman with the long hair 
 
 harry looked in the direction of nicks transparent pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of harry looking at her raised her eyebrows and drifted away through a solid wall 
 
 harry ran after her once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared he saw her at the very end of the passage still gliding smoothly away from him 
 
 hey c wait c come back 
 
 she consented to pause floating a few inches from the ground harry supposed that she was beautiful with her hair and cloak but she also looked haughty and proud close in he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor but to whom he had never spoken 
 
 youre the gray lady 
 
 she nodded but did not speak 
 
 the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 that is correct 
 
 her tone was not encouraging 
 
 please i need some help i need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem 
 
 a cold smile curved her lips 
 
 i am afraid she said turning to leave that i cannot help you 
 
 wait 
 
 he had not meant to shout but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him he glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him it was a quarter to midnight 
 
 this is urgent he said fiercely if that diadems at hogwarts ive got to find it fast 
 
 you are hardly the first student to covet the diadem she said disdainfully generations of students have badgered me c 
 
 this isnt about trying to get better marks harry shouted at her its about voldemort c defeating voldemort c or arent you interested in that 
 
 she could not blush but her transparent cheeks became more opaque and her voice was heated as she replied of course i c how dare you suggest c 
 
 well help me then 
 
 her composure was slipping 
 
 it c it is not a question of c she stammered my mothers diadem c 
 
 your mothers 
 
 she looked angry with herself 
 
 when i lived she said stiffly i was helena ravenclaw 
 
 youre her daughter but then you must know what happed to it 
 
 while the diadem bestows wisdom she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together i doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself lord c 
 
 havent i told you im not interested in wearing it harry said fiercely theres no time to explain c but if you care about hogwarts if you want to see voldemort finished youve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem 
 
 she remained quite still floating in midair staring down at him and a sense of hopelessness engulfed harry of course if she had known anything she would have told flitwick of dumbledore who had surely asked her the same question he had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice 
 
 i stole the diadem from my mother 
 
 you c you did what 
 
 i stole the diadem repeated helena ravenclaw in a whisper i sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother i ran away with it 
 
 he did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask he simply listened hard as she went on 
 
 my mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still she concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of hogwarts 
 
 then my mother fell ill c fatally ill in spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time she sent a man who had long loved me though i spurned his advances to find me she knew that he would not rest until he had done so 
 
 harry waited she drew a deep breath and threw back her head 
 
 he tracked me to the forest where i was hiding when i refused to return with him he became violent the baron was always a man furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me 
 
 the baron you mean 
 
 the bloody baron yes said the gray lady and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest 
 
 when he saw what he had done he was overcome with remorse he took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself all these centuries later he wears his chains as an act of penitence as he should she added bitterly 
 
 and c and the diadem 
 
 it remained where i had hidden it when i heard the baron blundering through the forest toward me concealed inside a hollow tree 
 
 a hollow tree repeated harry what tree where was this 
 
 a forest in albania a lonely place i thought was far beyond my mothers reach 
 
 albania repeated harry sense was emerging miraculously from confusion and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied dumbledore and flitwick youve already told someone this story havent you another student 
 
 she closed her eyes and nodded 
 
 i had no idea he was flattering he seemed to understand to sympathize 
 
 yes harry thought tom riddle would certainly have understood helena ravenclaws desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right 
 
 well you werent the first person riddle wormed things out of harry muttered he could be charming when he wanted 
 
 so voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the gray lady he had traveled to that forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place perhaps as soon as he left hogwarts before he even started work at borgin and burkes 
 
 and wouldnt those secluded albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when so much later voldemort and needed a place to lie low undisturbed for ten long years 
 
 but the diadem once it became his precious horcrux had not been left in that lowly tree no the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home and voldemort must have put it there c 
 
 c the night he asked for a job said harry finishing his thought 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 he hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked dumbledore to let him teach said harry saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all he mustve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from dumbledores office but it was well worth trying to get the job c then he mightve got the chance to nick gryffindors sword as well c thank you thanks 
 
 harry left her floating there looking utterly bewildered as he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall he checked his watch it was five minutes until midnight and though he now knew what the last horcrux was he was no closer to discovering where it was 
 
 generations of students had failed to find the diadem that suggested that it was not in ravenclaw tower c but if not there where what hiding place had tom riddle discovered inside hogwarts castle that he believed would remain secret forever 
 
 lost in desperate speculation harry turned a corner but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening shattering crash as he leapt aside a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall 
 
 something large and furry detached itself whimpering from the new arrival and flung itself at harry 
 
 hagrid harry bellowed fighting off fang the boarhounds attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet what the c 
 
 harry yer here yer here 
 
 hagrid stooped down bestowed upon harry a cursory and hug then ran back to the shattered window 
 
 good boy grawpy he bellowed through the hole in the window ill se yer in a moment theres a good lad 
 
 beyond hagrid out in the dark night harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird keening scream he looked down at his watch it was midnight the battle had begun 
 
 blimey harry panted hagrid this is it eh time ter fight 
 
 hagrid where have you come from 
 
 heard from up in our cave said hagrid grimly voice carried didnt it yet got till midnight ter gimme potter knew yeh mus be here knew that mus be happenin get down fang so we come ter join in me an grawpy an fang smashed our way through the boundary by the forest grawpy was carryin us fang an me told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him not exactly what i meant bu c wheres ron an hermione 
 
 that said harry is a really good question come on 
 
 they hurried together along the corridor fang lolloping beside them harry could hear movement through the corridors all around running footsteps shouts through the windows he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds 
 
 wherere we goin puffed hagrid pounding along at harrys heels making the floorboards quake 
 
 i dunno exactly said harry making another random turn but ron and hermione must be around here somewhere 
 
 the first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead the two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window their remains stirred feebly on the floor and as harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads it moaned faintly oh dont mind me ill just be here and crumble 
 
 its ugly stone face made harry think suddenly of the marble bust of rowena ravenclaw at xenophiliuss house wearing that mad headdress c and then of the statue in ravenclaw tower with the stone diadem upon her white curls 
 
 and as he reached the end of the passage the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him that of an ugly old warlock onto whose head harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old hat the shock shot through harry with the heat of firewhisky and he nearly stumbled 
 
 he knew at least where the horcrux sat waiting for him 
 
 tom riddle who confided in no one and operated alone might have been arrogant enough to assume that he and only he had penetrated the deepest mysteries of hogwarts castle of course dumbledore and flitwick those model pupils had never set foot in that particular place but he harry had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school c here at least was a secret area he and voldemort knew that dumbledore had never discovered c 
 
 he was roused by professor sprout who was thundering past followed by neville and half a dozen others all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants 
 
 mandrakes neville bellowed at harry over his shoulder as he ran going to lob them over the walls c they wont like this 
 
 harry knew now where to go he sped off with hagrid and fang galloping behind him they passed portrait after portrait and the painted figures raced alongside them wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches in armor and cloaks cramming themselves into each others canvases screaming news from other parts of the castle as they reached the end of this corridor the whole castle shook and harry knew as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the order 
 
 its all righ fang c its all righ yelled hagrid but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air and hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog leaving harry alone 
 
 he forged on through the trembling passages his wand at the ready and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight sir cadrigan rushed from painting to painting beside him clanking along in his armor screaming encouragement his fat little pony cantering behind him 
 
 braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out harry potter see them off 
 
 harry hurtled around a corner and found fred and a small knot of students including lee jordan and hannah abbott standing beside another empty plinth whose statue had concealed a secret passageway their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole 
 
 nice night for it fred shouted as the castle quaked again and harry sprinted by elated and terrified in equal measure along yet another corridor he dashed and then there were owls everywhere and mrs norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws no doubt to return them to their proper place 
 
 potter 
 
 aberforth dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead his wand held ready 
 
 ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub potter 
 
 i know were evacuating harry said voldemorts c 
 
 c attacking because they havent handed you over yeah said aberforth im not deaf the whole of hogsmeade heard him and it never occurred to any of you to keep a few slytherins hostage there are kids of death eaters youve just sent to safety wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here 
 
 it wouldnt stop voldemort said harry and your brother would never have done it 
 
 aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction 
 
 your brother would never have done it well it was the truth harry thought as he ran on again dumbledore who had defended snape for so long would never have held students ransom 
 
 and then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them ron and hermione both with their arms full of large curved dirty yellow objects ron with a broomstick under his arms 
 
 where the hell have you been harry shouted 
 
 chamber of secrets said ron 
 
 chamber c what said harry coming to an unsteady halt before them 
 
 it was ron all rons idea said hermione breathlessly wasnt it absolutely brilliant there we were after we left and i said to ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it we still hadnt got rid of the cup and then he thought of it the basilisk 
 
 what the c 
 
 something to get rid of horcruxes said ron simply 
 
 harrys eyes dropped to the objects clutched in ron and hermiones arms great curved fangs torn he now realized from the skull of a dead basilisk 
 
 but how did you get in there he asked staring from the fangs to ron you need to speak parseltongue 
 
 he did whispered hermione show him ron 
 
 ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise 
 
 its what you did to open the locket he told harry apologetically i had to have a few goes to get it right but he shrugged modestly we got there in the end 
 
 he was amazing said hermione amazing 
 
 so harry was struggling to keep up so 
 
 so were another horcrux down said ron and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of hufflepuffs cup hermione stabbed it thought she should she hasnt had the pleasure yet 
 
 genius yelled harry 
 
 it was nothing said ron though he looked delighted with himself so whats new with you 
 
 as he said it there was an explosion from overhead all three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream 
 
 i know what the diadem looks like and i know where it is said harry talking fast he hid it exactly where i had my old potions book where everyones been hiding stuff for centuries he thought he was the only one to find it come on 
 
 as the walls trembled again he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the room of requirement it was empty except for three women ginny tonks and an elderly witch wearing a hat whom harry recognized immediately as nevilles grandmother 
 
 ah potter she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him you can tell us whats going on 
 
 is everyone okay said ginny and tonks together 
 
 s far as we know said harry are there still people in the passage to the hogs head 
 
 he knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it 
 
 i was the last to come through said mrs longbottom i sealed it i think it unwise to leave it open now aberforth has left his pub have you seen my grandson 
 
 hes fighting said harry 
 
 naturally said the old lady proudly excuse me i must go and assist him 
 
 with surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps 
 
 harry looked at tonks 
 
 i thought you were supposed to be with teddy at your mothers 
 
 i couldnt stand not knowing c tonks looked anguished shell look after him c have you seen remus 
 
 he was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds c 
 
 without another word tonks sped off 
 
 ginny said harry im sorry but we need you to leave too just for a bit then you can come back in 
 
 ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary 
 
 and then you can come back in he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after tonks youve got to come back in 
 
 hang on a moment said ron sharply weve forgotten someone 
 
 who asked hermione 
 
 the theyll all be down in the kitchen wont they 
 
 you mean we ought to get them fighting asked harry 
 
 no said ron seriously i mean we should tell them to get out we dont want anymore dobbies do we we cant order them to die for us c 
 
 there was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of hermiones arms running at ron she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted hermione off her feet 
 
 is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here 
 
 ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other 
 
 i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it 
 
 never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just c just hold it in until weve got the diadem 
 
 yeah c right c sorry c said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face 
 
 it was clear as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs that in the minutes that they had spent in the room of requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever dust filled the air and through the nearest window harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the death eaters must be very near to entering the place looking down harry saw grawp the giant meandering past swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure 
 
 lets hope he steps on some of them said ron as more screams echoed from close by 
 
 as long as its not any of our lot said a voice harry turned and saw ginny and tonks both with their wands drawn at the next window which was missing several panes even as he watched ginny sent a jinx into a crowd of fighters below 
 
 good girl roared a figure running through the dust toward them and harry saw aberforth again his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past they look like they might be breaching the north battlements theyve brought giants of their own 
 
 have you seen remus tonks called after him 
 
 he was dueling dolohov shouted aberforth havent seen him since 
 
 tonks said ginny tonks im sure hes okay c 
 
 but tonks had run off into the dust after aberforth 
 
 ginny turned helpless to harry ron and hermione 
 
 theyll be all right said harry though he knew they were empty words ginny well be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe c come on he said to ron and hermione and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the room of requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant 
 
 i need the place where everything is hidden harry begged of it inside his head and the door materialized on their third run past 
 
 the furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them all was silent they were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of students 
 
 and he never realized anyone could get in said ron his voice echoing in the silence 
 
 he thought he was the only one said harry too bad for him ive had to hide stuff in my time this way he added i think its down here 
 
 they sped off up adjacent aisles harry could hear the others footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk of bottles hats crates chairs books weapons broomsticks bats 
 
 somewhere near here harry muttered to himself somewhere somewhere 
 
 deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room his breath was loud in his ears and then his very soul seemed to shiver there it was right ahead the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old potions book and on top of it the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara 
 
 he had already stretched out his hand though he remained few feet away when a voice behind him said hold it potter 
 
 he skidded to a halt and turned around crabbe and goyle were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder wands pointing right at harry through the small space between their jeering faces he saw draco malfoy 
 
 thats my wand youre holding potter said malfoy pointing his own through the gap between crabbe and goyle 
 
 not anymore panted harry tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand winners keepers malfoy whos lent you theirs 
 
 my mother said draco 
 
 harry laughed though there was nothing very humorous about the situation he could not hear ron or hermione anymore they seemed to have run out of earshot searching for the diadem 
 
 so how come you three arent with voldemort asked harry 
 
 were gonna be rewarded said crabbe his voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person harry had hardly ever heard him speak before crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets we ung back potter we decided not to go decided to bring you to im 
 
 good plan said harry in mock admiration he could not believe that he was this close and was going to be thwarted by malfoy crabbe and goyle he began edging slowly backward toward the place where the horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust if he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out 
 
 so how did you get in here he asked trying to distract them 
 
 i virtually lived in the room of hidden things all last year said malfoy his voice brittle i know how to get in 
 
 we was hiding in the corridor outside grunted goyle we can do disslusion charms now and then his face split into a gormless grin you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a whats a 
 
 harry rons voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to harrys right are you talking to someone 
 
 with a whiplike movement crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture of broken trunks of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted descendo 
 
 the wall began to totter then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where ron stood 
 
 ron harry bellowed as somewhere out of sight hermione screamed and harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall he pointed his wand at the rampart cried finite and it steadied 
 
 no shouted malfoy staying crabbes arm as the latter made to repeat his spell if you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing 
 
 whats that matter said crabbe tugging himself free its potter the dark lord wants who cares about a 
 
 potter came in here to get it said malfoy with impatience at the of his colleagues so that must mean c 
 
 must mean crabbe turned on malfoy with undisguised ferocity who cares what you think i dont take your orders no more draco you an your dad are finished 
 
 harry shouted ron again from the other side of the junk wad whats going on 
 
 harry mimicked crabbe whats going on c no potter crucio 
 
 harry had lunged for the tiara crabbes curse missed him but hit the stone bust which flew into the air the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested 
 
 stop malfoy shouted at crabbe his voice echoing through the enormous room the dark lord wants him alive c 
 
 so im not killing him am i yelled crabbe throwing off malfoys restraining arm but if i can i will the dark lord wants him dead anyway whats the diff c 
 
 a jet of scarlet light shot past harry by inches hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a stunning spell straight at crabbes head it only missed because malfoy pulled him out of the way 
 
 its that mudblood avada kedavra 
 
 harry saw hermione dive aside and his fury that crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind he shot a stunning spell at crabbe who lurched out of the way knocking malfoys wand out of his hand it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones 
 
 dont kill him dont kill him malfoy yelled at crabbe and goyle who were both aiming at harry their split seconds hesitation was all harry needed 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 goyles wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him goyle leapt foolishly on the spot trying to retrieve it malfoy jumped out of range of hermiones second stunning spell and ron appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle shot a full curse at crabbe which narrowly missed 
 
 crabbe wheeled around and screamed avada kedavra again ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light the malfoy cowered behind a wardrobe as hermione charged toward them hitting goyle with a stunning spell as she came 
 
 its somewhere here harry yelled at her pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen look for it while i go and help r c 
 
 harry she screamed 
 
 a roaring billowing noise behind him gave him a moments warning he turned and saw both ron and crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them 
 
 like it hot scum roared crabbe as he ran 
 
 but he seemed to have no control over what he had done flames of abnormal size were pursuing them licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks which were crumbling to soot at their touch 
 
 aguamenti harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air 
 
 run 
 
 malfoy grabbed the stunned goyle and dragged him along crabbe outstripped all of them now looking terrified harry ron and hermione pelted along in his wake and the fire pursued them it was not normal fire crabbe had used a curse of which harry had no knowledge as they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive sentient intent upon killing them now the fire was mutating forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts flaming serpents chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths tossed high on clawed feet before being consumed by the inferno 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had vanished from view harry ron and hermione stopped dead the fiery monsters were circling them drawing closer and closer claws and horns and tails lashed and the heat was solid as a wall around them 
 
 what can we do hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire what can we do 
 
 here 
 
 harry seized a pair of broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to ron who pulled hermione onto it behind him harry swung his leg over the second broom and with hard kicks to the ground they soared up in the air missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them the smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room harry could not see a trace of malfoy crabbe or goyle anywhere he swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them but there was nothing but fire what a terrible way to die he had never wanted this 
 
 harry lets get out lets get out bellowed ron though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke 
 
 and then harry heard a thin piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion the thunder of devouring flame 
 
 its c too c dangerous c ron yelled but harry wheeled in the air his glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke he raked the firestorm below seeking a sign of life a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood 
 
 and he saw them malfoy with his arms around the unconscious goyle the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks and harry dived malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm but even as harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good goyle was too heavy and malfoys hand covered in sweat slid instantly out of harrys c 
 
 if we die for them ill kill you harry roared rons voice and as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them he and hermione dragged goyle onto their broom and rose rolling and pitching into the air once more as malfoy clambered up behind harry 
 
 the door get to the door the door screamed malfoy in harrys ear and harry sped up following ron hermione and goyle through the billowing black smoke hardly able to breathe and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration cups and shields a sparkling necklace and an old discolored tiara c 
 
 what are you doing what are you doing the doors that way screamed malfoy but harry made a hairpin swerve and dived the diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist c 
 
 harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him he soared upward and straight toward the place where he prayed the door stood open ron hermione and goyle had vanished malfoy was screaming and holding harry so tightly it hurt then through the smoke harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond 
 
 malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown gasping coughing and retching harry rolled over and sat up the door to the room of requirement had vanished and ron and hermione sat panting on the floor beside goyle who was still unconscious 
 
 choked malfoy as soon as he could speak 
 
 hes dead said ron harshly 
 
 there was silence apart from panting and coughing then a number of huge bangs shook the castle and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms harry staggered to his feet when the headless hunt had passed and looked around the battle was still going on all around him he could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts panic flared within him 
 
 wheres ginny he said sharply she was here she was supposed to be going back into the room of requirement 
 
 blimey dyou reckon itll still work after that fire asked ron but he too got to his feet rubbing his chest and looking left and right shall we split up and look c 
 
 no said hermione getting to her feet too malfoy and goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor neither of them had wands lets stick together i say we go c harry whats that on your arm 
 
 what oh yeah c 
 
 he pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up it was still hot blackened with soot but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure 
 
 a bloodlike substance dark and tarry seemed to be leaking from the diadem suddenly harry felt the thing vibrate violently then break apart in his hands and as it did so he thought he heard the faintest most distant scream of pain echoing not from the grounds or the castle but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers 
 
 it must have been fiendfyre whimpered hermione her eyes on the broken piece 
 
 sorry 
 
 fiendfyre c cursed fire c its one of the substances that destroy horcruxes but i would never ever have dared use it its so dangerous c how did crabbe know how to c 
 
 mustve learned from the carrows said harry grimly 
 
 shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really said ron whose hair like hermiones was singed and whose face was blackened if he hadnt tried to kill us all id be quite sorry he was dead 
 
 but dont you realize whispered hermione this means if we can just get the snake c 
 
 but she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail death eaters had penetrated hogwarts fred and percy had just backed into view both of them dueling masked and hooded men 
 
 harry ron and hermione ran forward to help jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling percy backed off fast then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair c 
 
 hello minister bellowed percy sending a neat jinx straight at thicknesse who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes apparently in awful discomfort did i mention im resigning 
 
 youre joking perce shouted fred as the death eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin fred looked at percy with glee 
 
 you actually are joking perce i dont think ive heard you joke since you were c 
 
 the air exploded they had been grouped together harry ron hermione fred and percy the two death eaters at their feet one stunned the other transfigured and in that fragment of a moment when danger seemed temporarily at bay the world was rent apart harry felt himself flying through the air and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon and shield his head in his arms he heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them c 
 
 and then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness he was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause and he stood up swaying more frightened than he had been that day more frightened perhaps than he had been in his life 
 
 and hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart harry grabbed hermiones hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood 
 
 no c no c no someone was shouting no fred no and percy was shaking his brother and ron was kneeling beside them and freds eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face

 whenever a good child dies an angel of god comes down from 
 heaven takes the dead child in his arms spreads out his great 
 white wings and flies with him over all the places which the child 
 had loved during his life then he gathers a large handful of flowers 
 which he carries up to the almighty that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth and the almighty presses the flowers to his heart but he kisses the flower that pleases him 
 best and it receives a voice and is able to join the song of the 
 chorus of bliss 
 
 these words were spoken by an angel of god as he carried a dead 
 child up to heaven and the child listened as if in a dream then they 
 passed over spots where the little one had often played 
 and through beautiful gardens full of lovely flowers 
 
 which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplanted 
 there asked the angel 
 
 close by grew a slender beautiful but some wicked 
 hand had broken the stem and the rosebuds hung faded 
 and withered on the trailing branches 
 
 poor said the child let us take it with us to 
 heaven that it may bloom above in garden 
 
 the angel took up the then he kissed the child and the 
 little one half opened his eyes the angel gathered also some 
 beautiful flowers as well as a few humble buttercups and 
 
 
 now we have flowers enough said the child but the angel only 
 nodded he did not fly upward to heaven 
 
 it was night and quite still in the great town here they 
 remained and the angel hovered over a small narrow street in 
 which lay a large heap of straw ashes and sweepings from the 
 houses of people who had removed there lay fragments of plates 
 pieces of plaster rags old hats and other rubbish not pleasant to 
 see amidst all this confusion the angel pointed to the pieces of a 
 broken and to a lump of earth which had fallen out of 
 it the earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots of a 
 withered which had been thrown amongst the rubbish 
 
 we will take this with us said the angel i will tell you why as we fly along 
 
 and as they flew the angel related the history 
 
 down in that narrow lane in a low cellar lived a poor sick boy 
 he had been afflicted from his childhood and even in his best days he 
 could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice but no more during some days in summer the sunbeams would lie on the floor of the cellar for about half an hour in this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine and 
 watching the red blood through his delicate fingers as he held them 
 before his face then he would say he had been out yet he knew 
 nothing of the green forest in its spring verdure till a 
 son brought him a green bough from a this he would place over his head and fancy that he was in the while the sun shone and the birds carolled gayly one spring day the boy brought him some and among them was one to which the root still adhered this he carefully planted in a and placed in a near his bed and the flower had been planted by a fortunate hand for it grew put forth fresh shoots and blossomed every year it became a splendid to the sick boy and his little treasure upon earth he watered it and cherished it and took care it should have the benefit of every 
 sunbeam that found its way into the cellar from the earliest 
 morning ray to the evening sunset the flower entwined itself even 
 in his dreams for him it bloomed for him spread its perfume and 
 it gladdened his eyes and to the flower he turned even in death 
 when the lord called him he has been one year with god during that time the flower has stood in the window withered and forgotten 
 till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street on the 
 day of the lodgers removal and this poor flower withered and 
 faded as it is we have added to our nosegay because it gave more 
 real joy than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a queen 
 but how do you know all this asked the child whom the angel was 
 carrying to heaven 
 
 i know it said the angel because i myself was the poor sick 
 boy who walked upon crutches and i know my own flower well 
 then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious 
 happy face of the angel and at the same moment they found 
 themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy and 
 god pressed the dead child to his heart and wings were given him so that he could fly with the angel hand in hand then the almighty 
 pressed all the flowers to his heart but he kissed the withered 
 and it received a voice then it joined in the song of 
 the angels who surrounded the throne some near and others in a 
 distant circle but all equally happy they all joined in the chorus 
 of praise both great and small the good happy child and the 
 poor that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of 
 rubbish in a narrow dark street

 jean valjean takes his revenge 
 when jean valjean was left alone with javert he untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body and the knot of which was under the table 
 after this he made him a sign to rise 
 javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of enchained authority is condensed 
 jean valjean took javert by the martingale as one would take a beast of burden by the and dragging the latter after him emerged from the slowly because javert with his impeded limbs could take only very short steps 
 jean valjean had the pistol in his hand 
 in this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade the insurgents all intent on the attack which was imminent had their backs turned to these two 
 marius alone stationed on one side at the extreme left of the barricade saw them pass 
 this group of victim and executioner was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul 
 jean valjean with some difficulty but without relaxing his hold for a single instant made javert pinioned as he was scale the little entrenchment in the mondetour lane 
 when they had crossed this barrier they found themselves alone in the lane 
 no one saw them 
 among the heap they could distinguish a livid face streaming hair a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a woman 
 it was eponine 
 the corner of the houses hid them from the insurgents 
 the corpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant 
 javert gazed askance at this body and profoundly calm said in a low tone 
 it strikes me that i know that girl 
 then he turned to jean valjean 
 jean valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on javert a look which it required no words to interpret 
 javert it is i 
 javert replied 
 take your revenge 
 jean valjean drew from his pocket a knife and opened it 
 a exclaimed javert you are right 
 that suits you better 
 jean valjean cut the martingale which javert had about his neck then he cut the cords on his wrists then stooping down he cut the cord on his feet and straightening himself up he said to him 
 you are free 
 javert was not easily astonished 
 still master of himself though he was he could not repress a start 
 he remained and motionless 
 jean valjean continued 
 i do not think that i shall escape from this place 
 but if by chance i do i live under the name of fauchelevent in the rue de arme no 
 javert snarled like a tiger which made him half open one corner of his mouth and he muttered between his teeth 
 have a care 
 go said jean valjean 
 javert began again 
 thou saidst fauchelevent rue de arme 
 number 
 javert repeated in a low 
 he buttoned up his coat once more resumed the military stiffness between his shoulders made a half turn folded his arms and supporting his chin on one of his hands he set out in the direction of the halles 
 jean valjean followed him with his eyes 
 a few minutes later javert turned round and shouted to jean valjean 
 you annoy me 
 kill me rather 
 javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed jean valjean as thou 
 be off with you said jean valjean 
 javert retreated slowly 
 a moment later he turned the corner of the rue des precheurs 
 when javert had disappeared jean valjean fired his pistol in the air 
 then he returned to the barricade and said 
 it is done 
 in the meanwhile this is what had taken place 
 marius more intent on the outside than on the interior had not up to that time taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the 
 when he beheld him in broad daylight striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death he recognized him something suddenly recurred to his mind 
 he recalled the inspector of the rue de pontoise and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he marius had used in this very barricade and not only did he recall his face but his name as well 
 this recollection was misty and troubled however like all his ideas 
 it was not an affirmation that he made but a question which he put to himself 
 is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert 
 perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man but in the first place he must know whether this was javert 
 marius called to enjolras who had just stationed himself at the other extremity of the barricade 
 enjolras 
 what 
 what is the name of yonder man 
 what man 
 the police agent 
 do you know his name 
 of course 
 he told us 
 what is it 
 javert 
 marius sprang to his feet

 jean valjean and cried 
 it is done 
 a gloomy chill traversed marius heart

 chapter iii 
 
 princess mary postponed her departure sonya and the count tried to replace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natasha remained constantly at her side sleeping on a lounge chair in her room making her eat and drink and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed her mother 
 the wounded spirit could not could not heal death had torn from her half her life when the news of death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life but the same blow that almost killed the countess this second blow restored natasha to life 
 a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within 
 wound healed in that way she thought her life was ended but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life love was still active within her love awoke and so did life 
 prince last days had bound princess mary and natasha together this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess mary put off her departure and for three weeks looked after natasha as if she had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her bedroom had strained physical strength 
 one afternoon noticing natasha shivering with fever princess mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natasha lay down but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back 
 i want to sleep mary sit by me a little 
 you are tired try to sleep 
 no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me 
 she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary 
 natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned princess face 
 is she like him thought natasha yes like and yet not like but she is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me what is in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind like what does she think about me yes she is splendid 
 mary she said timidly drawing princess hand to herself mary you think me wicked no mary darling how i love you let us be quite quite friends 
 and natasha embracing her began kissing her face and hands making princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings 
 from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between princess mary and natasha they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together when one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each presence 
 sometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning they spoke most of what was long past princess mary spoke of her childhood of her mother her father and her daydreams and natasha who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion submission and the poetry of christian now feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her she did not think of applying submission and to her own life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues for princess mary listening to tales of childhood and early youth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life belief in life and its enjoyment 
 just as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they thought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it 
 natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health and this pleased her but sometimes she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weakness and loss of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed her drawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed to her that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sad 
 one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down and then testing her strength ran upstairs again observing the result 
 another time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled so she called again though she could hear dunyasha coming called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing sing and listened attentively to herself 
 she did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound had begun to heal from within 
 at the end of january princess mary left for moscow and the count insisted on going with her to consult the doctors

 book war between four walls 
 chapter xx 
 
 the dead are in the right and the living are not in the wrong 
 the death agony of the barricade was about to begin 
 everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment a thousand mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the march the firing by squads and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs indescribable and vaguely terrible cries lightnings of menace everywhere the tocsin of which now had the accents of a sob the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the houses 
 for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue de la chanvrerie had become two walls ferocious walls doors closed windows closed shutters closed 
 in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour was come when the people wished to put an end to a situation which had lasted too long with a charter granted or with a legal country when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear then the inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt so to speak was the auxiliary of the combatant and the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested on it 
 when the situation was not ripe when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted when the masses disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuges were nailed up and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade 
 a people cannot be forced through surprise to walk more quickly than it chooses 
 woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand 
 a people does not let itself go at random 
 then it abandons the insurrection to itself 
 the insurgents become noxious infected with the plague a house is an escarpment a door is a refusal a facade is a wall this wall hears sees and will not 
 it might open and save you no this wall is a judge 
 it gazes at you and condemns you what dismal things are closed houses 
 they seem dead they are living life which is as it were suspended there persists there no one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours but no one is missing from them 
 in the interior of that rock people go and come go to bed and rise again they are a family party there there they eat and drink they are afraid a terrible thing fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality terror is mixed with it an extenuating circumstance 
 sometimes even and this has been actually seen fear turns to passion fright may change into fury as prudence does into rage hence this wise saying the enraged moderates 
 there are outbursts of supreme terror whence springs wrath like a mournful do these people want what have they come there to do 
 let them get out of the scrape so much the worse for them 
 it is their fault 
 they are only getting what they deserve 
 it does not concern us 
 here is our poor street all riddled with balls 
 they are a pack of rascals 
 above all things open the the house assumes the air of a tomb the insurgent is in the in front of that house he sees the and naked swords drawing near if he cries he knows that they are listening to him and that no one will come there stand walls which might protect him there are men who might save him and these walls have ears of flesh and these men have bowels of stone 
 whom shall he reproach 
 no one and every one 
 the incomplete times in which we live 
 it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and from minerva turns to pallas 
 the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits it it almost always comes too soon 
 then it becomes resigned and stoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph 
 it serves those who deny it without complaint even excusing them and even disculpates them and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment it is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude 
 is this ingratitude however 
 yes from the point of view of the human race

 book war between four walls 
 chapter xx 
 
 the dead are in the right and the living are not in the wrong 
 the death agony of the barricade was about to begin 
 everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment a thousand mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the march the firing by squads and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs indescribable and vaguely terrible cries lightnings of menace everywhere the tocsin of which now had the accents of a sob the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the houses 
 for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue de la chanvrerie had become two walls ferocious walls doors closed windows closed shutters closed 
 in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour was come when the people wished to put an end to a situation which had lasted too long with a charter granted or with a legal country when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear then the inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt so to speak was the auxiliary of the combatant and the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested on it 
 when the situation was not ripe when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted when the masses disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuges were nailed up and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade 
 a people cannot be forced through surprise to walk more quickly than it chooses 
 woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand 
 a people does not let itself go at random 
 then it abandons the insurrection to itself 
 the insurgents become noxious infected with the plague a house is an escarpment a door is a refusal a facade is a wall this wall hears sees and will not 
 it might open and save you no this wall is a judge 
 it gazes at you and condemns you what dismal things are closed houses 
 they seem dead they are living life which is as it were suspended there persists there no one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours but no one is missing from them 
 in the interior of that rock people go and come go to bed and rise again they are a family party there there they eat and drink they are afraid a terrible thing fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality terror is mixed with it an extenuating circumstance 
 sometimes even and this has been actually seen fear turns to passion fright may change into fury as prudence does into rage hence this wise saying the enraged moderates 
 there are outbursts of supreme terror whence springs wrath like a mournful do these people want what have they come there to do 
 let them get out of the scrape so much the worse for them 
 it is their fault 
 they are only getting what they deserve 
 it does not concern us 
 here is our poor street all riddled with balls 
 they are a pack of rascals 
 above all things open the the house assumes the air of a tomb the insurgent is in the in front of that house he sees the and naked swords drawing near if he cries he knows that they are listening to him and that no one will come there stand walls which might protect him there are men who might save him and these walls have ears of flesh and these men have bowels of stone 
 whom shall he reproach 
 no one and every one 
 the incomplete times in which we live 
 it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and from minerva turns to pallas 
 the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits it it almost always comes too soon 
 then it becomes resigned and stoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph 
 it serves those who deny it without complaint even excusing them and even disculpates them and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment it is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude 
 is this ingratitude however 
 yes from the point of view of the human race 
 no from the point of view of the individual 
 progress is mode of existence 
 the general life of the human race is called progress the collective stride of the human race is called progress 
 progress advances it makes the great human and terrestrial journey towards the celestial and the divine it has its halting places where it rallies the laggard troop it has its stations where it meditates in the presence of some splendid canaan suddenly unveiled on its horizon it has its nights when it sleeps and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the human soul and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awaken that slumbering progress

 book fifteen 
 chapter iv 
 
 after the encounter at vyazma where kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the russians who pursued them continued as far as krasnoe without a battle the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable 
 the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of miles a day that they could not go any faster 
 to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand 
 the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was that the russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own people the chief cause of the wastage of army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army 
 kutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian army generals directed his whole activity here as he had done at tarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army 
 but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road the french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches to that end activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilna not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it 
 kutuzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being what every russian soldier felt that the french were beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year 
 but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers insufficiently clad and half starved who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier 
 this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army

 after the encounter at vyazma where kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the russians who pursued them continued as far as krasnoe without a battle the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable 
 the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of miles a day that they could not go any faster 
 to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand 
 the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was that the russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own people the chief cause of the wastage of army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army 
 kutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian army generals directed his whole activity here as he had done at tarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army 
 but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road the french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches to that end activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilna not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it 
 kutuzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being what every russian soldier felt that the french were beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year 
 but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers insufficiently clad and half starved who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier 
 this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army 
 so it was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the three french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men despite all efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob of french soldiers by russians continued at krasnoe for three days 
 toll wrote a disposition the first column will march to so and so etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition prince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds that were running past and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night making their way round as best they could and continued their flight

 on the evening before in the darkness the barricade had been approached silently as by a boa 
 now in broad daylight in that widening street surprise was decidedly impossible rude force had moreover been unmasked the cannon had begun the roar the army hurled itself on the barricade 
 fury now became skill a powerful detachment of infantry of the line broken at regular intervals by the national guard and the municipal guard on foot and supported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen debauched into the street at a run with drums beating trumpets braying bayonets levelled the sappers at their head and imperturbable under the projectiles charged straight for the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall

 the assault was so furious that for one moment it was inundated with assailants but it shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam to a moment later beetling black and formidable

 in and kutuzov was openly accused of blundering the emperor was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order of the highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning court liar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by his blunders at krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory of complete victory over the french 
 history of the year the character of kutuzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe by bogdanovich 
 such is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian mind does not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individuals who discerning the will of providence submit their personal will to it the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the higher laws 
 for russian historians strange and terrible to say napoleon that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showed human dignity napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he is grand but kutuzov the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in never once swerving by word or deed from borodino to vilna presented an example exceptional in history of and a present conciousness of the future importance of what was happening kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and when speaking of him and of the year they always seem a little ashamed 
 and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all efforts were directed in 
 kutuzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from the pyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he said nothing about himself adopted no prose always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and most ordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de stael read novels liked the society of pretty women jested with generals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him when count rostopchin at the yauza bridge galloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle kutuzov replied and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle though moscow was then already abandoned when arakcheev coming to him from the emperor said that ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery kutuzov replied yes i was just saying so myself though a moment before he had said quite the contrary what did it matter to him who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening what did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the calamities of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery 
 not merely in these cases but continually did that old man who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head 
 but that man so heedless of his words did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite of himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodino from which time his disagreement with those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodino was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia in reply to proposal of peace he said there can be no peace for such is the will he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neither the tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen 
 and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev to please the emperor he alone incurring thereby the displeasure said in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful 
 nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed to one and the same threefold end to brace all his strength for conflict with the french to defeat them and to drive them out of russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army 
 this procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time this enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov who before the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone in contradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodino was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles which were useless then should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia crossed 
 it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and results now lie before us 
 but how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinion so truly discern the importance of the view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it 
 the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength 
 only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner contrary to the wish to select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he the commander in chief devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them 
 that simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be cast in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that history has invented 
 to a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception of greatness

 but that man so heedless of his words did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite of himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodino from which time his disagreement with those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodino was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia in reply to proposal of peace he said there can be no peace for such is the will he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neither the tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen 
 and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev to please the emperor he alone incurring thereby the displeasure said in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful 
 nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed to one and the same threefold end to brace all his strength for conflict with the french to defeat them and to drive them out of russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army 
 this procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time this enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov who before the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone in contradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodino was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles which were useless then should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia crossed 
 it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and results now lie before us 
 but how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinion so truly discern the importance of the view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it 
 the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength 
 only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner contrary to the wish to select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he the commander in chief devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them 
 that simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be cast in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that history has invented 
 to a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception of greatness

 when there were no longer any of the leaders left alive except enjolras and marius at the two extremities of the barricade the centre which had so long sustained courfeyrac joly bossuet feuilly and combeferre gave way 
 the cannon though it had not effected a practicable breach had made a rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt there the summit of the wall had disappeared before the balls and had crumbled away and the rubbish which had fallen now inside now outside had as it accumulated formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two sides of the barrier one on the inside the other on the outside the exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack 
 a final assault was there attempted and this assault succeeded the mass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run came up with irresistible force and the serried front of battle of the attacking column made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the battlements 
 this time it was decisive the group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated in confusion 
 then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them many finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns did not wish to die 
 this is a moment when the instinct of emits howls when the beast in men they were hemmed in by the lofty house which formed the background of their redoubt 
 this house might prove their salvation the building was barricaded and walled as it were from top to bottom before the troops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt there was time for a door to open and shut the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for that and the door of that house suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly was life for these despairing men 
 behind this house there were streets possible flight space 
 they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns and with kicks shouting calling entreating wringing their hands 
 no one opened 
 from the little window on the third floor the head of the dead man gazed down upon them 
 but enjolras and marius and the seven or eight rallied about them sprang forward and protected them 
 enjolras had shouted to the soldiers 
 advance and as an officer had not obeyed enjolras had killed the officer 
 he was now in the little inner court of the redoubt with his back planted against the corinthe building a sword in one hand a rifle in the other holding open the door of the which he barred against assailants 
 he shouted to the desperate is but one door open this one and shielding them with his body and facing an entire battalion alone he made them pass in behind him 
 all precipitated themselves thither enjolras executing with his rifle which he now used like a cane what players call a covered rose round his head levelled the bayonets around and in front of him and was the last to enter and then ensued a horrible moment when the soldiers tried to make their way in and the insurgents strove to bar them out the door was slammed with such violence that as it fell back into its frame it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to it cut off and glued to the post 
 marius remained outside 
 a shot had just broken his collar bone he felt that he was fainting and falling 
 at that moment with eyes already shut he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him and the swoon in which his senses vanished hardly allowed him time for the thought mingled with a last memory of am taken prisoner 
 i shall be shot 
 enjolras not seeing marius among those who had taken refuge in the had the same idea 
 but they had reached a moment when each man has not the time to meditate on his own death enjolras fixed the bar across the door and bolted it and it with key and chain while those outside were battering furiously at it the soldiers with the butts of their muskets the sappers with their axes 
 the assailants were grouped about that door the siege of the was now beginning 
 the soldiers we will observe were full of wrath 
 the death of the had enraged them and then a still more melancholy circumstance 
 during the few hours which had preceded the attack it had been reported among them that the insurgents were mutilating their prisoners and that there was the headless body of a soldier in the this sort of fatal rumor is the usual accompaniment of civil wars and it was a false report of this kind which later on produced the catastrophe of the rue transnonain 
 when the door was barricaded enjolras said to the others 
 let us sell our lives dearly 
 then he approached the table on which lay mabeuf and gavroche beneath the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible one large the other small and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold folds of the shroud 
 a hand projected from beneath the winding sheet and hung near the floor 
 it was that of the old man 
 enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand just as he had kissed his brow on the preceding evening 
 these were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of his life 
 let us abridge the tale 
 the barricade had fought like a gate of thebes the fought like a house of saragossa these resistances are dogged 
 no quarter 
 no flag of truce possible men are willing to die provided their opponent will kill them 
 when suchet replies

 they were bottles of aquafortis 
 we relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred the besieged man alas converts everything into a weapon

 the rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain whence dripped long red and smoking streams the uproar was indescribable a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch there were no longer men in this conflict which was now infernal they were no longer giants matched with colossi 
 it resembled milton and dante rather than homer 
 demons attacked spectres resisted 
 it was heroism become monstrous

 the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of krasnoe toward evening after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred 
 the day was clear and frosty kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump little white horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups of french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them were crowding to warm themselves at campfires near dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed french guns at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on kutuzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on his white horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured 
 kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a specially wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by noses and cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyes 
 one group of the french stood close to the road and two of them one of whom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands there was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which after a glance at kutuzov the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing 
 kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered his face screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head at another spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the shoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutuzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head 
 what were you saying he asked the general who continuing his report directed the commander in attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment 
 ah the standards said kutuzov evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him 
 he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him 
 he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply and closed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head and began to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he looked attentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several of them 
 i thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again the officers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard i thank you all for your hard and faithful service the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to you forever 
 he paused and looked around 
 lower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk standards lower lower it hurrah lads he added addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin 
 roared thousands of voices 
 while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam 
 you see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important 
 there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say 
 you see brothers i know hard for you but it be helped bear up it be for long now see our visitors off and then rest the tsar forget your service it is hard for you but still you are at home while they you see what they have come to said he pointing to the prisoners worse off than our poorest beggars while they were strong we spare ourselves but now we may even pity them they are human beings too it so lads 
 he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said his face grew brighter and brighter with an old mild smile which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity 
 but after all who asked them here serves them right the bloody bastards he cried suddenly lifting his head 
 and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting hurrah 
 words were hardly understood by the troops no one could have repeated the field address begun solemnly and then changing into an old simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of that speech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by that old expletives was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and shouts afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly moved

 book war between four walls 
 chapter xxiii 
 
 orestes fasting and pylades drunk 
 at length by dint of mounting on each backs aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase climbing up the walls clinging to the ceiling slashing away at the very brink of the the last one who offered resistance a score of assailants soldiers national guardsmen municipal guardsmen in utter confusion the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent blinded by blood furious rendered savage made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor 
 there they found only one man still on his feet enjolras 
 without cartridges without sword he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering he had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself he had retreated into the corner of the room and there with haughty eye and head borne high with this stump of a weapon in his hand he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him 
 a cry arose 
 he is the leader 
 it was he who slew the it is well that he has placed himself there 
 let him remain there let us shoot him down on the spot 
 shoot me said enjolras 
 and flinging away his bit of and folding his arms he offered his breast 
 the audacity of a fine death always affects men 
 as soon as enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end the din of strife ceased in the room and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity 
 the menacing majesty of enjolras disarmed and motionless appeared to oppress this tumult and this young man haughty bloody and charming who alone had not a wound who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being seemed by the authority of his tranquil glance to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully 
 his beauty at that moment augmented by his pride was resplendent and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded 
 it was of him possibly that a witness spoke afterwards before the council of war 
 there was an insurgent whom i heard called apollo a national guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras lowered his gun saying 
 it seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower 
 twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras and silently made ready their guns 
 then a sergeant shouted 
 take aim 
 an officer intervened 
 wait 
 and addressing enjolras 
 do you wish to have your eyes bandaged 
 no 
 was it you who killed the artillery sergeant 
 yes 
 grantaire had waked up a few moments before 
 grantaire it will be remembered had been asleep ever since the preceding evening in the upper room of the seated on a chair and leaning on the table 
 he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk the hideous potion of and alcohol had thrown him into a lethargy 
 his table being small and not suitable for the barricade he had been left in possession of it he was still in the same posture with his breast bent over the table his head lying flat on his arms surrounded by glasses and bottles 
 his was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech 
 nothing had had any effect upon it neither the fusillade nor the nor the which had made its way through the window into the room where he was nor the tremendous uproar of the assault 
 he merely replied to the cannonade now and then by a snore 
 he seemed to be waiting there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking many corpses were strewn around him and at the first glance there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers of death 
 noise does not rouse a drunken man silence awakens him 
 the fall of everything around him only augmented prostration the crumbling of all things was his lullaby 
 the sort of halt which the tumult underwent in the presence of enjolras was a shock to this heavy slumber 
 it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed which suddenly comes to a dead stop 
 the persons dozing within it wake up 
 grantaire rose to his feet with a start stretched out his arms rubbed his eyes stared yawned and understood 
 a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away 
 one beholds at a single glance and as a whole all that it has concealed 
 all suddenly presents itself to the memory and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last hours has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed 
 ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity the obliteration of intoxication a sort of steam which has obscured the brain is dissipated and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities 
 relegated as he was to one corner and sheltered behind the the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on enjolras had not even noticed grantaire and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order 
 take aim when all at once they heard a strong voice shout beside them 
 long live the republic 
 one of them 
 grantaire had risen 
 the immense gleam of the whole combat which he had missed and in which he had had no part appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man 
 he repeated 
 long live the republic crossed the room with a firm stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside enjolras 
 finish both of us at one blow said he 
 and turning gently to enjolras he said to him 
 do you permit it 
 enjolras pressed his hand with a smile 
 this smile was not ended when the report resounded 
 enjolras pierced by eight bullets remained leaning against the wall as though the balls had nailed him there 
 only his head was bowed 
 grantaire fell at his feet as though struck by a thunderbolt 
 a few moments later the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents who had taken refuge at the top of the house 
 they fired into the attic through a wooden lattice

 orestes fasting and pylades drunk 
 at length by dint of mounting on each backs aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase climbing up the walls clinging to the ceiling slashing away at the very brink of the the last one who offered resistance a score of assailants soldiers national guardsmen municipal guardsmen in utter confusion the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent blinded by blood furious rendered savage made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor 
 there they found only one man still on his feet enjolras 
 without cartridges without sword he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering he had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself he had retreated into the corner of the room and there with haughty eye and head borne high with this stump of a weapon in his hand he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him 
 a cry arose 
 he is the leader 
 it was he who slew the it is well that he has placed himself there 
 let him remain there let us shoot him down on the spot 
 shoot me said enjolras 
 and flinging away his bit of and folding his arms he offered his breast 
 the audacity of a fine death always affects men 
 as soon as enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end the din of strife ceased in the room and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity 
 the menacing majesty of enjolras disarmed and motionless appeared to oppress this tumult and this young man haughty bloody and charming who alone had not a wound who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being seemed by the authority of his tranquil glance to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully 
 his beauty at that moment augmented by his pride was resplendent and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded 
 it was of him possibly that a witness spoke afterwards before the council of war 
 there was an insurgent whom i heard called apollo a national guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras lowered his gun saying 
 it seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower 
 twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras and silently made ready their guns 
 then a sergeant shouted 
 take aim 
 an officer intervened 
 wait 
 and addressing enjolras 
 do you wish to have your eyes bandaged 
 no 
 was it you who killed the artillery sergeant 
 yes 
 grantaire had waked up a few moments before 
 grantaire it will be remembered had been asleep ever since the preceding evening in the upper room of the seated on a chair and leaning on the table 
 he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk the hideous potion of and alcohol had thrown him into a lethargy 
 his table being small and not suitable for the barricade he had been left in possession of it he was still in the same posture with his breast bent over the table his head lying flat on his arms surrounded by glasses and bottles 
 his was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech 
 nothing had had any effect upon it neither the fusillade nor the nor the which had made its way through the window into the room where he was nor the tremendous uproar of the assault 
 he merely replied to the cannonade now and then by a snore 
 he seemed to be waiting there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking many corpses were strewn around him and at the first glance there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers of death 
 noise does not rouse a drunken man silence awakens him 
 the fall of everything around him only augmented prostration the crumbling of all things was his lullaby 
 the sort of halt which the tumult underwent in the presence of enjolras was a shock to this heavy slumber 
 it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed which suddenly comes to a dead stop 
 the persons dozing within it wake up 
 grantaire rose to his feet with a start stretched out his arms rubbed his eyes stared yawned and understood 
 a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away 
 one beholds at a single glance and as a whole all that it has concealed 
 all suddenly presents itself to the memory and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last hours has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed 
 ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity the obliteration of intoxication a sort of steam which has obscured the brain is dissipated and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities 
 relegated as he was to one corner and sheltered behind the the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on enjolras had not even noticed grantaire and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order 
 take aim when all at once they heard a strong voice shout beside them 
 long live the republic 
 one of them 
 grantaire had risen 
 the immense gleam of the whole combat which he had missed and in which he had had no part appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man 
 he repeated 
 long live the republic crossed the room with a firm stride and placed himself in front of the guns beside enjolras 
 finish both of us at one blow said he 
 and turning gently to enjolras he said to him 
 do you permit it 
 enjolras pressed his hand with a smile 
 this smile was not ended when the report resounded 
 enjolras pierced by eight bullets remained leaning against the wall as though the balls had nailed him there 
 only his head was bowed 
 grantaire fell at his feet as though struck by a thunderbolt 
 a few moments later the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents who had taken refuge at the top of the house 
 they fired into the attic through a wooden lattice 
 they fought under the very roof they flung bodies some of them still alive out through the windows two who tried to lift the shattered omnibus were slain by two shots fired from the attic 
 a man in a blouse was flung down from it with a bayonet wound in the abdomen and breathed his last on the ground 
 a soldier and an insurgent slipped together on the sloping slates of the roof and as they would not release each other they fell clasped in a ferocious embrace 
 a similar conflict went on in the cellar 
 shouts shots a fierce trampling then silence 
 the barricade was captured 
 the soldiers began to search the houses round about and to pursue the fugitives

 when the troops reached their halting place on the eighth of november the last day of the krasnoe battles it was already growing dusk all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear through the falling snow a and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener 
 an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place a village on the highroad the quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead frenchmen cavalrymen and members of the staff there was only one hut available for the regimental commander 
 the commander rode up to his hut the regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts 
 like some huge animal the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food one part of it dispersed and waded through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village and immediately the sound of axes and swords the crashing of branches and merry voices could be heard from there another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit and feeding the horses a third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts and dragging away boards dry wood and thatch from the roofs for the campfires or wattle fences to serve for shelter 
 some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed the roof of which had already been removed 
 now then all together shove cried the voices and the huge surface of the wall sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost was seen swaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had been pushing it loud coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued 
 now then catch hold in twos hand up the lever it where are you shoving to 
 now all together but wait a moment boys with a song 
 all stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety voice began to sing at the end of the third verse as the last note died away twenty voices roared out at once it all together heave away boys but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible 
 here you of the sixth company devils that you are lend a hand will you you may want us one of these days 
 some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into the village joined the haulers and the wattle wall which was about feet long an seven feet high moved forward along the village street swaying pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping men 
 get along falling what are you stopping for there now 
 merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely 
 what are you up to suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden there are gentry here the general himself is in that hut and you devils you brutes give it to you shouted he hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back you make less noise 
 the men became silent the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle 
 there how that devil hits out made my face all bloody said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on 
 you like it said a laughing voice and moderating their tones the men moved forward 
 when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives 
 in the hut which the men had passed the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a flank march to the left cut off the murat and capture him

 marius was in fact a prisoner 
 the hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of jean valjean 
 jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose himself in it 
 had it not been for him no one in that supreme phase of agony would have thought of the wounded 
 thanks to him everywhere present in the carnage like a providence those who fell were picked up transported to the and cared for in the intervals he reappeared on the barricade 
 but nothing which could resemble a blow an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands 
 he held his peace and lent succor moreover he had received only a few scratches 
 the bullets would have none of him 
 if suicide formed part of what he had meditated on coming to this sepulchre to that spot he had not succeeded but we doubt whether he had thought of suicide an irreligious act 
 jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see marius the truth is that he never took his eyes from the latter when a shot laid marius low jean valjean leaped forward with the agility of a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off 
 the whirlwind of the attack was at that moment so violently concentrated upon enjolras and upon the door of the that no one saw jean valjean sustaining the fainting marius in his arms traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the corinthe building 
 the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street it afforded shelter from the bullets the and all eyes and a few square feet of space 
 there is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration and in the midst of raging seas beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals a tranquil nook 
 it was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade that eponine had breathed her last 
 there jean valjean halted let marius slide to the ground placed his back against the wall and cast his eyes about him 
 the situation was alarming 
 for an instant for two or three perhaps this bit of wall was a shelter but how was he to escape from this massacre 
 he recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the rue polonceau eight years before and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape it was difficult then it was impossible 
 he had before him that deaf and implacable house six stories in height which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window he had on his right the rather low barricade which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie to pass this obstacle seemed easy but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible the troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade it was evident that to pass the barricade was to go in quest of the fire of the platoon and that any head which should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve as a target for sixty shots 
 on his left he had the field of battle death lurked round the corner of that wall 
 what was to be done 
 only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament 
 and it was necessary to decide on the instant to devise some expedient to come to some decision 
 fighting was going on a few paces away fortunately all were raging around a single point the door of the but if it should occur to one soldier to one single soldier to turn the corner of the house or to attack him on the flank all was over 
 jean valjean gazed at the house facing him he gazed at the barricade at one side of him then he looked at the ground with the violence of the last extremity bewildered and as though he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes 
 by dint of staring something vaguely striking in such an agony began to assume form and outline at his feet as though it had been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold a few paces distant he perceived at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and watched on the exterior beneath a disordered mass of which partly concealed it an iron grating placed flat and on a level with the soil 
 this grating made of stout transverse bars was about two feet square the frame of which supported it had been torn up and it was as it were unfastened 
 through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture something like the flue of a chimney or the pipe of a cistern jean valjean darted forward 
 his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination 
 to thrust aside the stones to raise the grating to lift marius who was as inert as a dead body upon his shoulders to descend with this burden on his loins and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort of well fortunately not very deep to let the heavy trap upon which the loosened stones rolled down afresh fall into its place behind him to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the this was executed like that which one does in dreams with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle this took only a few minutes 
 jean valjean found himself with marius who was still unconscious in a sort of long subterranean corridor 
 there reigned profound peace absolute silence night 
 the impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the wall into the convent recurred to him 
 only what he was carrying was not cosette it was marius

 one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched conditions the russian soldiers were in at that time lacking warm boots and sheepskin coats without a roof over their heads in the snow with eighteen degrees of frost and without even full rations the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops they would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle 
 on the contrary the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army day by day all the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army physically and mentally remained 
 more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than anywhere else two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others for leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel 
 eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you lost or have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wood shouted a and man screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire and you jackdaw go and fetch some wood said he to another soldier 
 this man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they called jackdaw a thin little fellow with a sharp nose rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood 
 bring it here fine 
 they split up the wood pressed it down on the fire blew at it with their mouths and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats making the flames hiss and crackle the men drew nearer and lit their pipes the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood setting his arms akimbo began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood 
 mother the dew is cold but clear well that a musketeer he sang pretending to hiccough after each syllable 
 look out your soles will fly off shouted the man noticing that the sole of the boot was hanging loose what a fellow you are for dancing 
 the dancer stopped pulled off the loose piece of leather and threw it on the fire 
 right enough friend said he and having sat down took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his foot the steam that spoils them he added stretching out his feet toward the fire 
 soon be issuing us new ones they say that when finished hammering them to receive double kits 
 and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it seems said one sergeant major 
 had an eye on him this long while said the other 
 well a poor sort of soldier 
 but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday 
 yes all very well but when a feet are frozen how can he walk 
 eh talk nonsense said a sergeant major 
 do you want to be doing the same said an old soldier turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet 
 well you know said the man they called jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the fire a plump man gets thin but for a thin one death take me now got no strength left he added with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital aching all over anyway i be able to keep up 
 do do replied the sergeant major quietly 
 the soldier said no more and the talk went on 
 what a lot of those frenchies were taken today and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on said a soldier starting a new theme they were no more than 
 the cossacks have taken their boots they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in the dancer as they turned them over one seemed still alive and would you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo 
 but a clean folk lads the first man went on he was white as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows you might think they were nobles 
 well what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there 
 but they understand our talk at all said the dancer with a puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in his own way a queer lot 
 but strange friends continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well those dead had been lying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as white as paper clean and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke 
 was it from the cold asked someone 
 a clever fellow from the cold indeed why it was hot if it had been from the cold ours would not have rotted either but he says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he says we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off we can hardly do it but theirs he says are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder 
 all were silent 
 it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to gobble the same food as the gentry 
 no one contradicted him 
 that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still finish carting the dead away and as for the wolves he says 
 that was a real battle said an old soldier the only one worth remembering but since that only been tormenting folk 
 and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we ran at them and my word they let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees pardon they say only one case they say platov took poleon himself twice but he know the right charm he catches him and catches him no good he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away and no way of killing him either 
 a liar kiselev when i come to look at you 
 liar indeed the real truth 
 if he fell into my hands when caught him bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down what a lot of men ruined 
 well anyhow going to end it he come here again remarked the old soldier yawning 
 the conversation flagged and the soldiers began settling down to sleep 
 look at the stars wonderful how they shine you would think the women had spread out their linen said one of the men gazing with admiration at the milky way 
 a sign of a good harvest next year 
 we shall want some more wood 
 you warm your back and your belly gets frozen queer 
 o lord 
 what are you pushing for is the fire only for you look how sprawling 
 in the silence that ensued the snoring of those who had fallen asleep could be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now and again exchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general merry laughter 
 hark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of the soldiers and what a lot of them there are 
 one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company 
 having such fun said he coming back two frenchies have turned up quite frozen and the an awful swaggerer singing songs 
 oh go across and have a look 
 and several of the men went over to the fifth company

 eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you lost or have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wood shouted a and man screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire and you jackdaw go and fetch some wood said he to another soldier 
 this man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they called jackdaw a thin little fellow with a sharp nose rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood 
 bring it here fine 
 they split up the wood pressed it down on the fire blew at it with their mouths and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats making the flames hiss and crackle the men drew nearer and lit their pipes the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood setting his arms akimbo began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood 
 mother the dew is cold but clear well that a musketeer he sang pretending to hiccough after each syllable 
 look out your soles will fly off shouted the man noticing that the sole of the boot was hanging loose what a fellow you are for dancing 
 the dancer stopped pulled off the loose piece of leather and threw it on the fire 
 right enough friend said he and having sat down took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his foot the steam that spoils them he added stretching out his feet toward the fire 
 soon be issuing us new ones they say that when finished hammering them to receive double kits 
 and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it seems said one sergeant major 
 had an eye on him this long while said the other 
 well a poor sort of soldier 
 but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday 
 yes all very well but when a feet are frozen how can he walk 
 eh talk nonsense said a sergeant major 
 do you want to be doing the same said an old soldier turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet 
 well you know said the man they called jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the fire a plump man gets thin but for a thin one death take me now got no strength left he added with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital aching all over anyway i be able to keep up 
 do do replied the sergeant major quietly 
 the soldier said no more and the talk went on 
 what a lot of those frenchies were taken today and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on said a soldier starting a new theme they were no more than 
 the cossacks have taken their boots they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in the dancer as they turned them over one seemed still alive and would you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo 
 but a clean folk lads the first man went on he was white as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows you might think they were nobles 
 well what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there 
 but they understand our talk at all said the dancer with a puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in his own way a queer lot 
 but strange friends continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well those dead had been lying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as white as paper clean and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke 
 was it from the cold asked someone 
 a clever fellow from the cold indeed why it was hot if it had been from the cold ours would not have rotted either but he says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he says we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off we can hardly do it but theirs he says are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder 
 all were silent 
 it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to gobble the same food as the gentry 
 no one contradicted him 
 that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still finish carting the dead away and as for the wolves he says 
 that was a real battle said an old soldier the only one worth remembering but since that only been tormenting folk 
 and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we ran at them and my word they let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees pardon they say only one case they say platov took poleon himself twice but he know the right charm he catches him and catches him no good he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away and no way of killing him either 
 a liar kiselev when i come to look at you 
 liar indeed the real truth 
 if he fell into my hands when caught him bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down what a lot of men ruined 
 well anyhow going to end it he come here again remarked the old soldier yawning 
 the conversation flagged and the soldiers began settling down to sleep 
 look at the stars wonderful how they shine you would think the women had spread out their linen said one of the men gazing with admiration at the milky way 
 a sign of a good harvest next year 
 we shall want some more wood 
 you warm your back and your belly gets frozen queer 
 o lord 
 what are you pushing for is the fire only for you look how sprawling 
 in the silence that ensued the snoring of those who had fallen asleep could be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now and again exchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general merry laughter 
 hark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of the soldiers and what a lot of them there are 
 one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company 
 having such fun said he coming back two frenchies have turned up quite frozen and the an awful swaggerer singing songs 
 oh go across and have a look 
 and several of the men went over to the fifth company

 the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest a huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost 
 about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest and the crackling of dry branches 
 a bear lads said one of the men 
 they all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another 
 these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest they came up to the fire hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand one was taller than the other he wore an hat and seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he had been going to sit down but fell the other a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head was stronger he raised his companion and said something pointing to his mouth the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them 
 the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was morel his orderly 
 when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers who could not understand him ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire looking at the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes occasionally he emitted a groan and then again became silent morel pointing to his shoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed a russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a french officer into his hut to warm him and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him ramballe was told to go he rose and tried to walk but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up 
 you do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking and turning mockingly to ramballe 
 oh you fool why talk rubbish lout that you are a real peasant came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier 
 they surrounded ramballe lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers and carried him to the hut ramballe put his arms around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively 
 oh you fine fellows my kind kind friends these are men oh my brave kind friends and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child 
 meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire surrounded by the soldiers 
 morel a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes was wearing a cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a french song in a hoarse broken voice with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him 
 now then now then teach us how it goes soon pick it up how is it said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing 
 vive henri quatre vive ce roi valiant sang morel winking ce diable a quatre 
 long live henry the fourth that valiant king that rowdy devil 
 vivarika sedyablyaka repeated the soldier flourishing his arm and really catching the tune 
 bravo ha ha ha rose their rough joyous laughter from all sides 
 morel wrinkling up his face laughed too 
 well go on go on 
 qui eut le triple talent 
 de boire de battre 
 et un vert galant 
 who had a triple talent 
 for drinking for fighting 
 and for being a gallant old boy 
 it goes smoothly too well now zaletaev 
 ke zaletaev brought out with effort he drawled laboriously pursing his lips e he sang 
 fine just like the frenchie oh ho ho do you want some more to eat 
 give him some porridge it takes a long time to get filled up after starving 
 they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him the older men who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a smile 
 they are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat even wormwood grows on its own root 
 o lord o lord how starry it is tremendous that means a hard frost 
 they all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was looking at them began to disport themselves in the dark sky now flaring up now vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another

 book intestine of the leviathan 
 chapter ii 
 
 ancient history of the sewer 
 let the reader imagine paris lifted off like a cover the subterranean of sewers from a eye view will outline on the banks a species of large branch grafted on the river 
 on the right bank the belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch the secondary ducts will form the branches and those without exit the twigs 
 this figure is but a summary one and half exact the right angle which is the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications being very rare in vegetation 
 a more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed by supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet as intricate as a thicket against a background of shadows and the misshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion and as at haphazard now by their angles again by their extremities 
 sinks and sewers played a great part in the middle ages in the lower empire and in the orient of old 
 the masses regarded these beds of decomposition these monstrous cradles of death with a fear that was almost religious 
 the vermin ditch of benares is no less conducive to giddiness than the lions ditch of babylon according to the rabbinical books swore by the sink of nineveh 
 it was from the sewer of munster that john of leyden produced his false moon and it was from the of kekscheb that oriental menalchme mokanna the veiled prophet of khorassan caused his false sun to emerge 
 the history of men is reflected in the history of sewers the germoniae narrated rome 
 the sewer of paris has been an ancient and formidable thing 
 it has been a sepulchre it has served as an asylum 
 crime intelligence social protest liberty of conscience thought theft all that human laws persecute or have persecuted is hidden in that hole the maillotins in the fourteenth century the of the fifteenth the huguenots in the sixteenth illuminated in the seventeenth the chauffeurs brigands in the eighteenth 
 a hundred years ago the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence the pickpocket in danger slipped thither the forest had its cave paris had its sewer vagrancy that gallic picareria accepted the sewer as the adjunct of the cour des miracles and at evening it returned thither fierce and sly through the maubuee outlet as into a 
 steps on the aventine hill leading to the tiber to which the bodies of executed criminals were dragged by hooks to be thrown into the tiber 
 it was quite natural that those who had the or the rue for the scene of their daily labor should have for their domicile by night the culvert of the or the catch basin of hurepoix hence a throng of souvenirs 
 all sorts of phantoms haunt these long solitary corridors everywhere is putrescence and miasma here and there are where villon within converses with rabelais without 
 the sewer in ancient paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of all attempts 
 political economy therein spies a detritus social philosophy there beholds a residuum 
 the sewer is the conscience of the city 
 everything there converges and confronts everything else 
 in that livid spot there are shades but there are no longer any secrets each thing bears its true form or at least its definitive form the mass of filth has this in its favor that it is not a liar ingenuousness has taken refuge there 
 the mask of basil is to be found there but one beholds its cardboard and its strings and the inside as well as the outside and it is accentuated by honest mud false nose is its neighbor

 ancient history of the sewer 
 let the reader imagine paris lifted off like a cover the subterranean of sewers from a eye view will outline on the banks a species of large branch grafted on the river 
 on the right bank the belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch the secondary ducts will form the branches and those without exit the twigs 
 this figure is but a summary one and half exact the right angle which is the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications being very rare in vegetation 
 a more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed by supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet as intricate as a thicket against a background of shadows and the misshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion and as at haphazard now by their angles again by their extremities 
 sinks and sewers played a great part in the middle ages in the lower empire and in the orient of old 
 the masses regarded these beds of decomposition these monstrous cradles of death with a fear that was almost religious 
 the vermin ditch of benares is no less conducive to giddiness than the lions ditch of babylon according to the rabbinical books swore by the sink of nineveh 
 it was from the sewer of munster that john of leyden produced his false moon and it was from the of kekscheb that oriental menalchme mokanna the veiled prophet of khorassan caused his false sun to emerge 
 the history of men is reflected in the history of sewers the germoniae narrated rome 
 the sewer of paris has been an ancient and formidable thing 
 it has been a sepulchre it has served as an asylum 
 crime intelligence social protest liberty of conscience thought theft all that human laws persecute or have persecuted is hidden in that hole the maillotins in the fourteenth century the of the fifteenth the huguenots in the sixteenth illuminated in the seventeenth the chauffeurs brigands in the eighteenth 
 a hundred years ago the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence the pickpocket in danger slipped thither the forest had its cave paris had its sewer vagrancy that gallic picareria accepted the sewer as the adjunct of the cour des miracles and at evening it returned thither fierce and sly through the maubuee outlet as into a 
 steps on the aventine hill leading to the tiber to which the bodies of executed criminals were dragged by hooks to be thrown into the tiber 
 it was quite natural that those who had the or the rue for the scene of their daily labor should have for their domicile by night the culvert of the or the catch basin of hurepoix hence a throng of souvenirs 
 all sorts of phantoms haunt these long solitary corridors everywhere is putrescence and miasma here and there are where villon within converses with rabelais without 
 the sewer in ancient paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of all attempts 
 political economy therein spies a detritus social philosophy there beholds a residuum 
 the sewer is the conscience of the city 
 everything there converges and confronts everything else 
 in that livid spot there are shades but there are no longer any secrets each thing bears its true form or at least its definitive form the mass of filth has this in its favor that it is not a liar ingenuousness has taken refuge there 
 the mask of basil is to be found there but one beholds its cardboard and its strings and the inside as well as the outside and it is accentuated by honest mud false nose is its neighbor 
 all the uncleannesses of civilization once past their use fall into this trench of truth where the immense social sliding ends 
 they are there engulfed but they display themselves there 
 this mixture is a confession there no more false appearances no plastering over is possible filth removes its shirt absolute denudation puts to the rout all illusions and mirages there is nothing more except what really exists presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end there the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness a tells a tale of domesticity there the core of an apple which has entertained literary opinions becomes an once more the effigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris caiphas spittle meets puking the which comes from the jostles the nail whence hangs the end of the suicide

 chapter x 
 
 the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been and still is written about the berezina on the french side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on the russian side merely because in petersburg far from the seat of war a plan again one of had been devised to catch napoleon in a strategic trap at the berezina river everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french in guns and men lost than krasnoe had been as the figures show 
 the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action the one kutuzov and the general mass of the army demanded namely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridges broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and women with children who were with the french transport all carried on by vis inertiae pressed forward into boats and into the water and did not surrender 
 that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them but those who surrendered while remaining in the same pitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life the french did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners with whom the russians did not know what to do perished of cold and hunger despite their captors desire to save them they felt that it could not be otherwise the most compassionate russian commanders those favorable to the french and even the frenchmen in the russian service could do nothing for the prisoners the french perished from the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed it was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the french who though not harmful or hated or guilty were simply unnecessary some russians even did that but they were exceptions 
 certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope their ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collective flight and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated 
 the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the remnant especially after the berezina on which in consequence of the petersburg plan special hopes had been placed by the russians and the keener grew the passions of the russian commanders blamed one another and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of the petersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutuzov led to dissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more strongly expressed the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn 
 because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans that he would answer with his phrases which they thought were mere phrases about a golden bridge about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions and so forth they had heard all that before and all he said that it was necessary to await provisions or that the men had no boots was so simple while what they proposed was so complicated and clever that it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they though not in power were commanders of genius 
 after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg hero wittgenstein this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders only once after the affair of the berezina did he get angry and write to bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor the following letter 
 on account of your spells of ill health will your excellency please be so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and there await further commands and appointments from his imperial majesty 
 but after departure the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich joined the army he had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov now having come to the army he informed kutuzov of the displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days time 
 the old man experienced in court as well as in military affairs this same kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief against the wishes and who had removed the grand duke and heir apparent from the army who on his own authority and contrary to the will had decided on the abandonment of moscow now realized at once that his day was over that his part was played and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court he saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest 
 on the of november kutuzov entered vilna his dear vilna as he called it twice during his career kutuzov had been governor of vilna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found old friends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all 
 chichagov one of the most zealous and who had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent chichagov noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with turkey in independently of kutuzov and found that peace had already been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really this chichagov was the first to meet kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay in undress naval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handed kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov who knew of the accusations that were being directed against kutuzov 
 when speaking to chichagov kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him 
 you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on the contrary i can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to be animated by the same desire 
 kutuzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetrating smile i meant merely to say what i said 
 contrary to the wish kutuzov detained the greater part of the army at vilna those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town he attended to army affairs reluctantly left everything to his generals and while awaiting the arrival led a dissipated life 
 having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suite count tolstoy prince volkonski arakcheev and others the emperor reached vilna on the eleventh and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well as a guard of honor of the semenov regiment 
 a courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with three horses shouted coming and konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform kutuzov who was waiting in the hall little lodge 
 a minute later the old large stout figure in uniform his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach waddled out into the porch he put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand the report he had prepared for the emperor 
 there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka furiously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be descried 
 from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all over readjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and at the very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleigh lifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth ingratiating voice 
 the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutuzov from head to foot frowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man extended his arms and embraced him and this embrace too owing to a impression related to his innermost feelings had its usual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sob 
 the emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard and again pressing the old hand went with him into the castle 
 when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at krasnoe and the berezina and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark the same submissive expressionless look with which he had listened to the commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now 
 when kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by voice saying 
 your serene highness 
 kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of count tolstoy who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him 
 suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver it was the order of st george of the first class

 bruneseau 
 the sewer of paris in the middle ages was legendary 
 in the sixteenth century henri ii 
 attempted a bore which failed not a hundred years ago the mercier attests the fact was abandoned to itself and fared as best it might 
 such was this ancient paris delivered over to quarrels to indecision and to gropings 
 it was tolerably stupid for a long time later on showed how understanding comes to cities 
 but in the good old times the capital had not much head 
 it did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally or materially and could not sweep out filth any better than it could abuses everything presented an obstacle everything raised a question the sewer for example was refractory to every itinerary one could no more find bearings in the sewer than one could understand position in the city above the unintelligible below the inextricable beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned the confusion of caverns daedalus backed up babel 
 sometimes the paris sewer took a notion to overflow as though this misunderstood nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage there occurred infamous to relate inundations of the sewer at times that stomach of civilization digested badly the flowed back into the throat of the city and paris got an of her own filth 
 these resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points they were warnings very badly accepted however the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire and did not admit that the filth should return 
 drive it out better 
 the inundation of is one of the actual memories of parisians of the age of eighty 
 the mud spread in over the place des victoires where stands the statue of louis xiv it entered the rue by the two mouths to the sewer in the the rue through the sewer the rue through the sewer de la sonnerie the rue popincourt through the sewer of the the rue de la roquette through the sewer of the rue de lappe it covered the drain of the rue des to the height of centimetres and to the south through the vent of the seine performing its functions in inverse sense it penetrated the rue mazarine the rue de and the rue des marais where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and nine metres a few paces distant from the house in which racine had lived respecting in the seventeenth century the poet more than the king it attained its maximum depth in the rue where it rose to the height of three feet above the of the and its maximum length in the rue where it spread out over a stretch two hundred and metres in length 
 at the beginning of this century the sewer of paris was still a mysterious place 
 mud can never enjoy a good fame but in this case its evil renown reached the verge of the terrible 
 paris knew in a confused way that she had under her a terrible cavern people talked of it as of that monstrous bed of thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length and which might have served behemoth for a bathtub 
 the great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain points 
 we were then very near the epoch when the carts from the summit of which fraternized with the marquis de crequi discharged their loads directly into the sewer 
 as for cleaning out that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away 
 rome left some poetry to her sewer and called it the gemoniae paris insulted hers and entitled it the science and superstition were in accord in horror the polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend the goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the mouffetard sewer the corpses of the marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la barillerie fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of to the great hiatus of the sewer of the marais which remained yawning until in the rue almost opposite the sign of the gallant messenger 
 the mouth of the sewer of the rue de la mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there with its grating of iron with points simulating a row of teeth it was like a maw in that fatal street breathing forth hell upon men 
 the popular imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite the sewer had no bottom 
 the sewer was the lower world

 the sewer of paris in the middle ages was legendary 
 in the sixteenth century henri ii 
 attempted a bore which failed not a hundred years ago the mercier attests the fact was abandoned to itself and fared as best it might 
 such was this ancient paris delivered over to quarrels to indecision and to gropings 
 it was tolerably stupid for a long time later on showed how understanding comes to cities 
 but in the good old times the capital had not much head 
 it did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally or materially and could not sweep out filth any better than it could abuses everything presented an obstacle everything raised a question the sewer for example was refractory to every itinerary one could no more find bearings in the sewer than one could understand position in the city above the unintelligible below the inextricable beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned the confusion of caverns daedalus backed up babel 
 sometimes the paris sewer took a notion to overflow as though this misunderstood nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage there occurred infamous to relate inundations of the sewer at times that stomach of civilization digested badly the flowed back into the throat of the city and paris got an of her own filth 
 these resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points they were warnings very badly accepted however the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire and did not admit that the filth should return 
 drive it out better 
 the inundation of is one of the actual memories of parisians of the age of eighty 
 the mud spread in over the place des victoires where stands the statue of louis xiv it entered the rue by the two mouths to the sewer in the the rue through the sewer the rue through the sewer de la sonnerie the rue popincourt through the sewer of the the rue de la roquette through the sewer of the rue de lappe it covered the drain of the rue des to the height of centimetres and to the south through the vent of the seine performing its functions in inverse sense it penetrated the rue mazarine the rue de and the rue des marais where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and nine metres a few paces distant from the house in which racine had lived respecting in the seventeenth century the poet more than the king it attained its maximum depth in the rue where it rose to the height of three feet above the of the and its maximum length in the rue where it spread out over a stretch two hundred and metres in length 
 at the beginning of this century the sewer of paris was still a mysterious place 
 mud can never enjoy a good fame but in this case its evil renown reached the verge of the terrible 
 paris knew in a confused way that she had under her a terrible cavern people talked of it as of that monstrous bed of thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length and which might have served behemoth for a bathtub 
 the great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain points 
 we were then very near the epoch when the carts from the summit of which fraternized with the marquis de crequi discharged their loads directly into the sewer 
 as for cleaning out that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away 
 rome left some poetry to her sewer and called it the gemoniae paris insulted hers and entitled it the science and superstition were in accord in horror the polypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend the goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the mouffetard sewer the corpses of the marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la barillerie fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of to the great hiatus of the sewer of the marais which remained yawning until in the rue almost opposite the sign of the gallant messenger 
 the mouth of the sewer of the rue de la mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which had their source there with its grating of iron with points simulating a row of teeth it was like a maw in that fatal street breathing forth hell upon men 
 the popular imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite the sewer had no bottom 
 the sewer was the lower world 
 the idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police to try that unknown thing to cast the plummet into that shadow to set out on a voyage of discovery in that would have dared it was alarming 
 nevertheless some one did present himself the had its christopher columbus 
 one day in during one of the rare apparitions which the emperor made in paris the minister of the interior some decres or cretet or other came to the intimate levee in the carrousel there was audible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of the great republic and of the great empire then door was blocked with heroes men from the rhine from the escaut from the adige and from the nile companions of joubert of desaix of marceau of hoche of kleber the aerostiers of fleurus the grenadiers of mayence the of genoa hussars whom the pyramids had looked down upon artillerists whom had spattered with mud cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the zuyderzee some had followed bonaparte upon the bridge of lodi others had accompanied murat in the trenches of mantua others had preceded lannes in the hollow road of montebello the whole army of that day was present there in the of the tuileries represented by a squadron or a platoon and guarding napoleon in repose and that was the splendid epoch when the grand army had marengo behind it and austerlitz before said the minister of the interior to napoleon yesterday i saw the most intrepid man in your man is that said the emperor brusquely and what has he wants to do something is visit the sewers of paris

 next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by his presence kutuzov had received the order of st george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the proprieties were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and when kutuzov conforming to a custom of day ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words the old comedian 
 the displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilna by the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign 
 when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe they all understood that the war was not ended 
 kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had gained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people of the possibility of failure and so forth 
 this being the field frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war 
 to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method was to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the beginning of the russian campaign to transfer the authority to the emperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander in feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change 
 with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor toll konovnitsyn and ermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the field great weakness and failing health 
 his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another and in fact his health was poor 
 so naturally simply and gradually just as he had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia and then to the army when he was needed there now when his part was played out place was taken by a new and necessary performer 
 the war besides its national significance dear to every russian heart was now to assume another a european significance 
 the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war another leader was necessary having qualities and views differing from and animated by different motives 
 alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of russia 
 kutuzov did not understand what europe the balance of power or napoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative of the russian people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothing left to do as a russian nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die and kutuzov died

 the visit took place 
 it was a formidable campaign a nocturnal battle against pestilence and suffocation 
 it was at the same time a voyage of discovery 
 one of the survivors of this expedition an intelligent workingman who was very young at the time related curious details with regard to it several years ago which bruneseau thought himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of official style 
 the processes of disinfection were at that epoch extremely rudimentary 
 hardly had bruneseau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to go any further 
 the operation was complicated the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same time to proceed to note the entrances of water to count the gratings and the vents to lay out in detail the branches to indicate the currents at the point where they parted to define the respective bounds of the divers basins to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer to measure the height under the of each drain and the width at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each either of the bottom of the arch or on the soil of the street 
 they advanced with toil 
 the lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere 
 from time to time a fainting sewerman was carried out 
 at certain points there were precipices the soil had given away the pavement had crumbled the sewer had changed into a bottomless well they found nothing solid a man disappeared suddenly they had great difficulty in getting him out again 
 on the advice of fourcroy they lighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin from time to time in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected 
 in some places the wall was covered with misshapen would have said tumors the very stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere 
 bruneseau in his exploration proceeded down hill 
 at the point of separation of the two of the he deciphered upon a projecting stone the date of this stone indicated the limits where philibert delorme charged by henri ii with visiting the subterranean drains of paris had halted this stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the ponceau drain of the old rue vaulted between and and the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal walled and vaulted in these two vaults especially the less ancient that of were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer which dated from an epoch when the brook of fresh water of menilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the grand sewer of paris an advancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet de chambre to the king something like transformed into lebel 
 here and there particularly beneath the they thought they recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons excavated in the very sewer itself 
 hideous an iron was hanging in one of these cells 
 they walled them all up 
 some of their finds were singular among others the skeleton of an who had disappeared from the jardin des plantes in a disappearance probably connected with the famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the rue des bernardins in the last year of the eighteenth century 
 the poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the sewer 
 beneath this long arched drain which terminated at the a perfectly preserved basket excited the admiration of all connoisseurs 
 everywhere the mire which the sewermen came to handle with intrepidity abounded in precious objects jewels of gold and silver precious stones coins 
 if a giant had filtered this cesspool he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair at the point where the two branches of the rue du temple and of the rue separate they picked up a singular huguenot medal in copper bearing on one side the pig hooded with a hat and on the other a wolf with a tiara on his head 
 the most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the grand sewer this entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but the hinges remained 
 from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which arrested there in its passage no doubt had floated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart 
 bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag and examined it 
 it was of very fine batiste and in one of the corners less frayed than the rest they made out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters 
 lavbesp 
 the crown was the coronet of a marquis and the seven letters signified laubespine they recognized the fact that what they had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of marat 
 marat in his youth had had amorous intrigues 
 this was when he was a member of the household of the comte in the capacity of physician to the stables from these love affairs historically proved with a great lady he had retained this sheet 
 as a waif or a souvenir 
 at his death as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house they buried him in it 
 some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in that in which the tragic friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuousness 
 bruneseau passed on 
 they left that rag where it hung they did not put the finishing touch to it did this arise from scorn or from respect 
 marat deserved both and then destiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it 
 besides the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select 
 in short the relic was a strange one 
 a marquise had slept in it marat had rotted in it it had traversed the pantheon to end with the rats of the sewer this chamber rag of which watteau would formerly have joyfully sketched every fold had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed gaze of dante 
 the whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of paris lasted seven years from to

 in the second year of his work bruneseau engaged the assistance of his nargaud 
 it was thus that at the beginning of the century ancient society cleansed its double bottom and performed the toilet of its sewer there was that much clean at all events

 as generally happens pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the third day there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was laid up for three months he had what the doctors termed bilious fever but despite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave him medicines to drink he recovered 
 scarcely any impression was left on mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness he remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physical distress and pains in his feet and side he remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of petya rostov that same day he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle of borodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostovs house at yaroslavl and denisov who told him this news also mentioned death supposing that pierre had heard of it long before all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its significance just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over all the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel he immediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants terenty and vaska who had come from moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had been living on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him 
 it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that he would be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue about the death of prince andrew the death of his wife and the destruction of the french 
 a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow filled soul during his convalescence he was surprised to find that this inner freedom which was independent of external conditions now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he was alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there since she was no more 
 oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french had gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendid 
 and by old habit he asked himself the question well and what then what am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answer well i shall live ah how splendid 
 the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had continually sought to find the aim of life no longer existed for him now that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time 
 he could not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind of rule or words or ideas but faith in an god formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search for an aim had been simply a search for god and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago that god is here and everywhere in his captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet all his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes 
 in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such had european life politics freemasonry philosophy and philanthropy seemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as he had accounted them his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness worldliness and senselessness now however he had learned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything and therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over heads and gladly regarded the eternally great unfathomable and infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became that dreadful question what for which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for him to that question what for a simple answer was now always ready in his soul because there is a god that god without whose will not one hair falls from a head

 a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow filled soul during his convalescence he was surprised to find that this inner freedom which was independent of external conditions now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he was alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there since she was no more 
 oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french had gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendid 
 and by old habit he asked himself the question well and what then what am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answer well i shall live ah how splendid 
 the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had continually sought to find the aim of life no longer existed for him now that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time 
 he could not see an aim for he now had faith not faith in any kind of rule or words or ideas but faith in an god formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search for an aim had been simply a search for god and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago that god is here and everywhere in his captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet all his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes 
 in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such had european life politics freemasonry philosophy and philanthropy seemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as he had accounted them his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness worldliness and senselessness now however he had learned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything and therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over heads and gladly regarded the eternally great unfathomable and infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became that dreadful question what for which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for him to that question what for a simple answer was now always ready in his soul because there is a god that god without whose will not one hair falls from a head

 return of the jedi 
 iii 
 
 the sandstorm obscured breath thought motion the roar of italone was disorienting sounding like it came from everywhere at once as if theuniverse were composed of noise and this was its chaotic center 
 the seven heroes walked step by step through the murky gale holding on to oneanother so as not to get lost artoo was first following the signal of the homingdevice which sang to him in a language not garbled by the wind threepio camenext then leia guiding han and finally luke and lando supporting the hobblingwookiee 
 artoo beeped loudly and they all looked up vague dark shapes could be seenthrough the typhoon 
 i know shouted han all i can see is a lot of blowing sand 
 all any of us can see leia shouted back 
 then i guess getting better 
 for a few steps the dark shapes grew darker and then out of the darkness themillennium falcon appeared flanked by and a soon as the group huddled under the bulk of the falcon the wind died down tosomething more describable as a severe weather condition threepio hit a the gangplank lowered with a hum 
 solo turned to skywalker got to hand it to you kid you were pretty goodout there 
 luke shrugged it off i had a lot of help he started toward his 
 han stopped him his manner suddenly quieter even serious thanks forcoming after me luke 
 luke felt embarrassed for some reason he know how to respond toanything but a wisecrack from the old pirate think nothing of it he finally said 
 no thinkin a lot about it that carbon freeze was the closest thing todead there is and it just sleepin it was a big wide awake nothin 
 a nothing from which luke and the others had saved their own livesin great peril at his expense for no other reason than thathe was their friend thiswas a new idea for the cocky once terrible and wonderful there wasjeopardy in this turn of events it made him feel somehow blinder than before butvisionary as well it was confusing once he was alone now he was a part 
 that realization made him feel indebted a feeling always abhorred onlynow the debt was somehow a new kind of bond a bond of brotherhood it was evenfreeing in a strange way 
 he was no longer so alone 
 no longer alone 
 luke saw a difference had come over his friend like a sea change it was agentle moment he want to disturb it so he only nodded 
 chewie growled affectionately at the young jedi warrior mussing his hair like aproud uncle and leia warmly hugged him 
 they all had great love for solo but somehow it was easier to show it by beingdemonstrative to luke 
 see you back at the fleet luke called moving toward his ship 
 why you leave that crate and come with us solo nudged 
 i have a promise i have to keep firstto an old fried a very old friend hesmiled to himself in afterthought 
 well hurry back leia urged the entire alliance should be assembled bynow she saw something in face she put a name to it but it scaredher and simultaneously made her feel closer to him hurry back she repeated 
 i will he promised come on artoo 
 artoo rolled toward the beeping a farewell to threepio 
 artoo threepio called out fondly may the maker bless will watch out for him you master luke 
 but luke and the little droid were already gone on the far end of the flyer 
 the others stood without moving for a moment trying to see their futures in theswirling sand 
 lando jarred them awake come on get off this miserable dirt luck here had been abominable he hoped to fare better in the next game itwould be house rules for a while he knew but he might be able to load a few dicealong the way 
 solo clapped him on the back guess i owe you some thanks too lando 
 figured if i left you frozen like that just give me bad luck the rest of mylife so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner as later 
 he means welcome leia smiled we all mean kissed han on the cheek to say it personally one more time 
 they all headed up the ramp of the falcon solo paused just before goinginside and gave the ship a little pat lookin good old girl i never live to see you again 
 he entered at last closing the hatch behind him 
 luke did the same in the he strapped himself into the cockpit startedup the engines felt the comfortable roar he looked at his damaged hand wirescrossed aluminum bones like spokes in a puzzle he wondered what the solutionwas or the puzzle for that matter he pulled a black glove over the exposedinfrastructure set the controls and for the second time in his life herocketed off his home planet into the stars 
 the super star destroyer rested in space above the death starbattle station and its green neighbor endor the destroyer was a massive by numerous smaller warships of various kinds which hovered or dartedaround the great mother ship like children of different ages and range fleet cruisers bulky cargo vessels tie fighter escorts 
 the main bay of the destroyer opened an imperial shuttleemerged and accelerated toward the death star accompanied by four squads offighters 
 darth vader watched their approach on the viewscreen in the control room of thedeath star when docking was imminent he marched out of the command by commander jerjerrod and a phalanx of imperial stormtroopers andheaded toward the docking bay he was about to welcome his master 
 pulse and breathing were so they could not something in his chest became more electric around his meetings with theemperor he could not say how a feeling of fullness unrestrained passion these things were in heart as he neared his emperor thesethings and more 
 when he entered the docking bay thousands of imperial troops snapped toattention with a momentous clap the shuttle came to rest on the pod its ramplowered like a dragon jaw and the royal guard ran down red robesflapping as if they were licks of flame shooting out the mouth to herald the angry poised themselves at watchful guard in two lethal rows beside the filled the great hall at the top of the ramp the emperor appeared 
 slowly he walked down a small man was he shriveled with age and supported his bent frame on a gnarled cane and covered himself with a like the robe of the jedi only black his shrouded face was sothin of flesh it was nearly a skull his piercing yellow eyes seemed to burn through allat which they stared 
 when the emperor reached the bottom of the ramp commander jerjerrod hisgenerals and lord vader all kneeled before him the supreme dark rulerbeckoned to vader and began walking down the row of troops 
 rise my friend i would talk with you 
 vader rose and accompanied his master they were followed in procession bythe courtiers the royal guard jerjerrod and the death star elite mixed reverence and fear 
 vader felt complete at the side though the emptiness at his corenever left him it became a glorious emptiness in the glare of the cold exalted void that could encompass the universe and someday would encompassthe universewhen the emperor was dead 
 for that was final dream when learned all he could of the darkpower from this evil genius to take that power from seize it and keep its cold light athis own the emperor and devour his darkness and rule the universe rulewith his son at his side 
 for that was his other reclaim his boy to show luke the majesty ofthis shadow force why it was so potent why chosen rightly to follow its luke would come with him he knew that seed was sown they would ruletogether father and son 
 his dream was very close to realization he could feel it it was near eachevent fell into place as nudged it with jedi subtlety as pressed withdelicate dark strength 
 the death star will be completed on schedule my master vader breathed 
 yes i know replied the emperor you have done well lord vaderandnow i sense you wish to continue your search for the young skywalker 
 vader smiled beneath his armored mask the emperor always knew the senseof what was in his heart even if he know the specifics yes my master 
 patience my friend the supreme ruler cautioned you always haddifficulty showing patience in time he will seek you outand when he does youmust bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him tothe dark side of the force 
 yes my master together they would corrupt the child of thefather great dark glory for soon the old emperor would though thegalaxy would bend from the horror of that loss vader would remain to rule withyoung skywalker at his side as it was always meant to be 
 the emperor raised his head a degree scanning all the possible is proceeding as i have foreseen 
 he like vader had plans of his of spiritual violation themanipulation of lives and destinies he chuckled to himself savoring the nearnessof his conquest the final seduction of the young skywalker 
 luke left his parked at the edge of the water and carefully picked hisway through the adjoining swamp a heavy mist hung in layers about him junglesteam a strange insect flew at him from out of a cluster of hanging vines flutteredmadly about his head and vanished in the undergrowth something snarled lukeconcentrated momentarily the snarling stopped luke walked on 
 he had terribly ambivalent feelings about this place dagobah his place oftests of training to be a jedi this was where truly learned to use the force tolet it flow through him to whatever end he directed it so learned howcaretaking he must be in order to use the force well it was walking on light but toa jedi it was as stable as an earthen floor 
 dangerous creatures lurked in this swamp but to a jedi none were quicksand mires waited still as pools tentacles mingled with the hangingvines luke knew them all now they were all part of the living planet each integralto the force of which he too was a pulsing aspect 
 yet there were dark things here as dark reflections of thedark corners of his soul seen these things here run from them with them even faced them vanquished some of them 
 but some still cowered here these dark things 
 he climbed around a barricade of gnarled roots slippery with moss on theother side a smooth unimpeded path led straight in the direction he wanted to go buthe did not take it instead he plunged once more into the undergrowth 
 high overhead something black and flapping approached then veered paid no attention he just kept walking 
 the jungle thinned a bit beyond the next bog luke saw dwelling its odd little windows shedding a warm yellow light in thedamp he skirted the mire and crouching low entered the cottage 
 yoda stood smiling inside his small green hand clutching his walking stick forsupport waiting for you i was he nodded 
 he motioned luke to sit in a corner the boy was struck by how much morefrail manner tremor to the hand a weakness to the voice it madeluke afraid to speak to betray his shock at the old condition 
 that face you make yoda crinkled his tired brow cheerfully look i so badto young eyes 
 he tried to conceal his woeful countenance shifting his position in the crampedspace no masterof course not 
 i do yes i do the tiny jedi master chuckled gleefully sick old and weak he pointed a crooked finger at his young pupil whennine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not 
 the creature hobbled over to his bed still chuckling and with great effort laydown soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned it i have 
 luke shook his head you die master let you 
 trained well and strong with the force are not that strong twilightis upon me and soon night must fall that is the way of thingsthe way of theforce 
 but i need your help luke insisted i want to complete my training thegreat teacher leave him was too much still to understand taken so much from yoda already and as yet given back nothing he had muchhe wanted to share with the old creature 
 no more training do you require yoda assured him already know you thatwhich you need 
 then i am a jedi luke pressed no he knew he was not still lacked 
 yoda wrinkled up his wizened features not yet one thing you must confront then only then a full jedi be andconfront him you will sooner or later 
 luke knew this would be his test it could not be otherwise every quest had itfocus and vader was inextricably at the core of struggle it was agonizingfor him to put the question to words but after a long silence he again spoke to the oldjedi master darth vader my father 
 eyes filled with a weary compassion this boy was not yet a mancomplete a sad smile creased his face he seemed almost to grow smaller in his rest i need yes a rest 
 luke stared at the dwindling teacher trying to give the old one strength just bythe force of his love and will yoda i must know he whispered 
 your father he is yoda said simply 
 luke closed his eyes his mouth his heart to keep away the truth of what heknew was true 
 told you did he yoda asked 
 luke nodded but did not speak he wanted to keep the moment frozen toshelter it here to lock time and space in this room so it could never escape into therest of the universe with this terrible knowledge this unrelenting truth 
 a look of concern filled face unexpected this is and unfortunate 
 unfortunate that i know the truth a bitterness crept into voice buthe decide if it was directed at vader yoda himself or the universe at large 
 yoda gathered himself up with an effort that seemed to take all his that you rushed to face incomplete your training wasthatnot ready for the burden were you would have told you long ago had i lethimnow a great weakness you carry fear for you i do fear for you yes agreat tension seemed to pass out of him and he closed his eyes 
 master yoda i am sorry luke trembled to see the potent jedi so weak 
 i know but face vader again you must and sorry will not help he leanedforward and beckoned luke close to him luke crawled over to sit beside hismaster yoda continued his voice increasingly frail remember a strengthflows from the force when you rescued your friends you had revenge in yourheart beware of anger fear and aggression the dark side are they easily theyflow quick to join you in a fight once you start down the dark path forever will itdominate your destiny 
 he lay back in bed his breathing became shallow luke waited quietly afraidto move afraid to distract the old one an iota lest it jar his attention even a fractionfrom the business of just keeping the void at bay

 he caught his breath and exhaled his spirit passing from him like a sunny windblowing to another sky his body shivered once and he disappeared 
 luke sat beside the small empty bed for over an hour trying to fathom the depthof this loss it was unfathomable 
 his first feeling was one of boundless grief for himself for the could such a one as yoda be gone forever it felt like a black bottomless holehad filled his heart where the part that was yoda had lived

 return of the jedi 
 iii 
 
 the sandstorm obscured breath thought motion the roar of italone was disorienting sounding like it came from everywhere at once as if theuniverse were composed of noise and this was its chaotic center 
 the seven heroes walked step by step through the murky gale holding on to oneanother so as not to get lost artoo was first following the signal of the homingdevice which sang to him in a language not garbled by the wind threepio camenext then leia guiding han and finally luke and lando supporting the hobblingwookiee 
 artoo beeped loudly and they all looked up vague dark shapes could be seenthrough the typhoon 
 i know shouted han all i can see is a lot of blowing sand 
 all any of us can see leia shouted back 
 then i guess getting better 
 for a few steps the dark shapes grew darker and then out of the darkness themillennium falcon appeared flanked by and a soon as the group huddled under the bulk of the falcon the wind died down tosomething more describable as a severe weather condition threepio hit a the gangplank lowered with a hum 
 solo turned to skywalker got to hand it to you kid you were pretty goodout there 
 luke shrugged it off i had a lot of help he started toward his 
 han stopped him his manner suddenly quieter even serious thanks forcoming after me luke 
 luke felt embarrassed for some reason he know how to respond toanything but a wisecrack from the old pirate think nothing of it he finally said 
 no thinkin a lot about it that carbon freeze was the closest thing todead there is and it just sleepin it was a big wide awake nothin 
 a nothing from which luke and the others had saved their own livesin great peril at his expense for no other reason than thathe was their friend thiswas a new idea for the cocky once terrible and wonderful there wasjeopardy in this turn of events it made him feel somehow blinder than before butvisionary as well it was confusing once he was alone now he was a part 
 that realization made him feel indebted a feeling always abhorred onlynow the debt was somehow a new kind of bond a bond of brotherhood it was evenfreeing in a strange way 
 he was no longer so alone 
 no longer alone 
 luke saw a difference had come over his friend like a sea change it was agentle moment he want to disturb it so he only nodded 
 chewie growled affectionately at the young jedi warrior mussing his hair like aproud uncle and leia warmly hugged him 
 they all had great love for solo but somehow it was easier to show it by beingdemonstrative to luke 
 see you back at the fleet luke called moving toward his ship 
 why you leave that crate and come with us solo nudged 
 i have a promise i have to keep firstto an old fried a very old friend hesmiled to himself in afterthought 
 well hurry back leia urged the entire alliance should be assembled bynow she saw something in face she put a name to it but it scaredher and simultaneously made her feel closer to him hurry back she repeated 
 i will he promised come on artoo 
 artoo rolled toward the beeping a farewell to threepio 
 artoo threepio called out fondly may the maker bless will watch out for him you master luke 
 but luke and the little droid were already gone on the far end of the flyer 
 the others stood without moving for a moment trying to see their futures in theswirling sand 
 lando jarred them awake come on get off this miserable dirt luck here had been abominable he hoped to fare better in the next game itwould be house rules for a while he knew but he might be able to load a few dicealong the way 
 solo clapped him on the back guess i owe you some thanks too lando 
 figured if i left you frozen like that just give me bad luck the rest of mylife so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner as later 
 he means welcome leia smiled we all mean kissed han on the cheek to say it personally one more time 
 they all headed up the ramp of the falcon solo paused just before goinginside and gave the ship a little pat lookin good old girl i never live to see you again 
 he entered at last closing the hatch behind him 
 luke did the same in the he strapped himself into the cockpit startedup the engines felt the comfortable roar he looked at his damaged hand wirescrossed aluminum bones like spokes in a puzzle he wondered what the solutionwas or the puzzle for that matter he pulled a black glove over the exposedinfrastructure set the controls and for the second time in his life herocketed off his home planet into the stars 
 the super star destroyer rested in space above the death starbattle station and its green neighbor endor the destroyer was a massive by numerous smaller warships of various kinds which hovered or dartedaround the great mother ship like children of different ages and range fleet cruisers bulky cargo vessels tie fighter escorts 
 the main bay of the destroyer opened an imperial shuttleemerged and accelerated toward the death star accompanied by four squads offighters 
 darth vader watched their approach on the viewscreen in the control room of thedeath star when docking was imminent he marched out of the command by commander jerjerrod and a phalanx of imperial stormtroopers andheaded toward the docking bay he was about to welcome his master 
 pulse and breathing were so they could not something in his chest became more electric around his meetings with theemperor he could not say how a feeling of fullness unrestrained passion these things were in heart as he neared his emperor thesethings and more 
 when he entered the docking bay thousands of imperial troops snapped toattention with a momentous clap the shuttle came to rest on the pod its ramplowered like a dragon jaw and the royal guard ran down red robesflapping as if they were licks of flame shooting out the mouth to herald the angry poised themselves at watchful guard in two lethal rows beside the filled the great hall at the top of the ramp the emperor appeared 
 slowly he walked down a small man was he shriveled with age and supported his bent frame on a gnarled cane and covered himself with a like the robe of the jedi only black his shrouded face was sothin of flesh it was nearly a skull his piercing yellow eyes seemed to burn through allat which they stared 
 when the emperor reached the bottom of the ramp commander jerjerrod hisgenerals and lord vader all kneeled before him the supreme dark rulerbeckoned to vader and began walking down the row of troops 
 rise my friend i would talk with you 
 vader rose and accompanied his master they were followed in procession bythe courtiers the royal guard jerjerrod and the death star elite mixed reverence and fear 
 vader felt complete at the side though the emptiness at his corenever left him it became a glorious emptiness in the glare of the cold exalted void that could encompass the universe and someday would encompassthe universewhen the emperor was dead 
 for that was final dream when learned all he could of the darkpower from this evil genius to take that power from seize it and keep its cold light athis own the emperor and devour his darkness and rule the universe rulewith his son at his side 
 for that was his other reclaim his boy to show luke the majesty ofthis shadow force why it was so potent why chosen rightly to follow its luke would come with him he knew that seed was sown they would ruletogether father and son 
 his dream was very close to realization he could feel it it was near eachevent fell into place as nudged it with jedi subtlety as pressed withdelicate dark strength 
 the death star will be completed on schedule my master vader breathed 
 yes i know replied the emperor you have done well lord vaderandnow i sense you wish to continue your search for the young skywalker 
 vader smiled beneath his armored mask the emperor always knew the senseof what was in his heart even if he know the specifics yes my master 
 patience my friend the supreme ruler cautioned you always haddifficulty showing patience in time he will seek you outand when he does youmust bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him tothe dark side of the force 
 yes my master together they would corrupt the child of thefather great dark glory for soon the old emperor would though thegalaxy would bend from the horror of that loss vader would remain to rule withyoung skywalker at his side as it was always meant to be 
 the emperor raised his head a degree scanning all the possible is proceeding as i have foreseen 
 he like vader had plans of his of spiritual violation themanipulation of lives and destinies he chuckled to himself savoring the nearnessof his conquest the final seduction of the young skywalker 
 luke left his parked at the edge of the water and carefully picked hisway through the adjoining swamp a heavy mist hung in layers about him junglesteam a strange insect flew at him from out of a cluster of hanging vines flutteredmadly about his head and vanished in the undergrowth something snarled lukeconcentrated momentarily the snarling stopped luke walked on 
 he had terribly ambivalent feelings about this place dagobah his place oftests of training to be a jedi this was where truly learned to use the force tolet it flow through him to whatever end he directed it so learned howcaretaking he must be in order to use the force well it was walking on light but toa jedi it was as stable as an earthen floor 
 dangerous creatures lurked in this swamp but to a jedi none were quicksand mires waited still as pools tentacles mingled with the hangingvines luke knew them all now they were all part of the living planet each integralto the force of which he too was a pulsing aspect 
 yet there were dark things here as dark reflections of thedark corners of his soul seen these things here run from them with them even faced them vanquished some of them 
 but some still cowered here these dark things 
 he climbed around a barricade of gnarled roots slippery with moss on theother side a smooth unimpeded path led straight in the direction he wanted to go buthe did not take it instead he plunged once more into the undergrowth 
 high overhead something black and flapping approached then veered paid no attention he just kept walking 
 the jungle thinned a bit beyond the next bog luke saw dwelling its odd little windows shedding a warm yellow light in thedamp he skirted the mire and crouching low entered the cottage 
 yoda stood smiling inside his small green hand clutching his walking stick forsupport waiting for you i was he nodded 
 he motioned luke to sit in a corner the boy was struck by how much morefrail manner tremor to the hand a weakness to the voice it madeluke afraid to speak to betray his shock at the old condition 
 that face you make yoda crinkled his tired brow cheerfully look i so badto young eyes 
 he tried to conceal his woeful countenance shifting his position in the crampedspace no masterof course not 
 i do yes i do the tiny jedi master chuckled gleefully sick old and weak he pointed a crooked finger at his young pupil whennine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not 
 the creature hobbled over to his bed still chuckling and with great effort laydown soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned it i have 
 luke shook his head you die master let you 
 trained well and strong with the force are not that strong twilightis upon me and soon night must fall that is the way of thingsthe way of theforce 
 but i need your help luke insisted i want to complete my training thegreat teacher leave him was too much still to understand taken so much from yoda already and as yet given back nothing he had muchhe wanted to share with the old creature 
 no more training do you require yoda assured him already know you thatwhich you need 
 then i am a jedi luke pressed no he knew he was not still lacked 
 yoda wrinkled up his wizened features not yet one thing you must confront then only then a full jedi be andconfront him you will sooner or later 
 luke knew this would be his test it could not be otherwise every quest had itfocus and vader was inextricably at the core of struggle it was agonizingfor him to put the question to words but after a long silence he again spoke to the oldjedi master darth vader my father 
 eyes filled with a weary compassion this boy was not yet a mancomplete a sad smile creased his face he seemed almost to grow smaller in his rest i need yes a rest 
 luke stared at the dwindling teacher trying to give the old one strength just bythe force of his love and will yoda i must know he whispered 
 your father he is yoda said simply 
 luke closed his eyes his mouth his heart to keep away the truth of what heknew was true 
 told you did he yoda asked 
 luke nodded but did not speak he wanted to keep the moment frozen toshelter it here to lock time and space in this room so it could never escape into therest of the universe with this terrible knowledge this unrelenting truth 
 a look of concern filled face unexpected this is and unfortunate 
 unfortunate that i know the truth a bitterness crept into voice buthe decide if it was directed at vader yoda himself or the universe at large 
 yoda gathered himself up with an effort that seemed to take all his that you rushed to face incomplete your training wasthatnot ready for the burden were you would have told you long ago had i lethimnow a great weakness you carry fear for you i do fear for you yes agreat tension seemed to pass out of him and he closed his eyes 
 master yoda i am sorry luke trembled to see the potent jedi so weak 
 i know but face vader again you must and sorry will not help he leanedforward and beckoned luke close to him luke crawled over to sit beside hismaster yoda continued his voice increasingly frail remember a strengthflows from the force when you rescued your friends you had revenge in yourheart beware of anger fear and aggression the dark side are they easily theyflow quick to join you in a fight once you start down the dark path forever will itdominate your destiny 
 he lay back in bed his breathing became shallow luke waited quietly afraidto move afraid to distract the old one an iota lest it jar his attention even a fractionfrom the business of just keeping the void at bay 
 after a few minutes yoda looked at the boy once more and with a maximumeffort smiled gently the greatness of his spirit the only thing keeping his decrepitbody alive the emperor beware do not underestimate his powers orsuffer your fate you will when gone i amlast of the jedi will you the force is strong in your family pass on what youhavelearned hebegan to falter he closed his eyes thereisanothersky 
 he caught his breath and exhaled his spirit passing from him like a sunny windblowing to another sky his body shivered once and he disappeared 
 luke sat beside the small empty bed for over an hour trying to fathom the depthof this loss it was unfathomable

 book two 
 chapter iv 
 
 the pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the squadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village were assigned to denisov the squadron commander known throughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov cadet rostov ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland had lived with the squadron commander 
 on october the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of defeat the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual denisov who had been losing at cards all night had not yet come home when rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition rostov in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his horse rode up to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse and at last sprang down and called to his orderly 
 ah bondarenko dear friend said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse walk him up and down my dear fellow he continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy 
 yes your excellency answered the ukrainian gaily tossing his head 
 mind walk him up and down well 
 another hussar also rushed toward the horse but bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the head it was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him rostov patted the neck and then his flank and lingered for a moment 
 splendid what a horse he will be he thought with a smile and holding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of the porch his landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork in hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his face immediately brightened on seeing rostov schon gut morgen schon gut morgen he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased to greet the young man 
 a very good morning a very good morning 
 schon fleissig said rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen kaiser alexander hoch said he quoting words often repeated by the german landlord 
 busy already 
 hurrah for the austrians hurrah for the russians hurrah for emperor alexander 
 the german laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his cap and waving it above his head cried 
 und die ganze welt hoch 
 and hurrah for the whole world 
 rostov waved his cap above his head like the german and ctied laughing und vivat die ganze welt though neither the german cleaning his cowshed nor rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection and parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rostov going to the cottage he occupied with denisov 
 what about your master he asked lavrushka orderly whom all the regiment knew for a rogue 
 been in since the evening must have been losing answered lavrushka i know by now if he wins he comes back early to brag about it but if he stays out till morning it means lost and will come back in a rage will you have coffee 
 yes bring some 
 ten minutes later lavrushka brought the coffee coming said he now for trouble rostov looked out of the window and saw denisov coming home denisov was a small man with a red face sparkling black eyes and black tousled mustache and hair he wore an unfastened cloak wide breeches hanging down in creases and a crumpled shako on the back of his head he came up to the porch gloomily hanging his head 
 lavwuska he shouted loudly and angrily take it off blockhead 
 well i am taking it off replied voice 
 ah up already said denisov entering the room 
 long ago answered rostov i have already been for the hay and have seen fraulein mathilde 
 weally and been losing bwother i lost yesterday like a damned fool cried denisov not pronouncing his such ill luck such ill luck as soon as you left it began and went on hullo there tea 
 puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong teeth he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair 
 and what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed the rat he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands just fancy he let me win a single cahd not one cahd 
 he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he continued to shout 
 he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it gives the singles and snatches the doubles 
 he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away then he remained silent for a while and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering black eyes at rostov 
 if at least we had some women here but nothing foh one to do but dwink if we could only get to fighting soon hullo there he said turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a respectful cough 
 the squadron quartermaster said lavrushka 
 face puckered still more 
 wetched he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in it wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster 
 rostov took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles began counting them 
 ah telyanin how do they plucked me last night came voice from the next room 
 where at at the i knew it replied a piping voice and lieutenant telyanin a small officer of the same squadron entered the room 
 rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the guards just before this campaign he behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man 
 well young cavalryman how is my rook behaving he asked rook was a young horse telyanin had sold to rostov 
 the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another 
 i saw you riding this morning he added 
 oh all right a good horse answered rostov though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg he added 
 the cracked nothing teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use 
 yes please do said rostov 
 show you show you not a secret and a horse thank me for 
 then have it brought round said rostov wishing to avoid telyanin and he went out to give the order 
 in the passage denisov with a pipe was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him on seeing rostov denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where telyanin was sitting he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust 
 ugh i like that fellow he said regardless of the presence 
 rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say nor do i but one to do and having given his order he returned to telyanin 
 telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostov had left him rubbing his small white hands 
 well there certainly are disgusting people thought rostov as he entered 
 have you told them to bring the horse asked telyanin getting up and looking carelessly about him 
 i have 
 let us go ourselves i only came round to ask denisov about order have you got it denisov 
 not yet but where are you off to 
 i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said telyanin 
 they went through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters 
 when rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper he looked gloomily in face and said i am witing to her 
 he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write told rostov the contents of his letter 
 you see my fwiend he said we sleep when we love we are childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a god one is pua as on the first day of cweation that now send him to the devil busy he shouted to lavrushka who went up to him not in the least abashed 
 who should it be you yourself told him to come the quartermaster for the money 
 denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped 
 wetched business he muttered to himself how much is left in the puhse he asked turning to rostov 
 seven new and three old imperials 
 oh wetched well what are you standing there for you call the quahtehmasteh he shouted to lavrushka 
 please denisov let me lend you some i have some you know said rostov blushing 
 like bowwowing from my own fellows i growled denisov 
 but if you accept money from me like a comrade you will offend me really i have some rostov repeated 
 no i tell you 
 and denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow 
 where have you put it wostov 
 under the lower pillow 
 not there 
 denisov threw both pillows on the floor the purse was not there 
 a miwacle 
 wait you dropped it said rostov picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them 
 he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there 
 dear me can i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure said rostov i put it just here where is it he asked turning to lavrushka 
 i been in the room it must be where you put it 
 but it 
 always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it feel in your pockets 
 no if i thought of it being a treasure said rostov but i remember putting it there 
 lavrushka turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under the table searched everywhere and stood still in the middle of the room denisov silently watched movements and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found denisov glanced at rostov 
 wostov not been playing schoolboy twicks 
 rostov felt gaze fixed on him raised his eyes and instantly dropped them again all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not draw breath 
 and there been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves it must be here somewhere said lavrushka 
 now then you puppet look alive and hunt for it shouted denisov suddenly turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture if the purse found flog you flog you all 
 rostov his eyes avoiding denisov began buttoning his coat buckled on his saber and put on his cap 
 i must have that purse i tell you shouted denisov shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall 
 denisov let him alone i know who has taken it said rostov going toward the door without raising his eyes denisov paused thought a moment and evidently understanding what rostov hinted at seized his arm 
 nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords you are mad i tell you i allow it the purse is here flay this scoundwel alive and it will be found 
 i know who has taken it repeated rostov in an unsteady voice and went to the door 
 and i tell you you dahe to do it shouted denisov rushing at the cadet to restrain him 
 but rostov pulled away his arm and with as much anger as though denisov were his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face 
 do you understand what saying he said in a trembling voice there was no one else in the room except myself so that if it is not so then 
 he could not finish and ran out of the room 
 ah may the devil take you and evewybody were the last words rostov heard 
 rostov went to quarters 
 the master is not in gone to headquarters said orderly has something happened he added surprised at the troubled face 
 no nothing 
 only just missed him said the orderly 
 the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck and rostov without returning home took a horse and rode there there was an inn in the village which the officers frequented rostov rode up to it and saw horse at the porch 
 in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine 
 ah come here too young man he said smiling and raising his eyebrows 
 yes said rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word and he sat down at the nearest table 
 both were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in the room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant 
 when telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter 
 please be quick he said 
 the coin was a new one rostov rose and went up to telyanin 
 allow me to look at your purse he said in a low almost inaudible voice 
 with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised telyanin handed him the purse 
 yes a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and added look at it young man 
 rostov took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it and looked at telyanin the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry 
 if we get to vienna get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns nowhere to spend it said he well let me have it young man going 
 rostov did not speak 
 and you are you going to have lunch too they feed you quite decently here continued telyanin now then let me have it 
 he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rostov let go of it telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open as if to say yes yes i am putting my purse in my pocket and quite simple and is no business 
 well young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted brows he glanced into eyes 
 some flash as of an electric spark shot from eyes to and back and back again and again in an instant 
 come here said rostov catching hold of arm and almost dragging him to the window that money is you took it he whispered just above ear 
 what what how dare you what said telyanin 
 but these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon as soon as rostov heard them an enormous load of doubt fell from him he was glad and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to be completed 
 heaven only knows what the people here may imagine muttered telyanin taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room we must have an explanation 
 i know it and shall prove it said rostov 
 i 
 every muscle of pale terrified face began to quiver his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to face and his sobs were audible 
 count ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money take it he threw it on the table i have an old father and mother 
 rostov took the money avoiding eyes and went out of the room without a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you do it 
 count said telyanin drawing nearer to him 
 touch me said rostov drawing back if you need it take the money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn

 chapter 
 
 
 this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north and on my journey to his abode i unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of gimmerton the ostler at a roadside public house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very green oats newly reaped passed by and he remarked 
 frough gimmerton nah allas three wick after other folk wi ther harvest 
 gimmerton i residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy ah i know how far is it from this 
 happen fourteen mile th hills and a rough road he answered 
 a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross grange it was scarcely noon and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn besides i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again having rested a while i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village and with great fatigue to our beasts we managed the distance in some three hours 
 i left him there and proceeded down the valley alone the grey church looked greyer and the lonely churchyard lonelier i distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves it was sweet warm warm for travelling but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below had i seen it nearer august sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes in winter nothing more dreary in summer nothing more divine than those glens shut in by hills and those bluff bold swells of heath 
 i reached the grange before sunset and knocked for admittance but the family had retreated into the back premises i judged by one thin blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney and they did not hear i rode into the court under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting and an old woman reclined on the house steps smoking a meditative pipe 
 is mrs dean within i demanded of the dame 
 mistress dean nay she answered shoo bide here up at th heights 
 are you the housekeeper then i continued 
 ea aw keep th house she replied 
 well mr lockwood the master are there any rooms to lodge me in i wonder i wish to stay here all night 
 t maister she cried in astonishment whet whoiver knew yah wur coming yah sud ha send word nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t place nowt there 
 she threw down her pipe and bustled in the girl followed and i entered too soon perceiving that her report was true and moreover that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition i bid her be composed i would go out for a walk and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a for me to sup in and a bedroom to sleep in no sweeping and dusting only good fire and dry sheets were necessary she seemed willing to do her best though she thrust the into the grates in mistake for the poker and malappropriated several other articles of her craft but i retired confiding in her energy for a against my return wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion an afterthought brought me back when i had quitted the court 
 all well at the heights i inquired of the woman 
 eea owt ee knaw she answered skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders 
 i would have asked why mrs dean had deserted the grange but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis so i turned away and made my exit rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind and the mild glory of a rising moon in fading and the other i quitted the park and climbed the stony branching off to mr dwelling before i arrived in sight of it all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west but i could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass by that splendid moon i had neither to climb the gate nor to yielded to my hand that is an improvement i thought and i noticed another by the aid of my nostrils a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit trees 
 both doors and lattices were open and yet as is usually the case in a coal district a fine red fire illumined the chimney the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered and looked and listened in consequence being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as i lingered 
 said a voice as sweet as a silver for the third time you dunce not going to tell you again recollect or pull your hair 
 contrary then answered another in deep but softened tones and now kiss me for minding so well 
 no read it over first correctly without a single mistake 
 the male speaker began to read he was a young man respectably dressed and seated at a table having a book before him his handsome features glowed with pleasure and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention its owner stood behind her light shining ringlets blending at intervals with his brown locks as she bent to superintend his studies and her was lucky he could not see her face or he would never have been so steady i could and i bit my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiling beauty 
 the task was done not free from further blunders but the pupil claimed a reward and received at least five kisses which however he generously returned then they came to the door and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors i supposed i should be condemned in hareton heart if not by his mouth to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then and feeling very mean and malignant i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen there was unobstructed admittance on that side also and at the door sat my old friend nelly dean sewing and singing a song which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance uttered in far from musical accents 
 rayther by th haulf hev em swearing i my lugs frough morn to neeght nur hearken yah hahsiver said the tenant of the kitchen in answer to an unheard speech of a blazing shaime ut aw cannut oppen t blessed book bud yah set up them glories tuh sattan un all t flaysome wickednesses ut iver wer born intuh t warld oh a raight nowt un another un that poor be lost atween ye poor lad he added with a groan witched sartin o lord judge em fur norther law nur justice amang wer rullers 
 no or we should be sitting in flaming fagots i suppose retorted the singer but wisht old man and read your bible like a christian and never mind me this is fairy bonny goes to a dance 
 mrs dean was about to recommence when i advanced and recognizing me directly she jumped to her feet crying 
 why bless you mr lockwood how could you think of returning in this way shut up at thrushcross grange you should have given us notice 
 arranged to be accommodated there for as long as i shall stay i answered i depart again tomorrow and how are you transplanted here mrs dean tell me that 
 zillah left and mr heathcliff wished me to come soon after you went to london and stay till you returned but step in pray have you walked from gimmerton this evening 
 from the grange i replied and while they make me lodging room there i want to finish my business with your master because i think of having another opportunity in a hurry 
 what business sir said nelly conducting me into the house gone out at present and return soon 
 about the rent i answered 
 oh then it is with mrs heathcliff you must settle she observed or rather with me she has not learnt to manage her affairs yet and i act for her nobody else 
 i looked surprised 
 ah you have not heard of death i see she continued 
 heathcliff dead i exclaimed astonished how long ago 
 three months since but sit down and let me take your hat and tell you all about it stop you have had nothing to eat have you 
 i want nothing i have ordered supper at home you sit down too i never dreamt of his dying let me hear how it came to pass you say you expect them back for some young people 
 have to scold them every evening for their late rambles but they care for me at least have a drink of our old ale it will do you good you seem weary 
 she hastened to fetch it before i could refuse and i heard joseph asking whether it a crying scandal that she should have fellies at her time of life and then to get them jocks out uh t cellar he fair shaamed to bide still and see it 
 she did not stay to retaliate but in a minute bearing a reaming silver pint whose contents i lauded with becoming earnestness and afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of heathcliffs history he had a queer end as she expressed it 
 i was summoned to wuthering heights within a fortnight of your leaving us she said and i obeyed joyfully for sake my first interview with her grieved and shocked me she had altered so much since our separation mr heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here he only told me he wanted me and he was tired of seeing catherine i must make the little parlour my and keep her with me it was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day she seemed pleased at this arrangement and by degrees i smuggled over a great number of books and other articles that had formed her amusement at the grange and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort the delusion did not last long catherine contented at first in a brief space grew irritable and restless for one thing she was forbidden to move out of the garden and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on for another in following the house i was forced to quit her frequently and she complained of loneliness she preferred quarrelling with joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude i did not mind their skirmishes but hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also when the master wanted to have the house to himself and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach or quietly joined in my occupations and shunned remarking or addressing though he was always as sullen and silent as a while she changed her behaviour and became incapable of letting him alone talking at him commenting on his stupidity and idleness expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing 
 just like a dog is he not ellen she once observed or a carthorse he does his work eats his food and sleeps eternally what a blank dreary mind he must have do you ever dream hareton and if you do what is it about but you speak to me 
 then she looked at him but he would neither open his mouth nor look again 
 perhaps dreaming now she continued he twitched his shoulder as juno twitches hers ask him ellen 
 mr hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs if you behave i said he had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist as if tempted to use it 
 i know why hareton never speaks when i am in the kitchen she exclaimed on another occasion he is afraid i shall laugh at him ellen what do you think he began to teach himself to read once and because i laughed he burned his books and dropped it was he not a fool 
 were not you naughty i said answer me that 
 perhaps i was she went on but i did not expect him to be so silly hareton if i gave you a book would you take it now try 
 she placed one she had been perusing on his hand he flung it off and muttered if she did not give over he would break her neck 
 well i shall put it here she said in the table drawer and going to bed 
 then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it and departed but he would not come near it and so i informed her in the morning to her great disappointment i saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself she had done it effectually but her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury while i ironed or pursued other stationary employments i could not well do in the parlour she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me when hareton was there she generally paused in an interesting part and left the book lying about that she did repeatedly but he was as obstinate as a mule and instead of snatching at her bait in wet weather he took to smoking with joseph and they sat like automatons one on each side of the fire the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense as he would have called it the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it on fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions and catherine yawned and sighed and teased me to talk to her and ran off into the court or garden the moment i began and as a last resource cried and said she was tired of living her life was useless 
 mr heathcliff who grew more and more disinclined to society had almost banished earnshaw out of his apartment owing to an accident at the commencement of march he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen his gun burst while out on the hills by himself a splinter cut his arm and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home the consequence was that perforce he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity till he made it up again it suited catherine to have him there at any rate it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever and she would compel me to find out business below that she might accompany me 
 on easter monday joseph went to gimmerton fair with some cattle and in the afternoon i was busy getting up linen in the kitchen earnshaw sat morose as usual at the and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window panes varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs and whispered ejaculations and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin who steadfastly smoked and looked into the grate at a notice that i could do with her no longer intercepting my light she removed to the hearthstone i bestowed little attention on her proceedings but presently i heard her begin 
 found out hareton that i i should like you to be my cousin now if you had not grown so cross to me and so rough 
 hareton returned no answer 
 hareton hareton hareton do you hear she continued get off wi ye he growled with uncompromising gruffness 
 let me take that pipe she said cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth 
 before he could attempt to recover it it was broken and behind the fire he swore at her and seized another 
 stop she cried you must listen to me first and i speak while those clouds are floating in my face 
 will you go to the devil he exclaimed ferociously and let me be 
 no she persisted i i tell what to do to make you talk to me and you are determined not to understand when i call you stupid i mean anything i mean that i despise you come you shall take notice of me hareton you are my cousin and you shall own me 
 i shall have naught to do wi you and your mucky pride and your damned mocking tricks he answered go to hell body and soul before i look sideways after you again side out o t gait now this minute 
 catherine frowned and retreated to the chewing her lip and endeavouring by humming an eccentric tune to conceal a growing tendency to sob 
 you should be friends with your cousin mr hareton i interrupted since she repents of her sauciness it would do you a great deal of good it would make you another man to have her for a companion 
 a companion he cried when she hates me and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon nay if it made me a king not be scorned for seeking her goodwill any more 
 it is not i who hate you it is you who hate me wept cathy no longer disguising her trouble you hate me as much as mr heathcliff does and more 
 a damned liar began earnshaw why have i made him angry by taking your part then a hundred times and that when you sneered at and despised me on plaguing me and step in yonder and say you worried me out of the kitchen 
 i know you took my part she answered drying her eyes and i was miserable and bitter at everybody but now i thank you and beg you to forgive me what can i do besides 
 she returned to the hearth and frankly extended her hand he blackened and scowled like a thunder cloud and kept his fists resolutely clenched and his gaze fixed on the ground catherine by instinct must have divined it was obdurate perversity and not dislike that prompted this dogged conduct for after remaining an instant undecided she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss the little rogue thought i had not seen her and drawing back she took her former station by the window quite demurely i shook my head reprovingly and then she blushed and whispered 
 well what should i have done ellen he shake hands and he look i must show him some way that i like i want to be friends 
 whether the kiss convinced hareton i cannot tell he was very careful for some minutes that his face should not be seen and when he did raise it he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes 
 catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper and having tied it with a bit of ribband and addressed it to mr hareton earnshaw she desired me to be her ambassadress and convey the present to its destined recipient 
 and tell him if take it come and teach him to read it right she said and if he refuse it go upstairs and never tease him again 
 i carried it and repeated the message anxiously watched by my employer hareton would not open his fingers so i laid it on his knee he did not strike off either i returned to my work catherine leaned her head and arms on the table till she heard the slightest rustle of the covering being removed then she stole away and quietly seated herself beside her cousin he trembled and his face glowed all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him he could not summon courage at first to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look and her murmured petition 
 say you forgive me hareton do you can make me so happy by speaking that little word 
 he muttered something inaudible 
 and be my friend added catherine interrogatively 
 nay be ashamed of me every day of your life he answered and the more the more you know me and i cannot bide it 
 so you be my friend she said smiling as sweet as honey and creeping close up 
 i overheard no further distinguishable talk but on looking round again i perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book that i did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides and the enemies were thenceforth sworn allies 
 the work they studied was full of costly pictures and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till joseph came home he poor man was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of catherine seated on the same bench with hareton earnshaw leaning her hand on his shoulder and confounded at his endurance of her proximity it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night his emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew as he solemnly spread his large bible on the table and overlaid it with dirty from his the produce of the transactions at length he summoned hareton from his seat 
 tak these in tuh t maister lad he said un bide thar gang up tuh my awn rahm this norther mensful nor seemly fur us we mun side aht and seearch another 
 come catherine i said we must side out too done my ironing are you ready to go 
 it is not eight she answered rising unwillingly hareton leave this book upon the and bring some more tomorrow 
 ony books ut yah leave aw suall tak intuh th hahse said joseph un be mitch if yah find em agean soa yah muh plase yourseln 
 cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers and smiling as she passed hareton went singing upstairs lighter of heart i venture to say than ever she had been under that roof before except perhaps during her earliest visits to linton 
 the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly though it encountered temporary interruptions earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish and my young lady was no philosopher and no paragon of patience but both their minds tending to the same loving and desiring to esteem and the other loving and desiring to be contrived in the end to reach it 
 you see mr lockwood it was easy enough to win mrs heart but now glad you did not try the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two i shall envy no one on their wedding day there be a happier woman than myself in england

 chapter 
 
 
 this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north and on my journey to his abode i unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of gimmerton the ostler at a roadside public house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very green oats newly reaped passed by and he remarked 
 frough gimmerton nah allas three wick after other folk wi ther harvest 
 gimmerton i residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy ah i know how far is it from this 
 happen fourteen mile th hills and a rough road he answered 
 a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross grange it was scarcely noon and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn besides i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again having rested a while i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village and with great fatigue to our beasts we managed the distance in some three hours 
 i left him there and proceeded down the valley alone the grey church looked greyer and the lonely churchyard lonelier i distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves it was sweet warm warm for travelling but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below had i seen it nearer august sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes in winter nothing more dreary in summer nothing more divine than those glens shut in by hills and those bluff bold swells of heath 
 i reached the grange before sunset and knocked for admittance but the family had retreated into the back premises i judged by one thin blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney and they did not hear i rode into the court under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting and an old woman reclined on the house steps smoking a meditative pipe 
 is mrs dean within i demanded of the dame 
 mistress dean nay she answered shoo bide here up at th heights 
 are you the housekeeper then i continued 
 ea aw keep th house she replied 
 well mr lockwood the master are there any rooms to lodge me in i wonder i wish to stay here all night 
 t maister she cried in astonishment whet whoiver knew yah wur coming yah sud ha send word nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t place nowt there 
 she threw down her pipe and bustled in the girl followed and i entered too soon perceiving that her report was true and moreover that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition i bid her be composed i would go out for a walk and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a for me to sup in and a bedroom to sleep in no sweeping and dusting only good fire and dry sheets were necessary she seemed willing to do her best though she thrust the into the grates in mistake for the poker and malappropriated several other articles of her craft but i retired confiding in her energy for a against my return wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion an afterthought brought me back when i had quitted the court 
 all well at the heights i inquired of the woman 
 eea owt ee knaw she answered skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders 
 i would have asked why mrs dean had deserted the grange but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis so i turned away and made my exit rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind and the mild glory of a rising moon in fading and the other i quitted the park and climbed the stony branching off to mr dwelling before i arrived in sight of it all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west but i could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass by that splendid moon i had neither to climb the gate nor to yielded to my hand that is an improvement i thought and i noticed another by the aid of my nostrils a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit trees 
 both doors and lattices were open and yet as is usually the case in a coal district a fine red fire illumined the chimney the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered and looked and listened in consequence being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as i lingered 
 said a voice as sweet as a silver for the third time you dunce not going to tell you again recollect or pull your hair 
 contrary then answered another in deep but softened tones and now kiss me for minding so well 
 no read it over first correctly without a single mistake 
 the male speaker began to read he was a young man respectably dressed and seated at a table having a book before him his handsome features glowed with pleasure and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention its owner stood behind her light shining ringlets blending at intervals with his brown locks as she bent to superintend his studies and her was lucky he could not see her face or he would never have been so steady i could and i bit my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiling beauty 
 the task was done not free from further blunders but the pupil claimed a reward and received at least five kisses which however he generously returned then they came to the door and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors i supposed i should be condemned in hareton heart if not by his mouth to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then and feeling very mean and malignant i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen there was unobstructed admittance on that side also and at the door sat my old friend nelly dean sewing and singing a song which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance uttered in far from musical accents

 no or we should be sitting in flaming fagots i suppose retorted the singer but wisht old man and read your bible like a christian and never mind me this is fairy bonny goes to a dance 
 mrs dean was about to recommence when i advanced and recognizing me directly she jumped to her feet crying

 she sits alone a good deal and talk to her father as much as she used i found her crying over the babies the other day when she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then i see a look in her face that i understand this like beth and it worries me 
 have you asked her about it 
 i have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that i stopped i never force my confidence and i seldom have to wait for long 
 mrs march glanced at jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute jo said i think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them why mother eighteen but we realize it and treat her like a child forgetting a woman 
 so she is dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile 
 be helped marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one i promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you 
 a great comfort jo i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone beth is too feeble and amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready 
 why you know i mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family amy is splendid in fine works and not but i feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home your man 
 i leave beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her jo sooner than to anyone else be very kind and let her think anyone watches or talks about her if she only would get quite strong and cheerful again i have a wish in the world 
 happy woman got heaps 
 my dear what are they 
 settle troubles and then tell you mine they are not very wearing so keep and jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her heart at rest about her for the present at least 
 while apparently absorbed in her own affairs jo watched beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon when she and beth were alone together yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet sitting at the window work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out all serene coming in tonight 
 beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks 
 hum said jo still intent upon her face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge beth whisked it off and in her face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper 
 mercy on me beth loves laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made i never dreamed of such a thing what will mother say i wonder if her there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought if he love back again how dreadful it would be he must make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous looking boy laughing at her from the wall oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance meg married and a mamma amy flourishing away at paris and beth in love the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite no thank you sir very charming but no more stability than a weathercock so you write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it do a bit of good and i have it 
 then she sighed and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations which only confirmed her suspicion though laurie flirted with amy and joked with jo his manner to beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle but so was therefore no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others indeed a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that our boy was getting fonder than ever of jo who however hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it if they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying i told you so but jo hated philandering and allow it always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger when laurie first went to college he fell in love about once a month but these small flames were as brief as ardent did no damage and much amused jo who took great interest in the alternations of hop despair and resignation which were confided to her in their weekly conferences but there came a time when laurie ceased to worship at many shrines hinted darkly at one passion and indulged occasionally in byronic fits of gloom then he avoided the tender subject altogether wrote philosophical notes to jo turned studious and gave out that he was going to dig intending to graduate in a blaze of glory this suited the young lady better than twilight confidences tender pressures of the hand and eloquent glances of the eye for with jo brain developed earlier than heart and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable 
 things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before if she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that beth was very quiet and laurie very kind to her but having given the rein to her lively fancy it galloped away with her at a great pace and common sense being rather weakened by a long course or romance writing did not come to the rescue as usual beth lay on the sofa and laurie sat in a low chair close by amusing her with all sorts of gossip for she depended on her weekly spin and he never disappointed her but that evening jo fancied that eyes rested on the lively dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match though the phrases caught off a tice stumped off his ground and the leg hit for three were as intelligible to her as sanskrit she also fancied having set her heart upon seeing it that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in manner that he dropped his voice now and then laughed less than usual was a little and settled the afghan over feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender 
 who knows stranger things have happened thought jo as she fussed about the room she will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other i see how he can help it and i do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way 
 as everyone was out of the way but herself jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed but where should she go and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point 
 now the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a broad and low a trifle shabby as well it might be for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies fished over the back rode on the arms and had menageries under it as children and rested tired heads dreamed dreams and listened to tender talk on it as young women they all loved it for it was a family refuge and one corner had always been favorite lounging place among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one hard round covered with prickly horsehair and furnished with a knobby button at each end this repulsive pillow was her especial property being used as a weapon of defense a barricade or a stern preventive of too much slumber 
 laurie knew this pillow well and had cause to regard it with deep aversion having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next ot jo in the sofa corner if the sausage as the called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to man woman or child who dared disturb it that evening jo forgot to barricade her corner and had not been in her seat five minutes before a massive form appeared beside her and with both arms spread over the sofa back both long legs stretched out before him laurie exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction 
 now this is filling at the price 
 no slang snapped jo slamming down the pillow but it was too late there was no room for it and coasting onto the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner 
 come jo be thorny after studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it 
 beth will pet you busy 
 no not to be bothered with me but you like that sort 
 of thing unless suddenly lost your taste for it have you 
 do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him 
 anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but jo quenched her boy by turning on him with a stern query how many bouquets have you sent miss randal this week 
 not one upon my word engaged now then 
 glad of it one of your foolish extravagances sending flowers and things to girls for whom you care two pins continued jo reprovingly 
 sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins let me send them flowers and things so what can i do my feelings need a vent 
 mother approve of flirting even in fun and you do flirt desperately teddy 
 give anything if i could answer so do you as i merely say that i see any harm in that pleasant little game if all parties understand that only play 
 well it does look pleasant but i learn how done tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else id doing but i seem to get on said jo forgetting to play mentor 
 take lessons of amy she has a regular talent for it 
 yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far i suppose natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place 
 glad you flirt really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate ashamed of them they mean any harm sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward mend their ways i fancy 
 they do the same and as their tongues are the sharpest you fellows get the worst of it for you are as silly as they every bit if you behaved properly they would but knowing you like their nonsense they keep it up and then you blame them 
 much you know about it said laurie in a superior tone we like romps and flirts though we may act as if we did sometimes the pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentleman bless your innocent soul if you could be in my place for a month see things that would astonish you a trifle upon my word when i see one of those girls i always want to say with our friend cock robin 
 out upon you fie upon you jig 
 it was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples jo knew that young laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoiled and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice if you must have a went teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones 
 you really advise it and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face 
 yes i do but better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime not half good enough whoever the modest girl may be and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her 
 that not acquiesced laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound apron tassel round his finger 
 mercy on us this will never do thought jo adding aloud go and sing to me dying for some music and always like yours 
 rather stay here thank you 
 well you there room go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental i thought you hated to be tied to a apron string retorted jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own 
 ah that depends on who wears the apron and laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel 
 are you going demanded jo diving for the pillow 
 he fled at once and the minute it was well up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon 
 jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to bedside with the anxious inquiry what is it dear 
 i thought you were asleep sobbed beth 
 is it the old pain my precious 
 no a new one but i can bear it and beth tried to check her tears 
 tell me all about it and let me cure it as i often did the other 
 you there is no cure there voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that jo was frightened 
 where is it shall i call mother 
 no no call her tell her i shall be better soon lie down here and poor my head be quiet and go to sleep indeed i will jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak but young as she was jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of new pain she only said in her tenderest tone does anything trouble you deary 
 yes jo after a long pause 
 it comfort you to tell me what it is 
 not now not yet 
 then i ask but remember bethy that mother and jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can 
 i know it tell you 
 is the pain better now 
 oh yes much better you are so comfortable jo 
 go to sleep dear stay with you 
 so cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills 
 but jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother 
 you asked me the other day what my wishes were tell you one of them marmee she began as they sat along together i want to go away somewhere this winter for a change 
 why jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning 
 with her eyes on her work jo answered soberly i want something new i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am i brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as i can be spared this winter like to hop a little way and try my wings 
 where will you hop 
 to new york i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it you know mrs kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew rather hard to find just the thing but i think i should suit if i tried 
 my dear go out to service in that great boarding house and mrs march looked surprised but not displeased 
 not exactly going out to service for mrs kirke is your kindest soul that ever would make things pleasant for me i know her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there care if they do honest work and not ashamed of it 
 nor i but your writing 
 all the better for the change i shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if i much time there i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish 
 i have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy 
 no mother 
 may i know the others 
 jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks it may be vain and wrong to say it is getting too fond of me 
 then you care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and mrs march looked anxious as she put the question 
 mercy no i love the dear boy as i always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more out of the question 
 glad of that jo 
 why please 
 because dear i think you suited to one another as friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life you are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love 
 just the feeling i had though i express it glad you think he is only beginning to care for me it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for i fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could i 
 you are sure of his feeling for you 
 the color deepened in cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers afraid it is so mother he said anything but he looks a great deal i think i had better go away before it comes to anything 
 i agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go 
 jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling how mrs moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that annie may still hope 
 ah jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in desire to see their children happy meg is so and i am content with her success you i leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her for beth i indulge no hopes except that she may be well by the way she seems brighter this last day or two have you spoken to her 
 yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me i said no more for i think i know it and jo told her little story 
 mrs march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for sake jo should go away for a time 
 let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic beth must think going to please myself as i am for i talk about laurie to her but she can pet and comfort him after gone and so cure him of this romantic notion been through so many little trials of the sort used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity 
 jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore 
 the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for mrs kirke gladly accepted jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her the teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly he had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly so i am and i mean this one shall stay turned 
 jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heart for beth seemed more cheerful and hoped she was doing the best for all 
 one thing i leave in your especial care she said the night before she left 
 you mean your papers asked beth no my boy be very good to him you 
 of course i will but i fill your place and miss you sadly 
 it hurt him so remember i leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order 
 do my best for your sake promised beth wondering why jo looked at her so queerly 
 when laurie said he whispered significantly it do a bit of good jo my eye is on you so mind what you do or come and bring you home

 jo anxious about beth 
 why mother she has seemed unusually well since the babies came 
 not her health that troubles me now her spirits sure there is something on her mind and i want you to discover what it is 
 what makes you think so mother 
 she sits alone a good deal and talk to her father as much as she used i found her crying over the babies the other day when she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then i see a look in her face that i understand this like beth and it worries me 
 have you asked her about it 
 i have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that i stopped i never force my confidence and i seldom have to wait for long 
 mrs march glanced at jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute jo said i think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them why mother eighteen but we realize it and treat her like a child forgetting a woman 
 so she is dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile 
 be helped marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one i promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you 
 a great comfort jo i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone beth is too feeble and amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready 
 why you know i mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family amy is splendid in fine works and not but i feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home your man 
 i leave beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her jo sooner than to anyone else be very kind and let her think anyone watches or talks about her if she only would get quite strong and cheerful again i have a wish in the world 
 happy woman got heaps 
 my dear what are they 
 settle troubles and then tell you mine they are not very wearing so keep and jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her heart at rest about her for the present at least 
 while apparently absorbed in her own affairs jo watched beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon when she and beth were alone together yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet sitting at the window work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out all serene coming in tonight 
 beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks 
 hum said jo still intent upon her face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge beth whisked it off and in her face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper 
 mercy on me beth loves laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made i never dreamed of such a thing what will mother say i wonder if her there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought if he love back again how dreadful it would be he must make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous looking boy laughing at her from the wall oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance meg married and a mamma amy flourishing away at paris and beth in love the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite no thank you sir very charming but no more stability than a weathercock so you write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it do a bit of good and i have it

 who knows stranger things have happened thought jo as she fussed about the room she will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other i see how he can help it and i do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way 
 as everyone was out of the way but herself jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed but where should she go and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point

 now this is filling at the price 
 no slang snapped jo slamming down the pillow but it was too late there was no room for it and coasting onto the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner 
 come jo be thorny after studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it 
 beth will pet you busy 
 no not to be bothered with me but you like that sort 
 of thing unless suddenly lost your taste for it have you 
 do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him 
 anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but jo quenched her boy by turning on him with a stern query how many bouquets have you sent miss randal this week 
 not one upon my word engaged now then 
 glad of it one of your foolish extravagances sending flowers and things to girls for whom you care two pins continued jo reprovingly 
 sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins let me send them flowers and things so what can i do my feelings need a vent

 well it does look pleasant but i learn how done tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else id doing but i seem to get on said jo forgetting to play mentor 
 take lessons of amy she has a regular talent for it 
 yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far i suppose natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place 
 glad you flirt really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate ashamed of them they mean any harm sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward mend their ways i fancy

 it was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples jo knew that young laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoiled and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice if you must have a went teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones 
 you really advise it and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face 
 yes i do but better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime not half good enough whoever the modest girl may be and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her 
 that not acquiesced laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound apron tassel round his finger 
 mercy on us this will never do thought jo adding aloud go and sing to me dying for some music and always like yours 
 rather stay here thank you 
 well you there room go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental i thought you hated to be tied to a apron string retorted jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own 
 ah that depends on who wears the apron and laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel 
 are you going demanded jo diving for the pillow 
 he fled at once and the minute it was well up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon 
 jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to bedside with the anxious inquiry what is it dear 
 i thought you were asleep sobbed beth 
 is it the old pain my precious 
 no a new one but i can bear it and beth tried to check her tears 
 tell me all about it and let me cure it as i often did the other 
 you there is no cure there voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that jo was frightened 
 where is it shall i call mother 
 no no call her tell her i shall be better soon lie down here and poor my head be quiet and go to sleep indeed i will jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak but young as she was jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of new pain she only said in her tenderest tone does anything trouble you deary 
 yes jo after a long pause 
 it comfort you to tell me what it is 
 not now not yet 
 then i ask but remember bethy that mother and jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can 
 i know it tell you 
 is the pain better now 
 oh yes much better you are so comfortable jo 
 go to sleep dear stay with you 
 so cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills 
 but jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother 
 you asked me the other day what my wishes were tell you one of them marmee she began as they sat along together i want to go away somewhere this winter for a change 
 why jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning 
 with her eyes on her work jo answered soberly i want something new i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am i brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as i can be spared this winter like to hop a little way and try my wings 
 where will you hop 
 to new york i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it you know mrs kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew rather hard to find just the thing but i think i should suit if i tried 
 my dear go out to service in that great boarding house and mrs march looked surprised but not displeased 
 not exactly going out to service for mrs kirke is your kindest soul that ever would make things pleasant for me i know her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there care if they do honest work and not ashamed of it 
 nor i but your writing 
 all the better for the change i shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if i much time there i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish 
 i have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy 
 no mother 
 may i know the others 
 jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks it may be vain and wrong to say it is getting too fond of me 
 then you care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and mrs march looked anxious as she put the question 
 mercy no i love the dear boy as i always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more out of the question 
 glad of that jo 
 why please 
 because dear i think you suited to one another as friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life you are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love 
 just the feeling i had though i express it glad you think he is only beginning to care for me it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for i fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could i 
 you are sure of his feeling for you 
 the color deepened in cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers afraid it is so mother he said anything but he looks a great deal i think i had better go away before it comes to anything 
 i agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go 
 jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling how mrs moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that annie may still hope 
 ah jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in desire to see their children happy meg is so and i am content with her success you i leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her for beth i indulge no hopes except that she may be well by the way she seems brighter this last day or two have you spoken to her 
 yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me i said no more for i think i know it and jo told her little story 
 mrs march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for sake jo should go away for a time 
 let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic beth must think going to please myself as i am for i talk about laurie to her but she can pet and comfort him after gone and so cure him of this romantic notion been through so many little trials of the sort used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity 
 jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore 
 the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for mrs kirke gladly accepted jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her the teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly he had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly so i am and i mean this one shall stay turned 
 jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heart for beth seemed more cheerful and hoped she was doing the best for all 
 one thing i leave in your especial care she said the night before she left 
 you mean your papers asked beth no my boy be very good to him you 
 of course i will but i fill your place and miss you sadly 
 it hurt him so remember i leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order 
 do my best for your sake promised beth wondering why jo looked at her so queerly 
 when laurie said he whispered significantly it do a bit of good jo my eye is on you so mind what you do or come and bring you home

lionfish nov chapter flesh blood and bonecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt his feet slam into the ground his injured leg gave way and he fell forward his hand let go of the triwizard cup at last he raised his head 
 
 where are we he said 
 
 cedric shook his head he got up pulled harry to his feet and they looked around 
 
 they had left the hogwarts grounds completely they had obviously traveled miles perhaps hundreds of miles for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone they were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right a hill rose above them to their left harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside 
 
 cedric looked down at the triwizard cup and then up at harry 
 
 did anyone tell you the cup was a portkey he asked 
 
 nope said harry he was looking around the graveyard it was completely silent and slightly eerie is this supposed to be part of the task 
 
 i dunno said cedric he sounded slightly nervous wands out reckon 
 
 yeah said harry glad that cedric had made the suggestion rather than him 
 
 they pulled out their wands harry kept looking around him he had yet again the strange feeling that they were being watched 
 
 coming he said suddenly 
 
 squinting tensely through the darkness they watched the figure drawing nearer walking steadily toward them between the graves harry make out a face but from the way it was walking and holding its arms he could tell that it was carrying something whoever it was he was short and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face and several paces nearer the gap between them closing all the time harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a babyor was it merely a bundle of robes 
 
 harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at cedric cedric shot him a quizzical look they both turned back to watch the approaching figure 
 
 it stopped beside a towering marble headstone only six feet from them for a second harry and cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another 
 
 and then without warning scar exploded with pain it was agony such as he had never felt in all his life his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face his knees buckled he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all his head was about to split open 
 
 from far away above his head he heard a high cold voice say kill the spare 
 
 a swishing noise and a second voice which screeched the words to the night avada kedavra 
 
 a blast of green light blazed through eyelids and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched and then it diminished terrified of what he was about to see he opened his stinging eyes 
 
 cedric was lying on the ground beside him he was dead 
 
 for a second that contained an eternity harry stared into face at his open gray eyes blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house at his mouth which looked slightly surprised and then before mind had accepted what he was seeing before he could feel anything but numb disbelief he felt himself being pulled to his feet 
 
 the short man in the cloak had put down his bundle lit his wand and was dragging harry toward the marble headstone harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it 
 
 tom riddle 
 the cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around harry tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone harry could hear shallow fast breathing from the depths of the hood he struggled and the man hit him hit him with a hand that had a finger missing and harry realized who was under the hood it was wormtail 
 
 you he gasped 
 
 but wormtail who had finished conjuring the ropes did not reply he was busy checking the tightness of the cords his fingers trembling uncontrollably fumbling over the knots once sure that harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he move an inch wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into mouth then without a word he turned from harry and hurried away harry make a sound nor could he see where wormtail had gone he turn his head to see beyond the headstone he could see only what was right in front of him 
 
 body was lying some twenty feet away some way beyond him glinting in the starlight lay the triwizard cup wand was on the ground at feet the bundle of robes that harry had thought was a baby was close by at the foot of the grave it seemed to be stirring fretfully harry watched it and his scar seared with pain againand he suddenly knew that he want to see what was in those robeshe want that bundle opened 
 
 he could hear noises at his feet he looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass circling the headstone where he was tied fast wheezy breathing was growing louder again it sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground then he came back within range of vision and harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave it was full of what seemed to be water harry could hear it slopping around and it was larger than any cauldron harry had ever used a great stone belly large enough for a man to sit in 
 
 the thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently as though it was trying to free itself now wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand suddenly there were crackling names beneath it the large snake slithered away into the darkness 
 
 the liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast the surface began not only to bubble but to send out fiery sparks as though it were on fire steam was thickening blurring the outline of wormtail tending the fire the movements beneath the robes became more agitated and harry heard the high cold voice again 
 
 hurry 
 
 the whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now it might have been encrusted with diamonds 
 
 it is ready master 
 
 now said the cold voice 
 
 wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground revealing what was inside them and harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth 
 
 it was as though wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly slimy and blind but worse a hundred times worse the thing wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child except that harry had never seen anything less like a child it was hairless and a dark raw reddish black its arms and legs were thin and feeble and its face no child alive ever had a face like that flat and snakelike with gleaming red eyes 
 
 the thing seemed almost helpless it raised its thin arms put them around neck and wormtail lifted it as he did so his hood fell back and harry saw the look of revulsion on weak pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron for one moment harry saw the evil flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion and then wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron there was a hiss and it vanished below the surface harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud 
 
 let it drown harry thought his scar burning almost past endurance pleaselet it drown 
 
 wormtail was speaking his voice shook he seemed frightened beyond his wits he raised his wand closed his eyes and spoke to the night 
 
 bone of the father unknowingly given you will renew your son 
 
 the surface of the grave at feet cracked horrified harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at command and fell softly into the cauldron the diamond surface of the water broke and hissed it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid blue 
 
 and now wormtail was whimpering he pulled a long thin shining silver dagger from inside his cloak his voice broke into petrified sobs 
 
 flesh of the servant given you will revive your master 
 
 he stretched his right hand out in front of him the hand with the missing finger he gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward 
 
 harry realized what wormtail was about to do a second before it happened he closed his eyes as tightly as he could but he could not block the scream that pierced the night that went through harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too he heard something fall to the ground heard anguished panting then a sickening splash as something was dropped into the cauldron harry stand to lookbut the potion had turned a burning red the light of it shone through closed eyelids 
 
 wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony not until harry felt anguished breath on his face did he realize that wormtail was right in front of him 
 
 of the enemyforcibly takenyou willresurrect your foe 
 
 harry could do nothing to prevent it he was tied too down struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in remaining hand he felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes wormtail still panting with pain rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to cut so that a dribble of blood fell into it 
 
 he staggered back to the cauldron with blood he poured it inside the liquid within turned instantly a blinding white wormtail his job done dropped to his knees beside the cauldron then slumped sideways and lay on the ground cradling the bleeding stump of his arm gasping and sobbing 
 
 the cauldron was simmering sending its diamond sparks in all directions so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness nothing happened 
 
 let it have drowned harry thought let it have gone wrong 
 
 and then suddenly the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished a surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead obliterating everything in front of harry so that he see wormtail or cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the gone wrong he drowned pleaseplease let it be dead 
 
 but then through the mist in front of him he saw with an icy surge of terror the dark outline of a man tall and skeletally thin rising slowly from inside the cauldron 
 
 robe me said the high cold voice from behind the steam and wormtail sobbing and moaning still cradling his mutilated arm scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground got to his feet reached up and pulled them over his head 
 
 the thin man stepped out of the cauldron staring at harryand harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years whiter than a skull with wide livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils

lionfish nov chapter out of the firecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 not going i need the hospital wing i want 
 
 he was gibbering as he tried to pull away from professor tofty who was looking at harry with much concern after helping him out into the entrance hall with the students all around them staring 
 
 fine sir harry stammered wiping the sweat from his face really i just fell asleep had a nightmare 
 
 pressure of examinations said the old wizard sympathetically patting harry shakily on the shoulder it happens young man it happens now a cooling drink of water and perhaps you will be ready to return to the great hall the examination is nearly over but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely 
 
 yes said harry wildly i mean no donedone as much as i can i think 
 
 very well very well said the old wizard gently i shall go and collect your examination paper and i suggest that you go and have a nice lie down 
 
 do that said harry nodding vigorously thanks very much 
 
 the second that the old heels disappeared over the threshold into the great hall harry ran up the marble staircase hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches up more flights of stairs and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing causing madam pomfreywho had been spooning some bright blue liquid into open mouthto shriek in alarm 
 
 potter what do you think doing 
 
 i need to see professor mcgonagall gasped harry the breath tearing his lungs now urgent 
 
 not here potter said madam pomfrey sadly she was transferred to st this morning four stunning spells straight to the chest at her age a wonder they kill her 
 
 gone said harry shocked 
 
 the bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him he remained quite still looking at madam pomfrey terror was rising inside him 
 
 there was nobody left to tell dumbledore had gone hagrid had gone but he had always expected professor mcgonagall to be there irascible and inflexible perhaps but always dependably solidly present 
 
 i wonder shocked potter said madam pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face as if one of them could have stunned minerva mcgonagall by daylight cowardice what it was despicable cowardice if i worried what would happen to you students without me resign in protest 
 
 yes said harry blankly 
 
 he wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood buffeted by the crowd panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do 
 
 ron and hermione said a voice in his head 
 
 he was running again pushing students out of the way oblivious to their angry protests he sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him 
 
 harry said hermione at once looking very frightened what happened are you all right are you ill 
 
 where have you been demanded ron 
 
 come with me harry said quickly come on got to tell you something 
 
 he led them along the corridor peering through doorways and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived closing the door behind ron and hermione the moment they were inside and leaned against it facing them 
 
 voldemorts got sirius 
 
 what 
 
 how 
 
 saw it just now when i fell asleep in the exam 
 
 butbut where how said hermione whose face was white 
 
 i dunno how said harry but i know exactly where a room in the department of mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and at the end of row trying to use sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there torturing him says end by killing him 
 
 harry found his voice was shaking as were his knees he moved over to a desk and sat down on it trying to master himself 
 
 we going to get there he asked them 
 
 there was a silence then ron said there 
 
 get to the department of mysteries so we can rescue sirius harry said loudly 
 
 butharry said ron weakly 
 
 what what said harry 
 
 he could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable 
 
 harry said hermione in a rather frightened voice er how how did voldemort get into the ministry of magic without anybody realising he was there 
 
 how do i know bellowed harry the question is how going to get in there 
 
 but harry think about this said hermione taking a step towards him five in the afternoon the ministry of magic must be full of workers how would voldemort and sirius have got in without being seen harry probably the two most wanted wizards in the world you think they could get into a building full of aurors undetected 
 
 i dunno voldemort used an invisibility cloak or something harry shouted anyway the department of mysteries has always been completely empty whenever been 
 
 never been there harry said hermione quietly dreamed about the place all 
 
 not normal dreams harry shouted in her face standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn he wanted to shake her how explain dad then what was all that about how come i knew what had happened to him 
 
 got a point said ron quietly looking at hermione 
 
 but this is just just so unlikely said hermione desperately harry how on earth could voldemort have got hold of sirius when been in grimmauld place all the time 
 
 sirius cracked and just wanted some fresh air said ron sounding worried been desperate to get out of that house for ages 
 
 but why hermione persisted why on earth would voldemort want to use sirius to get the weapon or whatever the thing is 
 
 i dunno there could be loads of reasons harry yelled at her maybe sirius is just someone voldemort care about seeing hurt 
 
 you know what just thought of something said ron in a hushed voice brother was a death eater he maybe he told sirius the secret of how to get the weapon 
 
 yeahand why been so keen to keep sirius locked up all the time said harry 
 
 look sorry cried hermione but neither of you is making sense and got no proof for any of this no proof voldemort and sirius are even there 
 
 hermione seen them said ron rounding on her 
 
 ok she said looking frightened yet determined just got to say this 
 
 what 
 
 you this a criticism harry but you do sort of i you think got a bit of thing she said 
 
 he glared at her 
 
 and that supposed to mean a thing 
 
 well you she looked more apprehensive than ever i mean last year for instance in the lake during the tournament you have i mean you need to save that little delacour girl you got a bit carried away 
 
 a wave of hot prickly anger swept through body now could she remind him of that blunder now 
 
 i mean it was really great of you and everything said hermione quickly looking positively petrified at the look on face everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do 
 
 funny said harry through gritted teeth because i definitely remember ron saying wasted time acting the hero is that what you think this is you reckon i want to act the hero again 
 
 no no no said hermione looking aghast not what i mean at all 
 
 well spit out what got to say because wasting time here harry shouted 
 
 trying to say voldemort knows you harry he took ginny down into the chamber of secrets to lure you there the kind of thing he does he knows thethe sort of person go to aid what if just trying to get you into the department of myst 
 
 hermione it matter if done it to get me there or taken mcgonagall to st there anyone from the order left at hogwarts who we can tell and if we go sirius is dead 
 
 but harrywhat if your dream waswas just that a dream 
 
 harry let out a roar of frustration hermione actually stepped back from him looking alarmed 
 
 you get it harry shouted at her not having nightmares not just dreaming what think all the occlumency was for why think dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things because real hermionesirius is trapped seen him got him and no one else knows and that means the only ones who can save him and if you want to do it fine but going understand and if i remember rightly you have a problem with my thing when it was you i was saving from the dementors orhe rounded on ronwhen it was your sister i was saving from the basilisk 
 
 i never said i had a problem said ron heatedly 
 
 but harry just said it said hermione fiercely dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind if done occlumency properly never have seen this 
 
 if you think just going to act like i seen 
 
 sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind 
 
 well i expect say something different if he knew what just 
 
 the classroom door opened harry ron and hermione whipped around ginny walked in looking curious closely followed by luna who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally 
 
 hi said ginny uncertainly we recognised voice what are you yelling about 
 
 never you mind said harry roughly 
 
 ginny raised her eyebrows 
 
 no need to take that tone with me she said coolly i was only wondering whether i could help 
 
 well you said harry shortly 
 
 being rather rude you know said luna serenely 
 
 harry swore and turned away the very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with luna lovegood 
 
 wait said hermione suddenly wait harry they can help 
 
 harry and ron looked at her 
 
 listen she said urgently harry we need to establish whether sirius really has left headquarters 
 
 told you i saw 
 
 harry begging you please said hermione desperately please just check that sirius at home before we go charging off to london if we find out not there then i swear i try to stop you come ddo whatever it takes to try and save him 
 
 sirius is being tortured now shouted harry we got time to waste 
 
 but if this is a trick of harry got to check got to 
 
 how harry demanded we going to check 
 
 have to use fire and see if we can contact him said hermione who looked positively terrified at the thought draw umbridge away again but need lookouts and where we can use ginny and luna 
 
 though clearly struggling to understand what was going on ginny said immediately yeah do it and luna said when you say sirius are you talking about stubby boardman 
 
 nobody answered her 
 
 ok harry said aggressively to hermione ok if you can think of a way of doing this quickly with you otherwise going to the department of mysteries right now 
 
 the department of mysteries said luna looking mildly surprised but how are you going to get there 
 
 again harry ignored her 
 
 right said hermione twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks right well one of us has to go and find umbridge andand send her off in the wrong direction keep her away from her office they could tell heri knowthat peeves is up to something awful as usual 
 
 do it said ron at once tell her peeves is smashing up the transfiguration department or something miles away from her office come to think of it i could probably persuade peeves to do it if i met him on the way 
 
 it was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the transfiguration department 
 
 ok she said her brow furrowed as she continued to pace now we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry or some bound to go and tip her off 
 
 luna and i can stand at either end of the corridor said ginny promptly and warn people not to go down there because let off a load of garrotting gas hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which ginny had come up with this lie ginny shrugged and said fred and george were planning to do it before they left 
 
 ok said hermione well then harry you and i will be under the invisibility cloak and sneak into the office and you can talk to sirius 
 
 not there hermione 
 
 i mean you can can check whether sirius is at home or not while i keep watch i think you should be in there alone already proved the windows a weak spot sending those nifflers through it 
 
 even through his anger and impatience harry recognised offer to accompany him into office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty 
 
 i ok thanks he muttered 
 
 right well even if we do all of that i think going to be able to bank on more than five minutes said hermione looking relieved that harry seemed to have accepted the plan not with filch and the wretched inquisitorial squad floating around 
 
 five be enough said harry go 
 
 now said hermione looking shocked 
 
 of course now said harry angrily what did you think going to wait until after dinner or something hermione sirius is being tortured right now 
 
 ioh all right she said desperately you go and get the invisibility cloak and meet you at the end of corridor ok 
 
 harry answer but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside two floors up he met seamus and dean who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a celebration in the common room harry barely heard them he scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it the invisibility cloak and knife secure in his bag before they noticed he had left them 
 
 harry want to chip in a couple of galleons harold dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky 
 
 but harry was already tearing away back along the corridor and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join ron hermione ginny and luna who were huddled together at the end of corridor 
 
 got it he panted ready to go then 
 
 all right whispered hermione as a gang of loud passed them so ronyou go and head umbridge off ginny luna if you can start moving people out of the corridor harry and i will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear 
 
 ron strode away his hair visible right to the end of the passage meanwhile equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction trailed by blonde one 
 
 get over here muttered hermione tugging at wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column areare you sure ok harry still very pale 
 
 fine he said shortly tugging the invisibility cloak from out of his bag in truth his scar was aching but not so badly that he thought voldemort had yet dealt sirius a fatal blow it had hurt much worse than this when voldemort had been punishing avery 
 
 here he said he threw the invisibility cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the latin mumblings of the bust in front of them 
 
 you come down here ginny was calling to the crowd no sorry going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase let off garrotting gas just along here 
 
 they could hear people complaining one surly voice said i see no gas 
 
 because colourless said ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice but if you want to walk through it carry on then have your body as proof for the next idiot who believe us 
 
 slowly the crowd thinned the news about the garrotting gas seemed to have spread people were not coming this way any more when at last the surrounding area was quite clear hermione said quietly i think as good as going to get harrycome on do it 
 
 they moved forwards covered by the cloak luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor as they passed ginny hermione whispered good one forget the signal 
 
 the signal muttered harry as they approached door 
 
 a loud chorus of weasley is our king if they see umbridge coming replied hermione as harry inserted the blade of knife in the crack between door and wall the lock clicked open and they entered the office 
 
 the garish kittens were basking in the sunshine that was warming their plates but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time hermione breathed a sigh of relief 
 
 i thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler 
 
 they pulled off the cloak hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight peering down into the grounds with her wand out harry dashed over to the fireplace seized the pot of floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate causing emerald flames to burst into life there he knelt down quickly thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 his head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor he kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long cold kitchen of grimmauld place 
 
 there was nobody there he had expected this yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room 
 
 sirius he shouted sirius are you there 
 
 his voice echoed around the room but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire 
 
 there he called wondering whether it was just a mouse 
 
 kreacher the crept into view he looked highly delighted about something though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands which were heavily bandaged 
 
 the potter head in the fire kreacher informed the empty kitchen stealing furtive oddly triumphant glances at harry what has he come for kreacher wonders 
 
 sirius kreacher harry demanded 
 
 the gave a wheezy chuckle 
 
 master has gone out harry potter 
 
 he gone he gone kreacher 
 
 kreacher merely cackled 
 
 warning you said harry fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon kreacher was almost in this position what about lupin any of them are any of them there 
 
 nobody here but kreacher said the elf gleefully and turning away from harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now yes he had a chance in a long time master has been keeping him away from her 
 
 where has sirius gone harry yelled after the elf kreacher has he gone to the department of mysteries 
 
 kreacher stopped in his tracks harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him 
 
 master does not tell poor kreacher where he is going said the elf quietly 
 
 but you know shouted harry you you know where he is 
 
 there was a silence then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet 
 
 master will not come back from the department of mysteries he said gleefully kreacher and his mistress are alone again 
 
 and he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall 
 
 you 
 
 but before he could utter a single curse or insult harry felt a great pain at the top of his head he inhaled a lot of ash and choking found himself being dragged backwards through the flames until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide pallid face of professor umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as though she were going to slit his throat 
 
 you think she whispered bending neck back even further so that he was looking up at the ceiling that after two nifflers i was going to let one more foul scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge i had stealth sensoring spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in you foolish boy take his wand she barked at someone he could not see and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand hers too 
 
 harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her 
 
 i want to know why you are in my office said umbridge shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered 
 
 i wastrying to get my firebolt harry croaked 
 
 liar she shook his head again your firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons as you very well know potter you had your head in my fire with whom have you been communicating 
 
 no one said harry trying to pull away from her he felt several hairs part company with his scalp 
 
 liar shouted umbridge she threw him from her and he slammed into the desk now he could see hermione pinioned against the wall by millicent bulstrode malfoy was leaning on the windowsill smirking as he threw wand into the air and caught it again 
 
 there was a commotion outside and several large slytherins entered each gripping ron ginny luna andto bewildermentneville who was trapped in a stranglehold by crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation all four of them had been gagged 
 
 got em all said warrington shoving ron roughly forwards into the room that one he poked a thick finger at neville tried to stop me taking her he pointed at ginny who was trying to kick the shins of the large slytherin girl holding her so i brought him along too 
 
 good good said umbridge watching struggles well it looks as though hogwarts will shortly be a zone it 
 
 malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically umbridge gave her wide complacent smile and settled herself into a armchair blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed 
 
 so potter she said you stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon she nodded at ronmalfoy laughed even tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the transfiguration department when i knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes mr filch having just informed me so 
 
 clearly it was very important for you to talk to somebody was it albus dumbledore or the hagrid i doubt it was minerva mcgonagall i hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone 
 
 malfoy and a few of the other members of the inquisitorial squad laughed some more at that harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking 
 
 none of your business who i talk to he snarled 
 
 slack face seemed to tighten 
 
 very well she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice very well mr potter i offered you the chance to tell me freely you refused i have no alternative but to force you draco fetch professor snape 
 
 malfoy slowed wand inside his robes and left the room smirking but harry hardly noticed he had just realised something he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it he had thought that all the members of the order all those who could help him save sirius were gonebut he had been wrong there was still a member of the order of the phoenix at hogwartssnape 
 
 there was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the slytherins efforts to keep ron and the others under control lip was bleeding on to carpet as he struggled against ginny was still trying to stamp on the feel of the girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while lugging at arms and hermione was attempting in vain to throw millicent bulstrode off her luna however stood limply by the side of her captor gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings 
 
 harry looked back at umbridge who was watching him closely he kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and draco malfoy entered the room closely followed by snape 
 
 you wanted to see me headmistress said snape looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference 
 
 ah professor snape said umbridge smiling widely and standing up again yes i would like another bottle of veritaserum as quick as you can please 
 
 you took my last bottle to interrogate potter he said surveying her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair surely you did not use it all i told you that three drops would be sufficient 
 
 umbridge flushed 
 
 you can make some more you she said her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious 
 
 certainly said snape his lip curling it takes a full to mature so i should have it ready for you in around a month 
 
 a month squawked umbndge swelling toadishly a i need it this evening snape i have just found potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown 
 
 really said snape showing his first faint sign of interest as he looked round at harry well it surprise me potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules 
 
 his cold dark eyes were boring into who met his gaze unflinchingly concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream willing snape to read it in his mind to understand 
 
 i wish to interrogate him repeated umbridge angrily and snape looked away from harry back into her furiously quivering lace i wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth 
 
 i have already told you said snape smoothly that i have no further stocks of veritaserum unless you wish to poison potterand i assure you i would have the greatest sympathy with you if you didi cannot help you the only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much lime for 
 
 snape looked back at harry who stared at him frantic to communicate without words 
 
 got sirius in the department of mysteries he thought desperately got sirius 
 
 you are on probation shrieked professor umbridge and snape looked back at her his eyebrows slightly raised you arc being deliberately unhelpful i expected better lucius malfoy always speaks most highly of you now get out of my office 
 
 snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave harry knew his last chance of letting the order know what was going on was walking out of the door 
 
 got padfoot he shouted got padfoot at the place where hidden 
 
 snape had stopped with his hand on door handle 
 
 padfoot cried professor umbridge looking eagerly from harry to snape what is padfoot where what is hidden what does he mean snape 
 
 snape looked round at harry his face was inscrutable harry could not tell whether he had understood or not but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of umbridge 
 
 i have no idea said snape coldly potter when i want nonsense shouted at me i shall give you a babbling beverage and crabbe loosen your hold a little if longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and i am afraid i shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job 
 
 he closed the door behind him with a snap leaving harry in a state of worse turmoil than before snape had been his very last hope he looked at umbridge who seemed to be feeling the same way her chest was heaving with rage and frustration 
 
 very well she said and she pulled out her wand very well i am left with no alternative this is more than a matter of school discipline this is an issue of ministry security yes yes 
 
 she seemed to be talking herself into something she was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot staring at harry beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily as he watched her harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand 
 
 you are forcing me potter i do not want to said umbridge still moving restlessly on the spot but sometimes circumstances justify the use i am sure the minister will understand that i had no choice 
 
 malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face 
 
 the cruciatus curse ought to loosen your tongue said umbridge quietly 
 
 no shrieked hermione professor illegal 
 
 but umbridge took no notice there was a nasty eager excited look on her face that harry had never seen before she raised her wand 
 
 the minister want you to break the law professor umbridge cried hermione 
 
 what cornelius know hurt him said umbridge who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of body in turn apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most he never knew i ordered dementors to go after potter last summer but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him all the same 
 
 it was you gasped harry you sent the dementors after me 
 
 somebody had to act breathed umbridge as her wand came to rest pointing directly at forehead they were all bleating about silencing you somehowdiscrediting you but i was the one who actually did something about it only you wriggled out of that one you potter not today though not now and taking a deep breath she cried cruc 
 
 no shouted hermione in a cracked voice from behind millicent bulstrode noharry have to tell her 
 
 no way yelled harry staring at the little of hermione he could see 
 
 have to harry force it out of you anyway the point 
 
 and hermione began to cry weakly into the back of millicent robes millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted 
 
 well well well said umbridge looking triumphant little miss is going to give us some answers come on then girl come on 
 
 ermynee no shouted ron through his gag 
 
 ginny was staring at hermione as though she had never seen her before neville still choking for breath was gazing at her too but harry had just noticed something though hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands there was no trace of a tear 
 
 sorry everyone said hermione buti stand it 
 
 right right girl said umbridge seizing hermione by the shoulders thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her now then with whom was potter communicating just now 
 
 well gulped hermione into her hands well he was trying to speak to professor dumbledore 
 
 ron froze his eyes wide ginny stopped trying to stamp on her slytherin toes and even luna looked mildly surprised fortunately the attention of umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon hermione to notice these suspicious signs 
 
 dumbledore said umbridge eagerly you know where dumbledore is then 
 
 well no sobbed hermione tried the leaky cauldron in diagon alley and the three broomsticks and even the head 
 
 idiot girl dumbledore be sitting in a pub when the whole looking for him shouted umbridge disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face 
 
 butbut we needed to tell him something important wailed hermione holding her hands more tightly over her face not harry knew out of anguish but to disguise the continued absence of tears 
 
 yes said umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement what was it you wanted to tell him 
 
 we we wanted to tell him rready choked hermione 
 
 ready demanded umbridge and now she grabbed shoulders again and shook her slightly ready girl 
 
 the the weapon said hermione 
 
 weapon weapon said umbridge and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement you have been developing some method of resistance a weapon you could use against the ministry on professor orders of course 
 
 yyyes gasped hermione but he had to leave before it was finished and nnnow finished it for him and we find him ttto tell him 
 
 what kind of weapon is it said umbridge harshly her stubby hands still tight on shoulders 
 
 we rr really understand it said hermione sniffing loudly we jjjust did what ppprofessor dumbledore told us ttto do 
 
 umbridge straightened up looking exultant 
 
 lead me to the weapon she said 
 
 not showing them said hermione shrilly looking around at the slytherins through her fingers 
 
 it is not for you to set conditions said professor umbridge harshly 
 
 fine said hermione now sobbing into her hands again fine let them see it i hope they use it on you in fact i wish invite loads and loads of people to come and see ththat would serve you rightoh love it if the wh whole school knew where it was and how to uuse it and then if you annoy any of them be able to ssort you out 
 
 these words had a powerful impact on umbridge she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her inquisitorial squad her bulging eyes resting for a moment on malfoy who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face 
 
 umbridge contemplated hermione for another long moment then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice 
 
 all right dear make it just you and me and take potter too shall we get up now 
 
 professor said malfoy eagerly professor umbridge i think some of the squad should come with you to look after 
 
 i am a fully qualified ministry official malfoy do you really think i cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone asked umbridge sharply in any case it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see you will remain here until i return and make sure none of these she gestured around at ron ginny neville and luna escape 
 
 all right said malfoy looking sulky and disappointed 
 
 and you two can go ahead of me and show me the way said umbridge pointing at harry and hermione with her wand lead on 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter out of the firecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 not going i need the hospital wing i want 
 
 he was gibbering as he tried to pull away from professor tofty who was looking at harry with much concern after helping him out into the entrance hall with the students all around them staring 
 
 fine sir harry stammered wiping the sweat from his face really i just fell asleep had a nightmare 
 
 pressure of examinations said the old wizard sympathetically patting harry shakily on the shoulder it happens young man it happens now a cooling drink of water and perhaps you will be ready to return to the great hall the examination is nearly over but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely 
 
 yes said harry wildly i mean no donedone as much as i can i think 
 
 very well very well said the old wizard gently i shall go and collect your examination paper and i suggest that you go and have a nice lie down 
 
 do that said harry nodding vigorously thanks very much 
 
 the second that the old heels disappeared over the threshold into the great hall harry ran up the marble staircase hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches up more flights of stairs and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing causing madam pomfreywho had been spooning some bright blue liquid into open mouthto shriek in alarm 
 
 potter what do you think doing 
 
 i need to see professor mcgonagall gasped harry the breath tearing his lungs now urgent 
 
 not here potter said madam pomfrey sadly she was transferred to st this morning four stunning spells straight to the chest at her age a wonder they kill her 
 
 gone said harry shocked 
 
 the bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him he remained quite still looking at madam pomfrey terror was rising inside him 
 
 there was nobody left to tell dumbledore had gone hagrid had gone but he had always expected professor mcgonagall to be there irascible and inflexible perhaps but always dependably solidly present 
 
 i wonder shocked potter said madam pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face as if one of them could have stunned minerva mcgonagall by daylight cowardice what it was despicable cowardice if i worried what would happen to you students without me resign in protest 
 
 yes said harry blankly 
 
 he wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood buffeted by the crowd panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do 
 
 ron and hermione said a voice in his head 
 
 he was running again pushing students out of the way oblivious to their angry protests he sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him 
 
 harry said hermione at once looking very frightened what happened are you all right are you ill 
 
 where have you been demanded ron 
 
 come with me harry said quickly come on got to tell you something 
 
 he led them along the corridor peering through doorways and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived closing the door behind ron and hermione the moment they were inside and leaned against it facing them 
 
 voldemorts got sirius 
 
 what 
 
 how 
 
 saw it just now when i fell asleep in the exam 
 
 butbut where how said hermione whose face was white 
 
 i dunno how said harry but i know exactly where a room in the department of mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and at the end of row trying to use sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there torturing him says end by killing him 
 
 harry found his voice was shaking as were his knees he moved over to a desk and sat down on it trying to master himself 
 
 we going to get there he asked them 
 
 there was a silence then ron said there 
 
 get to the department of mysteries so we can rescue sirius harry said loudly 
 
 butharry said ron weakly 
 
 what what said harry 
 
 he could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable 
 
 harry said hermione in a rather frightened voice er how how did voldemort get into the ministry of magic without anybody realising he was there 
 
 how do i know bellowed harry the question is how going to get in there 
 
 but harry think about this said hermione taking a step towards him five in the afternoon the ministry of magic must be full of workers how would voldemort and sirius have got in without being seen harry probably the two most wanted wizards in the world you think they could get into a building full of aurors undetected 
 
 i dunno voldemort used an invisibility cloak or something harry shouted anyway the department of mysteries has always been completely empty whenever been 
 
 never been there harry said hermione quietly dreamed about the place all 
 
 not normal dreams harry shouted in her face standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn he wanted to shake her how explain dad then what was all that about how come i knew what had happened to him 
 
 got a point said ron quietly looking at hermione 
 
 but this is just just so unlikely said hermione desperately harry how on earth could voldemort have got hold of sirius when been in grimmauld place all the time 
 
 sirius cracked and just wanted some fresh air said ron sounding worried been desperate to get out of that house for ages 
 
 but why hermione persisted why on earth would voldemort want to use sirius to get the weapon or whatever the thing is 
 
 i dunno there could be loads of reasons harry yelled at her maybe sirius is just someone voldemort care about seeing hurt 
 
 you know what just thought of something said ron in a hushed voice brother was a death eater he maybe he told sirius the secret of how to get the weapon 
 
 yeahand why been so keen to keep sirius locked up all the time said harry 
 
 look sorry cried hermione but neither of you is making sense and got no proof for any of this no proof voldemort and sirius are even there 
 
 hermione seen them said ron rounding on her 
 
 ok she said looking frightened yet determined just got to say this 
 
 what 
 
 you this a criticism harry but you do sort of i you think got a bit of thing she said 
 
 he glared at her 
 
 and that supposed to mean a thing 
 
 well you she looked more apprehensive than ever i mean last year for instance in the lake during the tournament you have i mean you need to save that little delacour girl you got a bit carried away 
 
 a wave of hot prickly anger swept through body now could she remind him of that blunder now 
 
 i mean it was really great of you and everything said hermione quickly looking positively petrified at the look on face everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do 
 
 funny said harry through gritted teeth because i definitely remember ron saying wasted time acting the hero is that what you think this is you reckon i want to act the hero again 
 
 no no no said hermione looking aghast not what i mean at all 
 
 well spit out what got to say because wasting time here harry shouted 
 
 trying to say voldemort knows you harry he took ginny down into the chamber of secrets to lure you there the kind of thing he does he knows thethe sort of person go to aid what if just trying to get you into the department of myst 
 
 hermione it matter if done it to get me there or taken mcgonagall to st there anyone from the order left at hogwarts who we can tell and if we go sirius is dead 
 
 but harrywhat if your dream waswas just that a dream 
 
 harry let out a roar of frustration hermione actually stepped back from him looking alarmed 
 
 you get it harry shouted at her not having nightmares not just dreaming what think all the occlumency was for why think dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things because real hermionesirius is trapped seen him got him and no one else knows and that means the only ones who can save him and if you want to do it fine but going understand and if i remember rightly you have a problem with my thing when it was you i was saving from the dementors orhe rounded on ronwhen it was your sister i was saving from the basilisk 
 
 i never said i had a problem said ron heatedly 
 
 but harry just said it said hermione fiercely dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind if done occlumency properly never have seen this 
 
 if you think just going to act like i seen 
 
 sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind 
 
 well i expect say something different if he knew what just 
 
 the classroom door opened harry ron and hermione whipped around ginny walked in looking curious closely followed by luna who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally 
 
 hi said ginny uncertainly we recognised voice what are you yelling about 
 
 never you mind said harry roughly 
 
 ginny raised her eyebrows 
 
 no need to take that tone with me she said coolly i was only wondering whether i could help 
 
 well you said harry shortly 
 
 being rather rude you know said luna serenely 
 
 harry swore and turned away the very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with luna lovegood 
 
 wait said hermione suddenly wait harry they can help 
 
 harry and ron looked at her 
 
 listen she said urgently harry we need to establish whether sirius really has left headquarters 
 
 told you i saw 
 
 harry begging you please said hermione desperately please just check that sirius at home before we go charging off to london if we find out not there then i swear i try to stop you come ddo whatever it takes to try and save him 
 
 sirius is being tortured now shouted harry we got time to waste 
 
 but if this is a trick of harry got to check got to 
 
 how harry demanded we going to check 
 
 have to use fire and see if we can contact him said hermione who looked positively terrified at the thought draw umbridge away again but need lookouts and where we can use ginny and luna 
 
 though clearly struggling to understand what was going on ginny said immediately yeah do it and luna said when you say sirius are you talking about stubby boardman 
 
 nobody answered her 
 
 ok harry said aggressively to hermione ok if you can think of a way of doing this quickly with you otherwise going to the department of mysteries right now 
 
 the department of mysteries said luna looking mildly surprised but how are you going to get there 
 
 again harry ignored her 
 
 right said hermione twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks right well one of us has to go and find umbridge andand send her off in the wrong direction keep her away from her office they could tell heri knowthat peeves is up to something awful as usual 
 
 do it said ron at once tell her peeves is smashing up the transfiguration department or something miles away from her office come to think of it i could probably persuade peeves to do it if i met him on the way 
 
 it was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the transfiguration department 
 
 ok she said her brow furrowed as she continued to pace now we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry or some bound to go and tip her off 
 
 luna and i can stand at either end of the corridor said ginny promptly and warn people not to go down there because let off a load of garrotting gas hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which ginny had come up with this lie ginny shrugged and said fred and george were planning to do it before they left 
 
 ok said hermione well then harry you and i will be under the invisibility cloak and sneak into the office and you can talk to sirius 
 
 not there hermione 
 
 i mean you can can check whether sirius is at home or not while i keep watch i think you should be in there alone already proved the windows a weak spot sending those nifflers through it 
 
 even through his anger and impatience harry recognised offer to accompany him into office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty 
 
 i ok thanks he muttered 
 
 right well even if we do all of that i think going to be able to bank on more than five minutes said hermione looking relieved that harry seemed to have accepted the plan not with filch and the wretched inquisitorial squad floating around 
 
 five be enough said harry go 
 
 now said hermione looking shocked 
 
 of course now said harry angrily what did you think going to wait until after dinner or something hermione sirius is being tortured right now 
 
 ioh all right she said desperately you go and get the invisibility cloak and meet you at the end of corridor ok 
 
 harry answer but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside two floors up he met seamus and dean who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a celebration in the common room harry barely heard them he scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it the invisibility cloak and knife secure in his bag before they noticed he had left them 
 
 harry want to chip in a couple of galleons harold dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky 
 
 but harry was already tearing away back along the corridor and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join ron hermione ginny and luna who were huddled together at the end of corridor 
 
 got it he panted ready to go then 
 
 all right whispered hermione as a gang of loud passed them so ronyou go and head umbridge off ginny luna if you can start moving people out of the corridor harry and i will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear 
 
 ron strode away his hair visible right to the end of the passage meanwhile equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction trailed by blonde one 
 
 get over here muttered hermione tugging at wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column areare you sure ok harry still very pale 
 
 fine he said shortly tugging the invisibility cloak from out of his bag in truth his scar was aching but not so badly that he thought voldemort had yet dealt sirius a fatal blow it had hurt much worse than this when voldemort had been punishing avery 
 
 here he said he threw the invisibility cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the latin mumblings of the bust in front of them 
 
 you come down here ginny was calling to the crowd no sorry going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase let off garrotting gas just along here 
 
 they could hear people complaining one surly voice said i see no gas 
 
 because colourless said ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice but if you want to walk through it carry on then have your body as proof for the next idiot who believe us 
 
 slowly the crowd thinned the news about the garrotting gas seemed to have spread people were not coming this way any more when at last the surrounding area was quite clear hermione said quietly i think as good as going to get harrycome on do it 
 
 they moved forwards covered by the cloak luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor as they passed ginny hermione whispered good one forget the signal 
 
 the signal muttered harry as they approached door 
 
 a loud chorus of weasley is our king if they see umbridge coming replied hermione as harry inserted the blade of knife in the crack between door and wall the lock clicked open and they entered the office 
 
 the garish kittens were basking in the sunshine that was warming their plates but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time hermione breathed a sigh of relief 
 
 i thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler 
 
 they pulled off the cloak hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight peering down into the grounds with her wand out harry dashed over to the fireplace seized the pot of floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate causing emerald flames to burst into life there he knelt down quickly thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 his head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor he kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long cold kitchen of grimmauld place 
 
 there was nobody there he had expected this yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room 
 
 sirius he shouted sirius are you there 
 
 his voice echoed around the room but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire 
 
 there he called wondering whether it was just a mouse 
 
 kreacher the crept into view he looked highly delighted about something though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands which were heavily bandaged 
 
 the potter head in the fire kreacher informed the empty kitchen stealing furtive oddly triumphant glances at harry what has he come for kreacher wonders 
 
 sirius kreacher harry demanded 
 
 the gave a wheezy chuckle 
 
 master has gone out harry potter 
 
 he gone he gone kreacher 
 
 kreacher merely cackled 
 
 warning you said harry fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon kreacher was almost in this position what about lupin any of them are any of them there 
 
 nobody here but kreacher said the elf gleefully and turning away from harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now yes he had a chance in a long time master has been keeping him away from her 
 
 where has sirius gone harry yelled after the elf kreacher has he gone to the department of mysteries 
 
 kreacher stopped in his tracks harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him 
 
 master does not tell poor kreacher where he is going said the elf quietly 
 
 but you know shouted harry you you know where he is 
 
 there was a silence then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet 
 
 master will not come back from the department of mysteries he said gleefully kreacher and his mistress are alone again 
 
 and he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall 
 
 you 
 
 but before he could utter a single curse or insult harry felt a great pain at the top of his head he inhaled a lot of ash and choking found himself being dragged backwards through the flames until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide pallid face of professor umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as though she were going to slit his throat 
 
 you think she whispered bending neck back even further so that he was looking up at the ceiling that after two nifflers i was going to let one more foul scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge i had stealth sensoring spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in you foolish boy take his wand she barked at someone he could not see and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand hers too 
 
 harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her 
 
 i want to know why you are in my office said umbridge shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered 
 
 i wastrying to get my firebolt harry croaked 
 
 liar she shook his head again your firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons as you very well know potter you had your head in my fire with whom have you been communicating 
 
 no one said harry trying to pull away from her he felt several hairs part company with his scalp 
 
 liar shouted umbridge she threw him from her and he slammed into the desk now he could see hermione pinioned against the wall by millicent bulstrode malfoy was leaning on the windowsill smirking as he threw wand into the air and caught it again 
 
 there was a commotion outside and several large slytherins entered each gripping ron ginny luna andto bewildermentneville who was trapped in a stranglehold by crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation all four of them had been gagged 
 
 got em all said warrington shoving ron roughly forwards into the room that one he poked a thick finger at neville tried to stop me taking her he pointed at ginny who was trying to kick the shins of the large slytherin girl holding her so i brought him along too 
 
 good good said umbridge watching struggles well it looks as though hogwarts will shortly be a zone it 
 
 malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically umbridge gave her wide complacent smile and settled herself into a armchair blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed 
 
 so potter she said you stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon she nodded at ronmalfoy laughed even tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the transfiguration department when i knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes mr filch having just informed me so 
 
 clearly it was very important for you to talk to somebody was it albus dumbledore or the hagrid i doubt it was minerva mcgonagall i hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone 
 
 malfoy and a few of the other members of the inquisitorial squad laughed some more at that harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking 
 
 none of your business who i talk to he snarled 
 
 slack face seemed to tighten 
 
 very well she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice very well mr potter i offered you the chance to tell me freely you refused i have no alternative but to force you draco fetch professor snape 
 
 malfoy slowed wand inside his robes and left the room smirking but harry hardly noticed he had just realised something he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it he had thought that all the members of the order all those who could help him save sirius were gonebut he had been wrong there was still a member of the order of the phoenix at hogwartssnape 
 
 there was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the slytherins efforts to keep ron and the others under control lip was bleeding on to carpet as he struggled against ginny was still trying to stamp on the feel of the girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while lugging at arms and hermione was attempting in vain to throw millicent bulstrode off her luna however stood limply by the side of her captor gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings 
 
 harry looked back at umbridge who was watching him closely he kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and draco malfoy entered the room closely followed by snape 
 
 you wanted to see me headmistress said snape looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference 
 
 ah professor snape said umbridge smiling widely and standing up again yes i would like another bottle of veritaserum as quick as you can please 
 
 you took my last bottle to interrogate potter he said surveying her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair surely you did not use it all i told you that three drops would be sufficient 
 
 umbridge flushed 
 
 you can make some more you she said her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious 
 
 certainly said snape his lip curling it takes a full to mature so i should have it ready for you in around a month 
 
 a month squawked umbndge swelling toadishly a i need it this evening snape i have just found potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown 
 
 really said snape showing his first faint sign of interest as he looked round at harry well it surprise me potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules 
 
 his cold dark eyes were boring into who met his gaze unflinchingly concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream willing snape to read it in his mind to understand 
 
 i wish to interrogate him repeated umbridge angrily and snape looked away from harry back into her furiously quivering lace i wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth 
 
 i have already told you said snape smoothly that i have no further stocks of veritaserum unless you wish to poison potterand i assure you i would have the greatest sympathy with you if you didi cannot help you the only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much lime for 
 
 snape looked back at harry who stared at him frantic to communicate without words 
 
 got sirius in the department of mysteries he thought desperately got sirius 
 
 you are on probation shrieked professor umbridge and snape looked back at her his eyebrows slightly raised you arc being deliberately unhelpful i expected better lucius malfoy always speaks most highly of you now get out of my office 
 
 snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave harry knew his last chance of letting the order know what was going on was walking out of the door 
 
 got padfoot he shouted got padfoot at the place where hidden 
 
 snape had stopped with his hand on door handle 
 
 padfoot cried professor umbridge looking eagerly from harry to snape what is padfoot where what is hidden what does he mean snape 
 
 snape looked round at harry his face was inscrutable harry could not tell whether he had understood or not but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of umbridge 
 
 i have no idea said snape coldly potter when i want nonsense shouted at me i shall give you a babbling beverage and crabbe loosen your hold a little if longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and i am afraid i shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job 
 
 he closed the door behind him with a snap leaving harry in a state of worse turmoil than before snape had been his very last hope he looked at umbridge who seemed to be feeling the same way her chest was heaving with rage and frustration 
 
 very well she said and she pulled out her wand very well i am left with no alternative this is more than a matter of school discipline this is an issue of ministry security yes yes 
 
 she seemed to be talking herself into something she was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot staring at harry beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily as he watched her harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand 
 
 you are forcing me potter i do not want to said umbridge still moving restlessly on the spot but sometimes circumstances justify the use i am sure the minister will understand that i had no choice 
 
 malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face 
 
 the cruciatus curse ought to loosen your tongue said umbridge quietly 
 
 no shrieked hermione professor illegal 
 
 but umbridge took no notice there was a nasty eager excited look on her face that harry had never seen before she raised her wand 
 
 the minister want you to break the law professor umbridge cried hermione 
 
 what cornelius know hurt him said umbridge who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of body in turn apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most he never knew i ordered dementors to go after potter last summer but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him all the same 
 
 it was you gasped harry you sent the dementors after me 
 
 somebody had to act breathed umbridge as her wand came to rest pointing directly at forehead they were all bleating about silencing you somehowdiscrediting you but i was the one who actually did something about it only you wriggled out of that one you potter not today though not now and taking a deep breath she cried cruc 
 
 no shouted hermione in a cracked voice from behind millicent bulstrode noharry have to tell her 
 
 no way yelled harry staring at the little of hermione he could see 
 
 have to harry force it out of you anyway the point 
 
 and hermione began to cry weakly into the back of millicent robes millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted 
 
 well well well said umbridge looking triumphant little miss is going to give us some answers come on then girl come on 
 
 ermynee no shouted ron through his gag 
 
 ginny was staring at hermione as though she had never seen her before neville still choking for breath was gazing at her too but harry had just noticed something though hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands there was no trace of a tear 
 
 sorry everyone said hermione buti stand it 
 
 right right girl said umbridge seizing hermione by the shoulders thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her now then with whom was potter communicating just now 
 
 well gulped hermione into her hands well he was trying to speak to professor dumbledore 
 
 ron froze his eyes wide ginny stopped trying to stamp on her slytherin toes and even luna looked mildly surprised fortunately the attention of umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon hermione to notice these suspicious signs 
 
 dumbledore said umbridge eagerly you know where dumbledore is then 
 
 well no sobbed hermione tried the leaky cauldron in diagon alley and the three broomsticks and even the head 
 
 idiot girl dumbledore be sitting in a pub when the whole looking for him shouted umbridge disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face 
 
 butbut we needed to tell him something important wailed hermione holding her hands more tightly over her face not harry knew out of anguish but to disguise the continued absence of tears 
 
 yes said umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement what was it you wanted to tell him 
 
 we we wanted to tell him rready choked hermione 
 
 ready demanded umbridge and now she grabbed shoulders again and shook her slightly ready girl 
 
 the the weapon said hermione 
 
 weapon weapon said umbridge and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement you have been developing some method of resistance a weapon you could use against the ministry on professor orders of course 
 
 yyyes gasped hermione but he had to leave before it was finished and nnnow finished it for him and we find him ttto tell him 
 
 what kind of weapon is it said umbridge harshly her stubby hands still tight on shoulders 
 
 we rr really understand it said hermione sniffing loudly we jjjust did what ppprofessor dumbledore told us ttto do 
 
 umbridge straightened up looking exultant 
 
 lead me to the weapon she said 
 
 not showing them said hermione shrilly looking around at the slytherins through her fingers 
 
 it is not for you to set conditions said professor umbridge harshly 
 
 fine said hermione now sobbing into her hands again fine let them see it i hope they use it on you in fact i wish invite loads and loads of people to come and see ththat would serve you rightoh love it if the wh whole school knew where it was and how to uuse it and then if you annoy any of them be able to ssort you out 
 
 these words had a powerful impact on umbridge she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her inquisitorial squad her bulging eyes resting for a moment on malfoy who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face 
 
 umbridge contemplated hermione for another long moment then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice 
 
 all right dear make it just you and me and take potter too shall we get up now 
 
 professor said malfoy eagerly professor umbridge i think some of the squad should come with you to look after 
 
 i am a fully qualified ministry official malfoy do you really think i cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone asked umbridge sharply in any case it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see you will remain here until i return and make sure none of these she gestured around at ron ginny neville and luna escape 
 
 all right said malfoy looking sulky and disappointed 
 
 and you two can go ahead of me and show me the way said umbridge pointing at harry and hermione with her wand lead on 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the elder wandcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the world had ended so why had the battle not ceased the castle fallen silent in horror and every combatant laid down their arms harrys mind was in free fall spinning out of control unable to grasp the impossibility because fred weasley could not be dead the evidence of all his senses must be lyingcand then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness hitting the wall behind their heads 
 
 get down harry shouted as more curses flew through the night he and ron had both grabbed hermione and pulled her to the floor but percy lay across freds body shielding it from further harm and when harry shouted percy come on weve got to move he shook his head 
 
 percy harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating rons face as he seized his elder brothers shoulders and pulled but percy would not budge percy you cant do anything for him were going toc 
 
 hermione screamed and harry turning did not need to ask why a monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall one of aragogs descendants had joined the fight 
 
 ron and harry shouted together their spells collided and the monster was blown backward its legs jerking horribly and vanished into the darkness 
 
 it brought friends harry called to the others glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted more giant spiders were climbing the side of the building liberated from the forbidden forest into which the death eaters must have penetrated harry fired stunning spells down upon them knocking the lead monster into its fellows so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight then more curses came soaring over harrys head so close he felt the force of them blow his hair 
 
 lets move now 
 
 pushing hermione ahead of him with ron harry stooped to seize freds body under the armpit percy realizing what harry was trying to do stopped clinging to the body and helped together crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds they hauled fred out of the way 
 
 here said harry and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier he could not bear to look at fred a second longer than he had to and after making sure that the body was he took off after ron and hermione malfoy and goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor which was now full of dust and falling masonry glass long gone from windows he saw many people running backward and forward whether friends or foes he could not tell rounding the corner percy let out a roar rookwood and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man who was pursuing a couple of students harry in here hermione screamed 
 
 she had pulled ron behind a tapestry they seemed to be wrestling together and for one mad second harry thought that they were embracing again then he saw that hermione was trying to restrain ron to stop him running after percy 
 
 listen to me c listen ron 
 
 i wanna help c i wanna kill death eatersc 
 
 his face was contorted smeared with dust and smoke and he was shaking with rage and grief 
 
 ron were the only ones who can end it please c ron c we need the snake weve got to kill the snake said hermione 
 
 but harry knew how ron felt pursuing another horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge he too wanted to fight to punish them the people who had killed fred and he wanted to find the other weasleys and above all make sure make quite sure that ginny was not c but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind c we will fight hermione said well have to to reach the snake but lets not lose sight now of what were supposed to be were the only ones who can end it 
 
 she was crying too and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as still keeping a tight hold on ron she turned to harry 
 
 you need to find out where voldemort is because hell have the snake with him wont he do it harry c look inside him 
 
 why was it so easy because his scar had been burning for hours yearning to show him voldemorts thoughts he closed his eyes on her command and at once the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant as though he stood far far away from them 
 
 
 
 
 he was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one the sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant the single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp 
 
 he was rolling his wand between his fingers watching it his thoughts on the room in the castle the secret room only he had ever found the room like the chamber that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discoverhe was confident that the boy would not find the diademalthough dumbledores puppet had come much farther than he ever expectedtoo far 
 
 my lord said a voice desperate and cracked he turned there was lucius malfoy sitting in the darkest corner ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boys last escape one of his eyes remained closed and puffy my lordpleasemy son 
 
 if your son is dead lucius it is not my fault he did not come and join me like the rest of the slytherins perhaps he has decided to befriend harry potter 
 
 no c never whispered malfoy you must hope not 
 
 arent c arent you afraid my lord that potter might die at another hand but yours asked malfoy his voice shaking wouldnt it beforgive memore prudent to call off this battle enter the castle and seek him 
 
 do not pretend lucius you wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son and i do not need to seek potter before the night is out potter will have come to find me 
 
 voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers it troubled himand those things that troubled lord voldemort needed to be rearrangedgo and fetch snape 
 
 snape lord 
 
 snape now i need him there is a c service c i require from him go 
 
 frightened stumbling a little through the gloom lucius left the room vodlemort continued to stand there twirling the wand between his fingers staring at it 
 
 it is the only way nagini he whispered and he looked around and there was the great thick snake now suspended in midair twisting gracefully within the enchanted protected space he had made for her a starry transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank 
 
 with a gasp harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries the smashes and bangs of battle 
 
 hes in the shrieking shack the snakes with him its got some sort of magical protection around it hes just sent lucius malfoy to find snape 
 
 voldemorts sitting in the shrieking shack said hermione outraged hes not c hes not even fighting 
 
 he doesnt think he needs to fight said harry he thinks im going to go to him 
 
 but why 
 
 he knows im after horcruxes c hes keeping nagini close beside him c obviously im going to have to go to him to get near the thingc 
 
 right said ron squaring his shoulders so you cant go thats what he wants what hes expecting you stay here and look after hermione and ill go and get itc harry cut across ron 
 
 you two stay here ill go under the cloak and ill be back as soon as ic 
 
 no said hermione it makes much more sense if i take the cloak andc 
 
 dont even think about it ron snarled at her before hermione could get farther than ron im just as capable c the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open 
 
 potter 
 
 two masked death eaters stood there but even before their wands were fully raised hermione shouted glisseo 
 
 the stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she harry and ron hurtled down it unable to control their speed but so fast that the death eaters stunning spells flew far over their heads they shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor hitting the opposite wall 
 
 duro cried hermione pointing her wand at the tapestry and there were two loud sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the death eaters pursuing them crumpled against it 
 
 get back shouted ron and he harry and hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past shepherded by a sprinting professor mcgonagall she appeared not to notice them her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek as she turned the corner they heard her scream 
 
 charge 
 
 harry you get the cloak on said hermione never mind usc 
 
 but he threw it over all three of them large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air the falling stone the shimmer of spells they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers the portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement while death eaters both masked and unmasked dueled students and teachers dean had won himself a wand for he was with dolohov parvati with travers harry ron and hermione raised their wands at once ready to strike but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses even as they stood braced looking for the opportunity to act there came a great wheeeeee and looking up harry saw peeves zooming over them dropping snargaluff pods down onto the death eaters whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms 
 
 argh 
 
 a fistful of tubers had hit the cloak over rons head the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as ron tried to shake them loose 
 
 someones invisible there shouted a masked death eater pointing 
 
 dean made the most of the death eaters momentary distraction knocking him out with a stunning spell dolohov attempted to retaliate and parvati shot a body bind curse at him lets go harry yelled and he ron and hermione gathered the cloak tightly around themselves and pelted heads down through the midst of the fighters slipping a little in pools of snargaluff juice toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall 
 
 im draco malfoy im draco im on your side draco was on the upper landing pleading with another masked death eater harry stunned the death eater as they passed malfoy looked around beaming for his savior and ron punched him from under the cloak malfoy fell backward on top of the death eater his mouth bleeding utterly bemused 
 
 and thats the second time weve saved your life tonight you bastard ron yelled 
 
 there were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall death eaters everywhere harry looked yaxley close to the front doors in combat with flitwick a masked death eater dueling kingsley right beside them students ran in every direction some carrying or dragging injured friends harry directed a stunning spell toward the masked death eater it missed but nearly hit neville who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of venomous tentacula which looped itself happily around the nearest death eater and began reeling him in 
 
 harry ron and hermione sped won the marble staircase glass shattered on the left and the slytherin hourglass that had recorded house points spilled its emeralds everywhere so that people slipped and staggered as they ran two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that harry took for an animal sped across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen 
 
 no shrieked hermione and with a deafening blast from her wand fenrir greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of lavender brown he hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet then with a bright white flash and a crack a crystal ball fell on top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move 
 
 i have more shrieked professor trelawney from over the banisters more for any who want them herec and with a move like a tennis serve she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag waved her wand through the air and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window at the same moment the heavy wooden front doors burst open and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall 
 
 screams of terror rent the air the fighters scattered death eaters and hogwartians alike and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters which shuddered and reared more terrifying than ever 
 
 how do we get out yelled ron over all the screaming but before either harry or hermione could answer they were bowled aside hagrid had come thundering down the stairs brandishing his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 dont hurt em dont hurt em he yelled 
 
 hagrid no 
 
 harry forgot everything else he sprinted out from under the cloak running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall 
 
 hagrid come back 
 
 but he was not even halfway to hagrid when he saw it happen hagrid vanished amongst the spiders and with a great scurrying a foul swarming movement they retreated under the onslaught of spells hagrid buried in their midst 
 
 hagrid harry heard someone calling his own name whether friend or foe he did not care he was springing down the front steps into the dark grounds and the spiders were swarming away with their prey and he could see nothing of hagrid at all 
 
 hagrid 
 
 he thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm but as he made to chase after them his way was impeded by a monumental foot which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder he looked up a giant stood before him twenty feet high its head hidden in shadow nothing but its treelike hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors with one brutal fluid movement it smashed a massive fist through an upper window and glass rained down upon harry forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway 
 
 oh myc shrieked hermione as she and ron caught up with harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above 
 
 dont ron yelled grabbing hermiones hand as she raised her wand stun him and hell crush half the castlec 
 
 hagger 
 
 grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle only now did harry realize that grawp was indeed an undersized giant the gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a roar the stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin and grawps lopsided mouth fell open showing yellow half teeth and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions 
 
 run harry roared the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled and he seized hermiones hand and tore down the steps into the grounds ron bringing up the rear harry had not lost hope of finding and saving hagrid he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again 
 
 the air around them had frozen harrys breath caught and solidified in his chest shapes moved out in the darkness swirling figures of concentrated blackness moving in a great wave towards the castles their faces hooded and their breath rattling 
 
 ron and hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted deadened because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night and fred was gone and hagrid was surely dying or already dead 
 
 come on harry said hermiones voice from a very long way away 
 
 patronuses harry come on 
 
 he raised his wand but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him how many more lay dead that he did not yet know about he felt as though his soul had already half left his body 
 
 harry come on screamed hermione 
 
 a hundred dementors were advancing gliding toward them sucking their way closer to harrys despair which was like a promise of a feast 
 
 he saw rons silver terrier burst into the air flicker feebly and expire he saw hermiones otter twist in midair and fade and his own wand trembled in his hand and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion the promise of nothing of no feeling 
 
 and then a silver hare a boar and fox soared past harry ron and hermiones heads the dementors fell back before the creatures approach three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them their wands outstretched continuing to cast patronuses luna ernie and seamus 
 
 thats right said luna encouragingly as if they were back in the room of requirement and this was simply spell practice for the thats right harrycome on think of something happy 
 
 something happy he said his voice cracked 
 
 were all still here she whispered still fighting come on now 
 
 there was a silver spark then a wavering light and then with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of harrys wand it cantered forward and now the dementors scattered in earnest and immediately the night was mild again but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears 
 
 cant thank you enough said ron shakily turning to luna ernie and seamus you just savedc 
 
 with a roar and an tremor another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest brandishing a club taller than any of them 
 
 run harry shouted again but the others needed no telling they all scattered and not a second too soon for the next moment the creatures vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing harry looked round ron and hermione were following him but the other three had vanished back into the battle lets get out of range yelled ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness 
 
 the whomping willow said harry go somehow he walled it all up in his mind crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now thoughts of fred and hagrid and his terror for all the people he loved scattered in and outside the castle must all wait because they had to run had to reach the snake and voldemort because that was as hermione said the only way to end it c 
 
 he sprinted he could outdistance death itself ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea and the creaking of the forbidden forest though the night was windless through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life and it was he who saw the great tree first the willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike slashing branches panting and gasping harry slowed down skirting the willows swiping branches peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it ron and hermione caught up hermione so out of breath that she could not speak 
 
 how c howre we going to get in panted ron i can c see the place c if we just had c crookshanks again c 
 
 crookshanks wheezed hermione bent double clutching her chest are you a wizard or what 
 
 oh c right c yeah c 
 
 ron looked around then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said winguardium leviosa the twig flew up from the ground spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind then zoomed directly at the trunk through the willows ominously swaying branches it jabbed at a place near the roots and at once the writhing tree became still perfect panted hermione wait 
 
 for one teetering second while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air harry hesitated voldemort wanted him to do this wanted him to comewas he leading ron and hermione into a trap but the reality seemed to close upon him cruel and plain the only way forward was to kill the snake and the snake was where voldemort was and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel 
 
 harry were coming just get in there said ron pushing him forward 
 
 harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the trees roots 
 
 it was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it the tunnel was they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously now there was nothing for it but to crawl harry went first his wand illuminated expecting at any moment to meet barriers but none came they moved in silence harrys gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist at last the tunnel began to slope upward and harry saw a sliver of light ahead hermione tugged at his ankle 
 
 the cloak she whispered put the cloak on 
 
 he groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand with difficulty he dragged it over himself murmured nox extinguishing his wandlight and continued on his hands and knees as silently as possible all his senses straining expecting every second to be discovered to hear a cold clear voice see a flash of green light 
 
 
 
 
 and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate hardly daring to breathe harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall 
 
 the room beyond was dimly lit but he could see nagini swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater safe in her enchanted starry sphere which floated unsupported in midair he could see the edge of a table and a white hand toying with a wand 
 
 then snape spoke and harrys heart lurched snape was inches away from where he crouched hidden 
 
 my lord their resistance is crumbling c 
 
 c and it is doing so without your help said voldemort in his high clear voice skilled wizard though you are severus i do not think you will make much difference now we are almost therealmost 
 
 let me find the boy let me bring you potter i know i can find him my lord please 
 
 snape strode past the gap and harry drew back a little keeping his eyes fixed upon nagini wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her but he could not think of anything one failed attempt and he would give away his position 
 
 voldemort stood up harry could see him now see the red eyes the flattened serpentine face the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness 
 
 i have a problem severus said voldemort softly 
 
 my lord said snape 
 
 voldemort raised the elder wand holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductors baton 
 
 why doesnt it work for me severus 
 
 in the silence harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiledcor was it voldemorts sibilant sigh lingering on the air 
 
 my c my lord said snape blankly i do not understand you c you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand 
 
 no said voldemort i have performed my usual magic i am extraordinary but this wandno it has not revealed the wonders it has promised i feel no difference between this wand and the one i procured from ollivander all those years ago 
 
 voldemorts tone was musing calm but harrys scar had begun to throb and pulse pain was building in his forehead and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside voldemort 
 
 no difference said voldemort again 
 
 snape did not speak harry could not see his face he wondered whether snape sensed danger was trying to find the right words to reassure his master 
 
 voldemort started to move around the room harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled speaking in that same measured voice while the pain and fury mounted in harry 
 
 i have thought long and hard severusdo you know why i have called you back from battle 
 
 and for a moment harry saw snapes profile his eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage 
 
 no my lord but i beg you will let me return let me find potter 
 
 you sound like lucius neither of you understands potter as i do he does not need finding potter will come to me i knew his weakness you see his one great flaw he will hate watching the others struck down around him knowing that it is for him that it happens he will want to stop it at any cost he will come 
 
 but my lord he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourselfc 
 
 my instructions to the death eaters have been perfectly clear capture potter kill his friends c the more the better c but do not kill him 
 
 but it is of you that i wished to speak severus not harry potter you have been very valuable to me very valuable 
 
 my lord knows i seek only to serve him but c let me go and find the boy my lord let me bring him to you i know i can c 
 
 i have told you no said voldemort and harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake and he felt voldemorts impatience in his burning scar my concern at the moment severus is what will happen when i finally meet the boy 
 
 my lord there can be no question surely c 
 
 c but there is a question severus there is 
 
 voldemort halted and harry could see him plainly again as he slid the elder wand through his white fingers staring at snape 
 
 why did both the wands i have used fail when directed at harry potter 
 
 i c i cannot answer that my lord 
 
 cant you 
 
 the stab of rage felt like a spike driven through harrys head he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain he closed his eyes and suddenly he was voldemort looking into snapes pale face 
 
 my wand of yew did everything of which i asked it severus except to kill harry potter twice it failed ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores told me to take anothers wand i did so but luciuss wand shattered upon meeting potters 
 
 i c i have no explanation my lord 
 
 snape was not looking at voldemort now his dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere 
 
 i sought a third wand severus the elder wand the wand of destiny the deathstick i took it from its previous master i took it from the grave of albus dumbledore 
 
 and now snape looked at voldemort and snapes face was like a death mask it was marble white and so still that when he spoke it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes 
 
 my lord c let me go to the boy c 
 
 all this long night when i am on the brink of victory i have sat here said voldemort his voice barely louder than a whisper wondering wondering why the elder wand refuses to be what it ought to be refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful ownerand i think i have the answer 
 
 snape did not speak 
 
 perhaps you already know it you are a clever man after all severus you have been a good and faithful servant and i regret what must happen 
 
 my lordc 
 
 the elder wand cannot serve me properly severus because i am not its true master the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner you killed albus dumbledore while you live severus the elder wand cannot truly be mine 
 
 my lord snape protested raising his wand 
 
 it cannot be any other way said voldemort i must master the wand severus master the wand and i master potter at last 
 
 and voldemort swiped the air with the elder wand it did nothing to snape who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved but then voldemorts intention became clear the snakes cage was rolling through the air and before snape could do anything more than yell it had encased him head and shoulders and voldemort spoke in parseltongue 
 
 kill 
 
 there was a terrible scream harry saw snapes face losing the little color it had left it whitened as his black eyes widened as the snakes fangs pierced his neck as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor 
 
 i regret it said voldemort coldly 
 
 he turned away there was no sadness in him no remorse it was time to leave this shack and take charge with a wand that would now do his full bidding he pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake which drifted upward off snape who fell sideways onto the floor blood gushing from the wounds in his neck voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere 
 
 
 
 
 back in the tunnel and his own mind harry opened his eyes he had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor 
 
 harry breathed hermione behind him but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view it lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently as quietly as he could he pulled himself up into the room 
 
 he did not know why he was doing it why he was approaching the dying man he did not know what he felt as he saw snapes white face and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated whose widening black eyes found harry as he cried to speak harry bent over him and snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close 
 
 a terrible rasping gurgling noise issued from snapes throat 
 
 takeittakeit 
 
 something more than blood was leaking from snape silvery blue neither gas nor liquid it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes and harry knew what it was but did not know what to do c a flask conjured from thin air was thrust into his shaking hand by hermione harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand when the flask was full to the brim and snape looked as though there was no blood left in him his grip on harrys robes slackened 
 
 he whispered 
 
 the green eyes found the black but after a second something in the depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish leaving them fixed blank and empty the hand holding harry thudded to the floor and snape moved no more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter the elder wandcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the world had ended so why had the battle not ceased the castle fallen silent in horror and every combatant laid down their arms harrys mind was in free fall spinning out of control unable to grasp the impossibility because fred weasley could not be dead the evidence of all his senses must be lyingcand then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness hitting the wall behind their heads 
 
 get down harry shouted as more curses flew through the night he and ron had both grabbed hermione and pulled her to the floor but percy lay across freds body shielding it from further harm and when harry shouted percy come on weve got to move he shook his head 
 
 percy harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating rons face as he seized his elder brothers shoulders and pulled but percy would not budge percy you cant do anything for him were going toc 
 
 hermione screamed and harry turning did not need to ask why a monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall one of aragogs descendants had joined the fight 
 
 ron and harry shouted together their spells collided and the monster was blown backward its legs jerking horribly and vanished into the darkness 
 
 it brought friends harry called to the others glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted more giant spiders were climbing the side of the building liberated from the forbidden forest into which the death eaters must have penetrated harry fired stunning spells down upon them knocking the lead monster into its fellows so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight then more curses came soaring over harrys head so close he felt the force of them blow his hair 
 
 lets move now 
 
 pushing hermione ahead of him with ron harry stooped to seize freds body under the armpit percy realizing what harry was trying to do stopped clinging to the body and helped together crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds they hauled fred out of the way 
 
 here said harry and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier he could not bear to look at fred a second longer than he had to and after making sure that the body was he took off after ron and hermione malfoy and goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor which was now full of dust and falling masonry glass long gone from windows he saw many people running backward and forward whether friends or foes he could not tell rounding the corner percy let out a roar rookwood and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man who was pursuing a couple of students harry in here hermione screamed 
 
 she had pulled ron behind a tapestry they seemed to be wrestling together and for one mad second harry thought that they were embracing again then he saw that hermione was trying to restrain ron to stop him running after percy 
 
 listen to me c listen ron 
 
 i wanna help c i wanna kill death eatersc 
 
 his face was contorted smeared with dust and smoke and he was shaking with rage and grief 
 
 ron were the only ones who can end it please c ron c we need the snake weve got to kill the snake said hermione 
 
 but harry knew how ron felt pursuing another horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge he too wanted to fight to punish them the people who had killed fred and he wanted to find the other weasleys and above all make sure make quite sure that ginny was not c but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind c we will fight hermione said well have to to reach the snake but lets not lose sight now of what were supposed to be were the only ones who can end it 
 
 she was crying too and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as still keeping a tight hold on ron she turned to harry 
 
 you need to find out where voldemort is because hell have the snake with him wont he do it harry c look inside him 
 
 why was it so easy because his scar had been burning for hours yearning to show him voldemorts thoughts he closed his eyes on her command and at once the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant as though he stood far far away from them 
 
 
 
 
 he was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one the sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant the single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp 
 
 he was rolling his wand between his fingers watching it his thoughts on the room in the castle the secret room only he had ever found the room like the chamber that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discoverhe was confident that the boy would not find the diademalthough dumbledores puppet had come much farther than he ever expectedtoo far 
 
 my lord said a voice desperate and cracked he turned there was lucius malfoy sitting in the darkest corner ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boys last escape one of his eyes remained closed and puffy my lordpleasemy son 
 
 if your son is dead lucius it is not my fault he did not come and join me like the rest of the slytherins perhaps he has decided to befriend harry potter 
 
 no c never whispered malfoy you must hope not 
 
 arent c arent you afraid my lord that potter might die at another hand but yours asked malfoy his voice shaking wouldnt it beforgive memore prudent to call off this battle enter the castle and seek him 
 
 do not pretend lucius you wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son and i do not need to seek potter before the night is out potter will have come to find me 
 
 voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers it troubled himand those things that troubled lord voldemort needed to be rearrangedgo and fetch snape 
 
 snape lord 
 
 snape now i need him there is a c service c i require from him go 
 
 frightened stumbling a little through the gloom lucius left the room vodlemort continued to stand there twirling the wand between his fingers staring at it 
 
 it is the only way nagini he whispered and he looked around and there was the great thick snake now suspended in midair twisting gracefully within the enchanted protected space he had made for her a starry transparent sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank 
 
 with a gasp harry pulled back and opened his yees at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries the smashes and bangs of battle 
 
 hes in the shrieking shack the snakes with him its got some sort of magical protection around it hes just sent lucius malfoy to find snape 
 
 voldemorts sitting in the shrieking shack said hermione outraged hes not c hes not even fighting 
 
 he doesnt think he needs to fight said harry he thinks im going to go to him 
 
 but why 
 
 he knows im after horcruxes c hes keeping nagini close beside him c obviously im going to have to go to him to get near the thingc 
 
 right said ron squaring his shoulders so you cant go thats what he wants what hes expecting you stay here and look after hermione and ill go and get itc harry cut across ron 
 
 you two stay here ill go under the cloak and ill be back as soon as ic 
 
 no said hermione it makes much more sense if i take the cloak andc 
 
 dont even think about it ron snarled at her before hermione could get farther than ron im just as capable c the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open 
 
 potter 
 
 two masked death eaters stood there but even before their wands were fully raised hermione shouted glisseo 
 
 the stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she harry and ron hurtled down it unable to control their speed but so fast that the death eaters stunning spells flew far over their heads they shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor hitting the opposite wall 
 
 duro cried hermione pointing her wand at the tapestry and there were two loud sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the death eaters pursuing them crumpled against it 
 
 get back shouted ron and he harry and hermione hurled themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past shepherded by a sprinting professor mcgonagall she appeared not to notice them her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek as she turned the corner they heard her scream 
 
 charge 
 
 harry you get the cloak on said hermione never mind usc 
 
 but he threw it over all three of them large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air the falling stone the shimmer of spells they ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers the portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement while death eaters both masked and unmasked dueled students and teachers dean had won himself a wand for he was with dolohov parvati with travers harry ron and hermione raised their wands at once ready to strike but the duelers were weaving and darting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of their own side if they cast curses even as they stood braced looking for the opportunity to act there came a great wheeeeee and looking up harry saw peeves zooming over them dropping snargaluff pods down onto the death eaters whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms 
 
 argh 
 
 a fistful of tubers had hit the cloak over rons head the damp green roots were suspended improbably in midair as ron tried to shake them loose 
 
 someones invisible there shouted a masked death eater pointing 
 
 dean made the most of the death eaters momentary distraction knocking him out with a stunning spell dolohov attempted to retaliate and parvati shot a body bind curse at him lets go harry yelled and he ron and hermione gathered the cloak tightly around themselves and pelted heads down through the midst of the fighters slipping a little in pools of snargaluff juice toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall 
 
 im draco malfoy im draco im on your side draco was on the upper landing pleading with another masked death eater harry stunned the death eater as they passed malfoy looked around beaming for his savior and ron punched him from under the cloak malfoy fell backward on top of the death eater his mouth bleeding utterly bemused 
 
 and thats the second time weve saved your life tonight you bastard ron yelled 
 
 there were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall death eaters everywhere harry looked yaxley close to the front doors in combat with flitwick a masked death eater dueling kingsley right beside them students ran in every direction some carrying or dragging injured friends harry directed a stunning spell toward the masked death eater it missed but nearly hit neville who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of venomous tentacula which looped itself happily around the nearest death eater and began reeling him in 
 
 harry ron and hermione sped won the marble staircase glass shattered on the left and the slytherin hourglass that had recorded house points spilled its emeralds everywhere so that people slipped and staggered as they ran two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that harry took for an animal sped across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen 
 
 no shrieked hermione and with a deafening blast from her wand fenrir greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of lavender brown he hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet then with a bright white flash and a crack a crystal ball fell on top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move 
 
 i have more shrieked professor trelawney from over the banisters more for any who want them herec and with a move like a tennis serve she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag waved her wand through the air and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window at the same moment the heavy wooden front doors burst open and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the front hall 
 
 screams of terror rent the air the fighters scattered death eaters and hogwartians alike and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters which shuddered and reared more terrifying than ever 
 
 how do we get out yelled ron over all the screaming but before either harry or hermione could answer they were bowled aside hagrid had come thundering down the stairs brandishing his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 dont hurt em dont hurt em he yelled 
 
 hagrid no 
 
 harry forgot everything else he sprinted out from under the cloak running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall 
 
 hagrid come back 
 
 but he was not even halfway to hagrid when he saw it happen hagrid vanished amongst the spiders and with a great scurrying a foul swarming movement they retreated under the onslaught of spells hagrid buried in their midst 
 
 hagrid harry heard someone calling his own name whether friend or foe he did not care he was springing down the front steps into the dark grounds and the spiders were swarming away with their prey and he could see nothing of hagrid at all 
 
 hagrid 
 
 he thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm but as he made to chase after them his way was impeded by a monumental foot which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder he looked up a giant stood before him twenty feet high its head hidden in shadow nothing but its treelike hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors with one brutal fluid movement it smashed a massive fist through an upper window and glass rained down upon harry forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway 
 
 oh myc shrieked hermione as she and ron caught up with harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above 
 
 dont ron yelled grabbing hermiones hand as she raised her wand stun him and hell crush half the castlec 
 
 hagger 
 
 grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle only now did harry realize that grawp was indeed an undersized giant the gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a roar the stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin and grawps lopsided mouth fell open showing yellow half teeth and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions 
 
 run harry roared the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled and he seized hermiones hand and tore down the steps into the grounds ron bringing up the rear harry had not lost hope of finding and saving hagrid he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again 
 
 the air around them had frozen harrys breath caught and solidified in his chest shapes moved out in the darkness swirling figures of concentrated blackness moving in a great wave towards the castles their faces hooded and their breath rattling 
 
 ron and hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted deadened because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night and fred was gone and hagrid was surely dying or already dead 
 
 come on harry said hermiones voice from a very long way away 
 
 patronuses harry come on 
 
 he raised his wand but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him how many more lay dead that he did not yet know about he felt as though his soul had already half left his body 
 
 harry come on screamed hermione 
 
 a hundred dementors were advancing gliding toward them sucking their way closer to harrys despair which was like a promise of a feast 
 
 he saw rons silver terrier burst into the air flicker feebly and expire he saw hermiones otter twist in midair and fade and his own wand trembled in his hand and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion the promise of nothing of no feeling 
 
 and then a silver hare a boar and fox soared past harry ron and hermiones heads the dementors fell back before the creatures approach three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them their wands outstretched continuing to cast patronuses luna ernie and seamus 
 
 thats right said luna encouragingly as if they were back in the room of requirement and this was simply spell practice for the thats right harrycome on think of something happy 
 
 something happy he said his voice cracked 
 
 were all still here she whispered still fighting come on now 
 
 there was a silver spark then a wavering light and then with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of harrys wand it cantered forward and now the dementors scattered in earnest and immediately the night was mild again but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears 
 
 cant thank you enough said ron shakily turning to luna ernie and seamus you just savedc 
 
 with a roar and an tremor another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest brandishing a club taller than any of them 
 
 run harry shouted again but the others needed no telling they all scattered and not a second too soon for the next moment the creatures vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing harry looked round ron and hermione were following him but the other three had vanished back into the battle lets get out of range yelled ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness 
 
 the whomping willow said harry go somehow he walled it all up in his mind crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now thoughts of fred and hagrid and his terror for all the people he loved scattered in and outside the castle must all wait because they had to run had to reach the snake and voldemort because that was as hermione said the only way to end it c 
 
 he sprinted he could outdistance death itself ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea and the creaking of the forbidden forest though the night was windless through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life and it was he who saw the great tree first the willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike slashing branches panting and gasping harry slowed down skirting the willows swiping branches peering through the darkness toward its tick trunk trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it ron and hermione caught up hermione so out of breath that she could not speak 
 
 how c howre we going to get in panted ron i can c see the place c if we just had c crookshanks again c 
 
 crookshanks wheezed hermione bent double clutching her chest are you a wizard or what 
 
 oh c right c yeah c 
 
 ron looked around then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said winguardium leviosa the twig flew up from the ground spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind then zoomed directly at the trunk through the willows ominously swaying branches it jabbed at a place near the roots and at once the writhing tree became still perfect panted hermione wait 
 
 for one teetering second while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air harry hesitated voldemort wanted him to do this wanted him to comewas he leading ron and hermione into a trap but the reality seemed to close upon him cruel and plain the only way forward was to kill the snake and the snake was where voldemort was and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel 
 
 harry were coming just get in there said ron pushing him forward 
 
 harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the trees roots 
 
 it was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it the tunnel was they had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously now there was nothing for it but to crawl harry went first his wand illuminated expecting at any moment to meet barriers but none came they moved in silence harrys gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist at last the tunnel began to slope upward and harry saw a sliver of light ahead hermione tugged at his ankle 
 
 the cloak she whispered put the cloak on 
 
 he groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand with difficulty he dragged it over himself murmured nox extinguishing his wandlight and continued on his hands and knees as silently as possible all his senses straining expecting every second to be discovered to hear a cold clear voice see a flash of green light 
 
 
 
 
 and then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate hardly daring to breathe harry edged right up tot he opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall 
 
 the room beyond was dimly lit but he could see nagini swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater safe in her enchanted starry sphere which floated unsupported in midair he could see the edge of a table and a white hand toying with a wand 
 
 then snape spoke and harrys heart lurched snape was inches away from where he crouched hidden 
 
 my lord their resistance is crumbling c 
 
 c and it is doing so without your help said voldemort in his high clear voice skilled wizard though you are severus i do not think you will make much difference now we are almost therealmost 
 
 let me find the boy let me bring you potter i know i can find him my lord please 
 
 snape strode past the gap and harry drew back a little keeping his eyes fixed upon nagini wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her but he could not think of anything one failed attempt and he would give away his position 
 
 voldemort stood up harry could see him now see the red eyes the flattened serpentine face the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness 
 
 i have a problem severus said voldemort softly 
 
 my lord said snape 
 
 voldemort raised the elder wand holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductors baton 
 
 why doesnt it work for me severus 
 
 in the silence harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiledcor was it voldemorts sibilant sigh lingering on the air 
 
 my c my lord said snape blankly i do not understand you c you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand 
 
 no said voldemort i have performed my usual magic i am extraordinary but this wandno it has not revealed the wonders it has promised i feel no difference between this wand and the one i procured from ollivander all those years ago 
 
 voldemorts tone was musing calm but harrys scar had begun to throb and pulse pain was building in his forehead and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside voldemort 
 
 no difference said voldemort again 
 
 snape did not speak harry could not see his face he wondered whether snape sensed danger was trying to find the right words to reassure his master 
 
 voldemort started to move around the room harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled speaking in that same measured voice while the pain and fury mounted in harry 
 
 i have thought long and hard severusdo you know why i have called you back from battle 
 
 and for a moment harry saw snapes profile his eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage 
 
 no my lord but i beg you will let me return let me find potter 
 
 you sound like lucius neither of you understands potter as i do he does not need finding potter will come to me i knew his weakness you see his one great flaw he will hate watching the others struck down around him knowing that it is for him that it happens he will want to stop it at any cost he will come 
 
 but my lord he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourselfc 
 
 my instructions to the death eaters have been perfectly clear capture potter kill his friends c the more the better c but do not kill him 
 
 but it is of you that i wished to speak severus not harry potter you have been very valuable to me very valuable 
 
 my lord knows i seek only to serve him but c let me go and find the boy my lord let me bring him to you i know i can c 
 
 i have told you no said voldemort and harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake and he felt voldemorts impatience in his burning scar my concern at the moment severus is what will happen when i finally meet the boy 
 
 my lord there can be no question surely c 
 
 c but there is a question severus there is 
 
 voldemort halted and harry could see him plainly again as he slid the elder wand through his white fingers staring at snape 
 
 why did both the wands i have used fail when directed at harry potter 
 
 i c i cannot answer that my lord 
 
 cant you 
 
 the stab of rage felt like a spike driven through harrys head he forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain he closed his eyes and suddenly he was voldemort looking into snapes pale face 
 
 my wand of yew did everything of which i asked it severus except to kill harry potter twice it failed ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores told me to take anothers wand i did so but luciuss wand shattered upon meeting potters 
 
 i c i have no explanation my lord 
 
 snape was not looking at voldemort now his dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere 
 
 i sought a third wand severus the elder wand the wand of destiny the deathstick i took it from its previous master i took it from the grave of albus dumbledore 
 
 and now snape looked at voldemort and snapes face was like a death mask it was marble white and so still that when he spoke it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes 
 
 my lord c let me go to the boy c 
 
 all this long night when i am on the brink of victory i have sat here said voldemort his voice barely louder than a whisper wondering wondering why the elder wand refuses to be what it ought to be refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful ownerand i think i have the answer 
 
 snape did not speak 
 
 perhaps you already know it you are a clever man after all severus you have been a good and faithful servant and i regret what must happen 
 
 my lordc 
 
 the elder wand cannot serve me properly severus because i am not its true master the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner you killed albus dumbledore while you live severus the elder wand cannot truly be mine 
 
 my lord snape protested raising his wand 
 
 it cannot be any other way said voldemort i must master the wand severus master the wand and i master potter at last 
 
 and voldemort swiped the air with the elder wand it did nothing to snape who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved but then voldemorts intention became clear the snakes cage was rolling through the air and before snape could do anything more than yell it had encased him head and shoulders and voldemort spoke in parseltongue 
 
 kill 
 
 there was a terrible scream harry saw snapes face losing the little color it had left it whitened as his black eyes widened as the snakes fangs pierced his neck as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor 
 
 i regret it said voldemort coldly 
 
 he turned away there was no sadness in him no remorse it was time to leave this shack and take charge with a wand that would now do his full bidding he pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake which drifted upward off snape who fell sideways onto the floor blood gushing from the wounds in his neck voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere 
 
 
 
 
 back in the tunnel and his own mind harry opened his eyes he had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor 
 
 harry breathed hermione behind him but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view it lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently as quietly as he could he pulled himself up into the room 
 
 he did not know why he was doing it why he was approaching the dying man he did not know what he felt as he saw snapes white face and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated whose widening black eyes found harry as he cried to speak harry bent over him and snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close 
 
 a terrible rasping gurgling noise issued from snapes throat 
 
 takeittakeit 
 
 something more than blood was leaking from snape silvery blue neither gas nor liquid it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes and harry knew what it was but did not know what to do c a flask conjured from thin air was thrust into his shaking hand by hermione harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand when the flask was full to the brim and snape looked as though there was no blood left in him his grip on harrys robes slackened 
 
 he whispered 
 
 the green eyes found the black but after a second something in the depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish leaving them fixed blank and empty the hand holding harry thudded to the floor and snape moved no more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the beetle who went on his travels 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once an emperor who had a horse shod with gold he had a golden shoe on each foot and why was this he was a beautiful creature with slender legs bright intelligent eyes and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil he had carried his master through fire and smoke in the with the bullets whistling round him he had kicked and bitten and taken part in the fight when the enemy advanced and with his master on his back he had dashed over the fallen foe and saved the golden crown and the life which was of more value than the brightest gold this is the reason of the horse wearing golden shoes 
 
 a beetle came creeping forth from the stable where the farrier 
 had been shoeing the horse great ones first of course said he 
 
 and then the little ones but size is not always a proof of greatness he stretched out his thin leg as he spoke 
 
 and pray what do you want asked the farrier 
 golden shoes replied the beetle 
 why you must be out of your senses cried the farrier 
 golden shoes for you indeed 
 yes certainly golden shoes replied the beetle am i not just 
 as good as that great creature yonder who is waited upon and brushed and has food and drink placed before him and i belong to the royal stables 
 
 but why does the horse have golden shoes asked the farrier of 
 course you understand the reason 
 
 understand well i understand that it is a personal slight to 
 me cried the beetle it is done to annoy me so i intend to go 
 out into the world and seek my fortune 
 
 go along with you said the farrier 
 
 a rude fellow cried the beetle as he walked out of 
 the stable and then he flew for a short distance till he found 
 himself in a beautiful all fragrant with roses and 
 lavender the with red and black shells on their backs 
 and delicate wings were flying about and one of them said is it 
 not sweet and lovely here oh how beautiful everything is 
 
 i am accustomed to better things said the beetle do you 
 call this beautiful why there is not even a then he went 
 on and under the shadow of a large haystack he found a caterpillar 
 crawling along how beautiful this world is said the caterpillar 
 
 the sun is so warm i quite enjoy it and soon i shall go to sleep 
 and die as they call it but i shall wake up with beautiful wings to 
 fly with like a butterfly 
 
 how conceited you are exclaimed the beetle fly about as a 
 butterfly indeed what of that i have come out of the 
 stable and no one there not even the horse who in 
 fact wears my golden shoes has any idea of flying 
 excepting myself to have wings and fly why i can do that 
 already and so saying he spread his wings and flew away i 
 want to be disgusted he said to himself and yet i help 
 it soon after he fell down upon an extensive lawn and for a time 
 pretended to sleep but at last fell asleep in earnest suddenly a 
 heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds the beetle woke 
 up with the noise and would have been glad to creep into the earth for 
 shelter but he could not he was tumbled over and over with the rain 
 sometimes swimming on his stomach and sometimes on his back and as for flying that was out of the question he began to doubt whether he should escape with his life so he remained quietly lying where he was after a while the weather cleared up a little and the beetle was able to rub the water from his eyes and look about him 
 he saw something gleaming and he managed to make his way up to it it was linen which had been laid to bleach on the grass he crept into a fold of the damp linen which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as the warm stable but there was nothing better so he 
 remained lying there for a whole day and night and the rain kept on 
 all the time towards morning he crept out of his 
 feeling in a very bad temper with the climate two frogs were 
 sitting on the linen and their bright eyes actually glistened with 
 pleasure 
 
 wonderful weather this cried one of them and so refreshing 
 this linen holds the water together so beautifully that my hind 
 legs quiver as if i were going to swim 
 
 i should like to know said another if the swallow who flies 
 so far in her many journeys to foreign lands ever met with a better 
 climate than this what delicious moisture it is as pleasant as lying 
 in a wet ditch i am sure any one who does not enjoy this has no 
 love for his fatherland 
 
 have you ever been in the stable asked the beetle 
 
 there the moisture is warm and refreshing the climate for me 
 but i could not take it with me on my travels is there not even a 
 dunghill here in this garden where a person of rank like myself 
 could take up his abode and feel at home but the frogs either did 
 not or would not understand him 
 
 i never ask a question twice said the beetle after he had 
 asked this one three times and received no answer then he went on 
 a little farther and stumbled against a piece of broken 
 which certainly ought not to have been lying there but as it was 
 there it formed a good shelter against wind and weather to several 
 families of earwigs who dwelt in it their requirements were not many 
 they were very sociable and full of affection for their children 
 so much so that each mother considered her own child the most 
 beautiful and clever of them all 
 
 our dear son has engaged himself said one mother dear 
 innocent boy his greatest ambition is that he may one day creep 
 into a ear that is a very artless and loveable wish 
 and being engaged will keep him steady what happiness for a mother 
 
 our son said another had scarcely crept out of the egg 
 when he was off on his travels he is all life and spirits i expect 
 he will wear out his horns with running how charming this is for a 
 mother is it not mr beetle for she knew the stranger by his 
 horny coat 
 
 you are both quite right said he so they begged him to walk 
 in that is to come as far as he could under the broken piece of 
 earthenware 
 
 now you shall also see my little earwigs said a third and a 
 fourth mother they are lovely little things and highly amusing 
 they are never except when they are uncomfortable in 
 their inside which unfortunately often happens at their age 
 
 thus each mother spoke of her baby and their babies talked 
 after their own fashion and made use of the little nippers they 
 have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle 
 
 they are always busy about something the little rogues said 
 the mother beaming with maternal pride but the beetle felt it a 
 bore and he therefore inquired the way to the nearest 
 that is quite out in the great world on the other side of the 
 ditch answered an earwig i hope none of my children will ever go 
 so far it would be the death of me 
 
 but i shall try to get so far said the beetle and he walked 
 off without taking any formal leave which is considered a polite 
 thing to do 
 
 when he arrived at the ditch he met several friends all them 
 beetles we live here they said and we are very comfortable 
 may we ask you to step down into this rich mud you must be fatigued after your journey 
 
 certainly said the beetle i shall be most happy i have 
 been exposed to the rain and have had to lie upon linen and 
 cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me i have also pains 
 in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of 
 broken crockery it is really quite refreshing to be with own 
 kindred again 
 
 perhaps you came from a observed the oldest of them 
 
 no indeed i came from a much grander place replied the 
 beetle i came from the stable where i was born with 
 golden shoes on my feet i am travelling on a secret embassy but 
 you must not ask me any questions for i cannot betray my secret 
 then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud where sat three 
 beetles who tittered because they did not know what to 
 say 
 
 none of them are engaged yet said their mother and the 
 beetle maidens tittered again this time quite in confusion 
 
 i have never seen greater beauties even in the royal stables 
 exclaimed the beetle who was now resting himself 
 
 spoil my girls said the mother and talk to 
 them pray unless you have serious intentions 
 
 but of course the intentions were serious and after a 
 while our friend was engaged the mother gave them her blessing and all the other beetles cried hurrah 
 
 immediately after the betrothal came the marriage for there was 
 no reason to delay the following day passed very pleasantly and 
 the next was tolerably comfortable but on the third it became 
 necessary for him to think of getting food for his wife and perhaps 
 for children 
 
 i have allowed myself to be taken in said our beetle to himself and now nothing to be done but to take them in in 
 return 
 
 no sooner said than done away he went and stayed away all day 
 and all night and his wife remained behind a forsaken widow 
 oh said the other beetles this fellow that we have received 
 into our family is nothing but a complete vagabond he has gone away and left his wife a burden upon our hands 
 
 well she can be unmarried again and remain here with my other 
 daughters said the mother fie on the villain that forsook her 
 in the mean time the beetle who had sailed across the ditch on 
 a cabbage leaf had been journeying on the other side in the 
 morning two persons came up to the ditch when they saw him they 
 took him up and turned him over and over looking very learned all the time especially one who was a boy allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and the black rock is not that written in the 
 koran he asked 
 
 then he translated the name into latin and said a 
 great deal upon the nature and history the second 
 person who was older and a scholar proposed to carry the beetle 
 home as they wanted just such good specimens as this our beetle 
 considered this speech a great insult so he flew suddenly out of 
 the hand his wings were dry now so they carried him to a 
 great distance till at last he reached a hothouse where a sash of 
 the glass roof was partly open so he quietly slipped in and buried 
 himself in the warm earth it is very comfortable here he said to 
 himself and soon after fell asleep then he dreamed that the 
 horse was dying and had left him his golden shoes and also promised that he should have two more all this was very delightful and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him what a splendid place the hothouse was at the back large were growing and the sunlight made the leaves look quite glossy and beneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green and of flowers red like flame yellow as amber or white as snow what a wonderful quantity of plants cried the beetle how good they will taste when they are decayed this is a capital there must certainly be some relations of mine living here i will just see if i can find any one with whom i can associate proud certainly but also proud of being so then he prowled about in the earth and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse and the golden shoes he had inherited suddenly a hand seized the beetle and squeezed him and turned him round and round 
 
 the little son and his playfellow had come into the 
 hothouse and seeing the beetle wanted to have some fun with him 
 first he was wrapped in a and put into a warm trousers 
 pocket he twisted and turned about with all his might but he got a 
 good squeeze from the hand as a hint for him to keep quiet 
 then the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the 
 garden here the beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe in 
 which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast and to this 
 mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted now he was a 
 sailor and had to sail away the lake was not very large but to 
 the beetle it seemed an ocean and he was so astonished at its size 
 that he fell over on his back and kicked out his legs then the 
 little ship sailed away sometimes the current of the water seized it 
 but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned 
 up his trousers and went in after it and brought it back to land 
 but at last just as it went merrily out again the two boys were 
 called and so angrily that they hastened to obey and ran away as 
 fast as they could from the pond so that the little ship was left 
 to its fate it was carried away farther and farther from the shore 
 till it reached the open sea this was a terrible prospect for the 
 beetle for he could not escape in consequence of being bound to the 
 mast then a fly came and paid him a visit what beautiful 
 weather said the fly i shall rest here and sun myself you must 
 have a pleasant time of it 
 
 you speak without knowing the facts replied the beetle 
 
 you see that i am a prisoner 
 
 ah but not a prisoner remarked the fly and away he flew 
 well now i know the world said the beetle to himself an 
 abominable world the only respectable person in it first they 
 refuse me my golden shoes then i have to lie on damp linen and to 
 stand in a draught and to crown all they fasten a wife upon me 
 then when i have made a step forward in the world and found out a 
 comfortable position just as i could wish it to be one of these 
 human boys comes and ties me up and leaves me to the mercy of the 
 wild waves while the favorite horse goes prancing about 
 proudly on his golden shoes this vexes me more than anything but 
 it is useless to look for sympathy in this world my career has been 
 very interesting but the use of that if nobody knows 
 anything about it the world does not deserve to be made acquainted 
 with my adventures for it ought to have given me golden shoes when 
 the horse was shod and i stretched out my feet to be 
 shod too if i had received golden shoes i should have been an 
 ornament to the stable now i am lost to the stable and to the 
 world it is all over with me 
 
 but all was not yet over a boat in which were a few young girls 
 came rowing up look yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along said one of the younger girls 
 
 and a poor little creature bound fast in it said another 
 
 the boat now came close to our ship and the young 
 girls fished it out of the water one of them drew a small pair of 
 scissors from her pocket and cut the worsted without hurting the 
 beetle and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the grass 
 
 there she said creep away or fly if thou canst it is a 
 splendid thing to have thy liberty away flew the beetle straight 
 through the open window of a large building there he sank down tired and exhausted exactly on the mane of the favorite horse who was standing in his stable and the beetle found himself at home again for some time he clung to the mane that he might recover himself well he said here i am seated on the favorite horse sitting upon him as if i were the emperor himself but what was it the farrier asked me ah i remember now a good 
 thought he asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse 
 
 the answer is quite clear to me now they were given to the horse 
 on my account and this reflection put the beetle into a good temper 
 
 the rays also came streaming into the stable and shone upon 
 him and made the place lively and bright travelling expands the 
 mind very much said the beetle the world is not so bad after 
 all if you know how to take things as they come

 cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me i have also pains 
 in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of 
 broken crockery it is really quite refreshing to be with own 
 kindred again 
 
 perhaps you came from a observed the oldest of them 
 
 no indeed i came from a much grander place replied the 
 beetle i came from the stable where i was born with 
 golden shoes on my feet i am travelling on a secret embassy but 
 you must not ask me any questions for i cannot betray my secret 
 then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud where sat three 
 beetles who tittered because they did not know what to 
 say 
 
 none of them are engaged yet said their mother and the 
 beetle maidens tittered again this time quite in confusion 
 
 i have never seen greater beauties even in the royal stables 
 exclaimed the beetle who was now resting himself 
 
 spoil my girls said the mother and talk to 
 them pray unless you have serious intentions 
 
 but of course the intentions were serious and after a 
 while our friend was engaged the mother gave them her blessing and all the other beetles cried hurrah 
 
 immediately after the betrothal came the marriage for there was 
 no reason to delay the following day passed very pleasantly and 
 the next was tolerably comfortable but on the third it became 
 necessary for him to think of getting food for his wife and perhaps 
 for children 
 
 i have allowed myself to be taken in said our beetle to himself and now nothing to be done but to take them in in 
 return 
 
 no sooner said than done away he went and stayed away all day 
 and all night and his wife remained behind a forsaken widow 
 oh said the other beetles this fellow that we have received 
 into our family is nothing but a complete vagabond he has gone away and left his wife a burden upon our hands 
 
 well she can be unmarried again and remain here with my other 
 daughters said the mother fie on the villain that forsook her 
 in the mean time the beetle who had sailed across the ditch on 
 a cabbage leaf had been journeying on the other side in the 
 morning two persons came up to the ditch when they saw him they 
 took him up and turned him over and over looking very learned all the time especially one who was a boy allah sees the black beetle in the black stone and the black rock is not that written in the 
 koran he asked 
 
 then he translated the name into latin and said a 
 great deal upon the nature and history the second 
 person who was older and a scholar proposed to carry the beetle 
 home as they wanted just such good specimens as this our beetle 
 considered this speech a great insult so he flew suddenly out of 
 the hand his wings were dry now so they carried him to a 
 great distance till at last he reached a hothouse where a sash of 
 the glass roof was partly open so he quietly slipped in and buried 
 himself in the warm earth it is very comfortable here he said to 
 himself and soon after fell asleep then he dreamed that the 
 horse was dying and had left him his golden shoes and also promised that he should have two more all this was very delightful and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him what a splendid place the hothouse was at the back large were growing and the sunlight made the leaves look quite glossy and beneath them what a profusion of luxuriant green and of flowers red like flame yellow as amber or white as snow what a wonderful quantity of plants cried the beetle how good they will taste when they are decayed this is a capital there must certainly be some relations of mine living here i will just see if i can find any one with whom i can associate proud certainly but also proud of being so then he prowled about in the earth and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse and the golden shoes he had inherited suddenly a hand seized the beetle and squeezed him and turned him round and round 
 
 the little son and his playfellow had come into the 
 hothouse and seeing the beetle wanted to have some fun with him 
 first he was wrapped in a and put into a warm trousers 
 pocket he twisted and turned about with all his might but he got a 
 good squeeze from the hand as a hint for him to keep quiet 
 then the boy went quickly towards a lake that lay at the end of the 
 garden here the beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe in 
 which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast and to this 
 mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted now he was a 
 sailor and had to sail away the lake was not very large but to 
 the beetle it seemed an ocean and he was so astonished at its size 
 that he fell over on his back and kicked out his legs then the 
 little ship sailed away sometimes the current of the water seized it 
 but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned 
 up his trousers and went in after it and brought it back to land 
 but at last just as it went merrily out again the two boys were 
 called and so angrily that they hastened to obey and ran away as 
 fast as they could from the pond so that the little ship was left 
 to its fate it was carried away farther and farther from the shore 
 till it reached the open sea this was a terrible prospect for the 
 beetle for he could not escape in consequence of being bound to the 
 mast then a fly came and paid him a visit what beautiful 
 weather said the fly i shall rest here and sun myself you must 
 have a pleasant time of it 
 
 you speak without knowing the facts replied the beetle 
 
 you see that i am a prisoner 
 
 ah but not a prisoner remarked the fly and away he flew 
 well now i know the world said the beetle to himself an 
 abominable world the only respectable person in it first they 
 refuse me my golden shoes then i have to lie on damp linen and to 
 stand in a draught and to crown all they fasten a wife upon me 
 then when i have made a step forward in the world and found out a 
 comfortable position just as i could wish it to be one of these 
 human boys comes and ties me up and leaves me to the mercy of the 
 wild waves while the favorite horse goes prancing about 
 proudly on his golden shoes this vexes me more than anything but 
 it is useless to look for sympathy in this world my career has been 
 very interesting but the use of that if nobody knows 
 anything about it the world does not deserve to be made acquainted 
 with my adventures for it ought to have given me golden shoes when 
 the horse was shod and i stretched out my feet to be 
 shod too if i had received golden shoes i should have been an 
 ornament to the stable now i am lost to the stable and to the 
 world it is all over with me 
 
 but all was not yet over a boat in which were a few young girls 
 came rowing up look yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along said one of the younger girls 
 
 and a poor little creature bound fast in it said another 
 
 the boat now came close to our ship and the young 
 girls fished it out of the water one of them drew a small pair of 
 scissors from her pocket and cut the worsted without hurting the 
 beetle and when she stepped on shore she placed him on the grass 
 
 there she said creep away or fly if thou canst it is a 
 splendid thing to have thy liberty away flew the beetle straight 
 through the open window of a large building there he sank down tired and exhausted exactly on the mane of the favorite horse who was standing in his stable and the beetle found himself at home again for some time he clung to the mane that he might recover himself well he said here i am seated on the favorite horse sitting upon him as if i were the emperor himself but what was it the farrier asked me ah i remember now a good 
 thought he asked me why the golden shoes were given to the horse 
 
 the answer is quite clear to me now they were given to the horse 
 on my account and this reflection put the beetle into a good temper 
 
 the rays also came streaming into the stable and shone upon 
 him and made the place lively and bright travelling expands the 
 mind very much said the beetle the world is not so bad after 
 all if you know how to take things as they come

 chapter xiii 
 
 in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance he was just what he used to be as before he was and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own the difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance at present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man and so people had been inclined to avoid him now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips and sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by his presence 
 previously he had talked a great deal grew excited when he talked and seldom listened now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets 
 the princess who had never liked pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old death now after staying a short time in orel where she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him felt to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him pierre did not in any way seek her approval he merely studied her with interest formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her character 
 the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them yet cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered hard and in her own way proud princess 
 yes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself thought she 
 his servants too terenty and vaska in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become much simpler terenty when he had helped him undress and wished him good night often lingered with his boots in his hands and clothes over his arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierre noticing that terenty wanted a chat generally kept him there 
 well tell me now how did you get food he would ask 
 and terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of the old count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking or sometimes listening to stories and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him 
 the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general and especially of the ladies 
 a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like our provincials he would say 
 there were several prisoners from the french army in orel and the doctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierre 
 this officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him 
 the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk with him tell him about his past his life at home and his love and pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially against napoleon 
 if all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fight such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the french do not even feel animosity toward them 
 pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing 
 during the last days of stay in orel his old masonic acquaintance count willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in came to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress who had a large estate in orel province and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town 
 hearing that bezukhov was in orel willarski though they had never been intimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and as he supposed of similar interests 
 but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much behind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself into apathy and egotism 
 you are letting yourself go my dear fellow he said 
 but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with pierre and came to see him every day to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before 
 willarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairs his affairs and his official duties he regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family military administrative political and masonic interests continually absorbed his attention and pierre without trying to change the views and without condemning him but with the quiet joyful and amused smile now habitual to him was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon 
 there was a new feature in relations with willarski with the princess with the doctor and with all the people he now met which gained for him the general good will this was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a convictions by words and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and seeing things each from his own point of view this legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in other people the difference and sometimes complete contradiction between opinions and their lives and between one man and another pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile 
 in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questions especially requests for money to which as an extremely wealthy man he was very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity to give or not to give he had asked himself i have it and he needs it but someone else needs it still more who needs it most and perhaps they are both impostors in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property when one person advised one thing and another something else 
 now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions there was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done 
 he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a colonel came to him and after talking a great deal about his exploits concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused the demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving orel to induce the italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need a further proof to pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near moscow 
 his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him his diminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according to the head calculation about two million rubles 
 to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his debts which he was under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild his moscow house and the country house on his moscow estate which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing 
 yes of course true said pierre with a cheerful smile i need all that at all by being ruined i have become much richer 
 but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of the state of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of this as of a settled matter about the same time he received letters from prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his debts and pierre decided that the proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his affairs and must rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he did not know but he knew for certain that it was necessary his income would be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be done 
 willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together 
 during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had experienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday everyone the stagecoach driver the overseers the peasants on the roads and in the villages had a new significance for him the presence and remarks of willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pleasure where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original peculiar and unique people he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him

 future progress 
 the excavation of the sewer of paris has been no slight task the last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination any more than they have been able to finish paris 
 the sewer in fact receives all the of the growth of paris 
 within the bosom of the earth it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae which expands below as the city expands above 
 every time that the city cuts a street the sewer stretches out an arm 
 the old monarchy had constructed only thousand three hundred metres of sewers that was where paris stood in this respect on the first of january beginning with this epoch of which we shall shortly speak the work was usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted napoleon figures are thousand eight hundred and four metres louis xviii five thousand seven hundred and nine charles x ten thousand eight hundred and thousand and twenty the republic of thousand three hundred and the present government seventy thousand five hundred in all at the present time two hundred and thousand six hundred and ten metres sixty leagues of sewers the enormous entrails of paris 
 an obscure ramification ever at work a construction which is immense and ignored 
 as the reader sees the subterranean labyrinth of paris is more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century it is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to bring this to the point of relative perfection in which it now is 
 it was with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical provostship and during the last ten years of the eighteenth century the revolutionary mayoralty had succeeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to

 future progress 
 the excavation of the sewer of paris has been no slight task the last ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination any more than they have been able to finish paris 
 the sewer in fact receives all the of the growth of paris 
 within the bosom of the earth it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae which expands below as the city expands above 
 every time that the city cuts a street the sewer stretches out an arm 
 the old monarchy had constructed only thousand three hundred metres of sewers that was where paris stood in this respect on the first of january beginning with this epoch of which we shall shortly speak the work was usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted napoleon figures are thousand eight hundred and four metres louis xviii five thousand seven hundred and nine charles x ten thousand eight hundred and thousand and twenty the republic of thousand three hundred and the present government seventy thousand five hundred in all at the present time two hundred and thousand six hundred and ten metres sixty leagues of sewers the enormous entrails of paris 
 an obscure ramification ever at work a construction which is immense and ignored 
 as the reader sees the subterranean labyrinth of paris is more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century it is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to bring this to the point of relative perfection in which it now is 
 it was with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical provostship and during the last ten years of the eighteenth century the revolutionary mayoralty had succeeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 
 all sorts of obstacles hindered this operation some peculiar to the soil others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population of paris 
 paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to the pick the hoe the bore and to human manipulation 
 there is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called paris as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium subterranean resistances abound there are liquid clays springs hard rocks and those soft and deep quagmires which special science calls moutardes the pick advances laboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of clay and schistose beds in plates incrusted with the contemporaries of the oceans

 book but the soul

 the sewer and its surprises 
 it was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself 
 still another resemblance between paris and the sea 
 as in the ocean the diver may disappear there 
 the transition was an one 
 in the very heart of the city jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it he had passed from broad daylight to complete obscurity from midday to midnight from tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb and by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of the rue polonceau from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity 
 an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappearance into the secret of paris to quit that street where death was on every side for that sort of sepulchre where there was life was a strange instant 
 he remained for several seconds as though bewildered listening stupefied 
 the of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him 
 celestial goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery 
 adorable ambuscades of providence 
 only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse 
 his first sensation was one of blindness 
 all of a sudden he could see nothing 
 it seemed to him too that in one instant he had become deaf 
 he no longer heard anything 
 the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said otherwise than faintly and indistinctly and like a rumbling in the depths he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough 
 he extended one arm and then the other touched the walls on both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was wet he cautiously put forward one foot fearing a hole a sink some gulf he discovered that the paving continued 
 a gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he stood 
 after the lapse of a few minutes he was no longer blind 
 a little light fell through the through which he had descended and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern 
 he began to distinguish something the passage in which he had other word can better express the walled in behind him 
 it was one of those blind alleys which the special jargon terms branches in front of him there was another wall a wall like night the light of the died out ten or twelve paces from the point where jean valjean stood and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer 
 beyond the opaqueness was massive to penetrate thither seemed horrible an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment 
 a man could however plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do 
 haste was even requisite it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the might also catch the eye of the soldiery and that everything hung upon this chance 
 they also might descend into that well and search it 
 there was not a minute to be lost he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is the real word for him on his shoulders once more and set out 
 he plunged resolutely into the gloom 
 the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them perchance 
 after the whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasmas and traps after chaos the sewer jean valjean had fallen from one circle of hell into another 
 when he had advanced fifty paces he was obliged to halt 
 a problem presented itself 
 the passage terminated in another gut which he encountered across his path 
 there two ways presented themselves which should he take 
 ought he to turn to the left or to the right how was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth this labyrinth to which we have already called the attention has a clue which is its slope 
 to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river 
 this jean valjean instantly comprehended 
 he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris 
 perhaps he would come out on some at the intersection of streets 
 amazement of the at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet arrival of the police a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards 
 thus they would be seized before they had even got out it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence for the outcome 
 he ascended the incline and turned to the right 
 when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again 
 nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as possible 
 marius two arms were passed round his neck and the feet dragged behind him 
 he held both these arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other 
 marius cheek touched his and clung there bleeding he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes 
 but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life 
 the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty the rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely run off and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water 
 thus he proceeded in the gloom 
 he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow 
 still little by little whether it was that the distant emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall which he touched now of the vault beneath which he was passing 
 the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there 
 it was not easy to direct his course 
 the line of the sewer so to speak the line of the streets which lie above it 
 there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets 
 let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer the system of sewers existing at that epoch placed end to end would have given a length of eleven leagues 
 we have said above that the actual thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty leagues in extent 
 jean valjean began by committing a blunder 
 he thought that he was beneath the rue and it was a pity that it was not so under the rue there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii 
 and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the ancient cour des miracles and a single branch the sewer whose four arms describe a cross 
 but the gut of the the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinthe has never communicated with the sewer of the rue it ended at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled 
 there opportunities of losing oneself abound 
 the montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network 
 fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of parrots roosts piled on top of each other but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street they are streets presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point first on his left the vast sewer of the platriere a sort of chinese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chaos of ts and zs under the and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as the seine where it terminates in a y secondly on his right the curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which are also blind courts thirdly on his left the branch of the mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of fork and proceeding from to until it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue des jeuneurs without counting little ducts here and there before reaching the belt sewer which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe 
 had jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the rue instead of the ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness economical expedients porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred francs the metre and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits stuff but of all this he knew nothing 
 he advanced with anxiety but with calmness seeing nothing knowing nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence 
 by degrees we will admit a certain horror seized upon him the gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit 
 he walked in an enigma 
 this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable it interlaces in a dizzy fashion 
 it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows 
 jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it 
 in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last 
 how was he to get out should he find an issue should he find it in time would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable would marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night 
 he did not know he put all these questions to himself without replying to them the intestines of paris form a precipice 
 like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster 
 all at once he had a surprise 
 at the most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes the sewer was now descending 
 why 
 was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine 
 this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater 
 he continued to advance 
 it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding 
 the ridge which the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its into the seine and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line

 the darkness was more profound than ever but its very depth reassured him

 jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it

 how was he to get out should he find an issue should he find it in time would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable would marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of that night 
 he did not know he put all these questions to himself without replying to them the intestines of paris form a precipice 
 like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster 
 all at once he had a surprise 
 at the most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes the sewer was now descending 
 why 
 was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine 
 this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater 
 he continued to advance 
 it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding 
 the ridge which the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its into the seine and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line 
 the culminating point which is the point of separation of the currents is in the sewer beyond the rue in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevards and in the montmartre sewer near the halles it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached 
 he was directing his course towards the belt sewer he was on the right path but he did not know it 
 every time that he encountered a branch he felt of its angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet 
 thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated 
 at a certain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris 
 overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder distant but continuous 
 it was the rumbling of vehicles 
 he had been walking for about half an hour at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of rest he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius 
 the darkness was more profound than ever but its very depth reassured him 
 all at once he saw his shadow in front of him 
 it was outlined on a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage stupefied he turned round 
 behind him in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through at a distance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense obscurity flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him 
 it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer 
 in the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a confused way black upright indistinct horrible 
 the sewer and its surprises 
 it was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself 
 still another resemblance between paris and the sea 
 as in the ocean the diver may disappear there 
 the transition was an one 
 in the very heart of the city jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it he had passed from broad daylight to complete obscurity from midday to midnight from tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb and by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of the rue polonceau from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity 
 an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappearance into the secret of paris to quit that street where death was on every side for that sort of sepulchre where there was life was a strange instant 
 he remained for several seconds as though bewildered listening stupefied 
 the of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him 
 celestial goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery 
 adorable ambuscades of providence 
 only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse 
 his first sensation was one of blindness 
 all of a sudden he could see nothing 
 it seemed to him too that in one instant he had become deaf 
 he no longer heard anything 
 the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said otherwise than faintly and indistinctly and like a rumbling in the depths he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough 
 he extended one arm and then the other touched the walls on both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was wet he cautiously put forward one foot fearing a hole a sink some gulf he discovered that the paving continued 
 a gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he stood 
 after the lapse of a few minutes he was no longer blind 
 a little light fell through the through which he had descended and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern 
 he began to distinguish something the passage in which he had other word can better express the walled in behind him 
 it was one of those blind alleys which the special jargon terms branches in front of him there was another wall a wall like night the light of the died out ten or twelve paces from the point where jean valjean stood and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer 
 beyond the opaqueness was massive to penetrate thither seemed horrible an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment 
 a man could however plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do 
 haste was even requisite it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the might also catch the eye of the soldiery and that everything hung upon this chance 
 they also might descend into that well and search it 
 there was not a minute to be lost he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is the real word for him on his shoulders once more and set out 
 he plunged resolutely into the gloom 
 the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them perchance 
 after the whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasmas and traps after chaos the sewer jean valjean had fallen from one circle of hell into another 
 when he had advanced fifty paces he was obliged to halt 
 a problem presented itself 
 the passage terminated in another gut which he encountered across his path 
 there two ways presented themselves which should he take 
 ought he to turn to the left or to the right how was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth this labyrinth to which we have already called the attention has a clue which is its slope 
 to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river 
 this jean valjean instantly comprehended 
 he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris 
 perhaps he would come out on some at the intersection of streets 
 amazement of the at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet arrival of the police a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards 
 thus they would be seized before they had even got out it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence for the outcome 
 he ascended the incline and turned to the right 
 when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again 
 nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as possible 
 marius two arms were passed round his neck and the feet dragged behind him 
 he held both these arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other 
 marius cheek touched his and clung there bleeding he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes 
 but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life 
 the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty the rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely run off and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water 
 thus he proceeded in the gloom 
 he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow 
 still little by little whether it was that the distant emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall which he touched now of the vault beneath which he was passing 
 the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there 
 it was not easy to direct his course 
 the line of the sewer so to speak the line of the streets which lie above it 
 there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets 
 let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer the system of sewers existing at that epoch placed end to end would have given a length of eleven leagues 
 we have said above that the actual thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty leagues in extent 
 jean valjean began by committing a blunder 
 he thought that he was beneath the rue and it was a pity that it was not so under the rue there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii 
 and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the ancient cour des miracles and a single branch the sewer whose four arms describe a cross 
 but the gut of the the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinthe has never communicated with the sewer of the rue it ended at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled

 book fifteen 
 chapter xv 
 
 at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned he called on count rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to leave for petersburg two days later everybody was celebrating the victory everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city everyone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him and everyone questioned him about what he had seen pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to him whether important or quite trifling such as where would he live was he going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone he replied yes perhaps or i think so and so on 
 he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of natasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he had aroused in himself 
 on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys that princess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and last days of prince andrew had often occupied thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in vozdvizhenka street he drove that same evening to see her 
 on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of their friendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the last one at borodino 
 is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them 
 pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood the house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and that she received on sundays 
 announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre 
 yes sir said the man please step into the portrait gallery 
 a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment 
 in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered this must be one of her companions he thought glancing at the lady in the black dress 
 the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand 
 yes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand so this is how we meet again he of spoke of you even at the very last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant 
 i was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time 
 again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierre interrupted her 
 just imagine i knew nothing about him said he i thought he had been killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only know that he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence 
 pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary 
 but when he mentioned the rostovs princess face expressed still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from face to that of the lady in the black dress and said 
 do you really not recognize her 
 pierre looked again at the pale delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgotten and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyes 
 but no it be he thought this stern thin pale face that looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her but at that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficulty effort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking especially at that moment it suffused him seized him and enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was natasha and he loved her 
 at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her to princess mary and above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide his agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly clearer than any words could have done did he betray to himself to her and to princess mary that he loved her 
 no only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he again glanced at natasha and a flush suffused his face and a agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul he became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying 
 pierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect to see her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin and pale but that was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative 
 confusion was not reflected by any confusion on part but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face

 chapter xv 
 
 at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned he called on count rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to leave for petersburg two days later everybody was celebrating the victory everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city everyone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him and everyone questioned him about what he had seen pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to him whether important or quite trifling such as where would he live was he going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone he replied yes perhaps or i think so and so on 
 he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of natasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he had aroused in himself 
 on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys that princess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and last days of prince andrew had often occupied thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in vozdvizhenka street he drove that same evening to see her 
 on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of their friendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the last one at borodino 
 is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them 
 pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood the house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and that she received on sundays 
 announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre 
 yes sir said the man please step into the portrait gallery 
 a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment 
 in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered this must be one of her companions he thought glancing at the lady in the black dress 
 the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand 
 yes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand so this is how we meet again he of spoke of you even at the very last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant 
 i was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time 
 again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierre interrupted her 
 just imagine i knew nothing about him said he i thought he had been killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only know that he fell in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence 
 pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary 
 but when he mentioned the rostovs princess face expressed still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from face to that of the lady in the black dress and said 
 do you really not recognize her 
 pierre looked again at the pale delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgotten and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyes 
 but no it be he thought this stern thin pale face that looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her but at that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficulty effort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking especially at that moment it suffused him seized him and enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was natasha and he loved her

 she has come to stay with me said princess mary the count and countess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful state but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor they insisted on her coming with me 
 yes is there a family free from sorrow now said pierre addressing natasha you know it happened the very day we were rescued i saw him what a delightful boy he was 
 natasha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened and lit up 
 what can one say or think of as a consolation said pierre nothing why had such a splendid boy so full of life to die 
 yes in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarked princess mary 
 yes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted her 
 why is it true natasha asked looking attentively into eyes 
 how can you ask why said princess mary the thought alone of what awaits 
 natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked inquiringly at pierre 
 and because pierre continued only one who believes that there is a god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yours 
 natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary asking about his last days 
 confusion had now almost vanished but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world as he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on natasha he did not purposely say things to please her but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint 
 princess mary reluctantly as is usual in such cases began telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew but face quivering with emotion his questions and his eager restless expression gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake 
 yes yes and so pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story yes yes so he grew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always sought one thing to be perfectly good so he could not be afraid of death the faults he had if he had any were not of his making so he did soften what a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenly turning to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears 
 face twitched she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not 
 yes that was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes for me it certainly was happiness she paused and he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered the room 
 voice broke she blushed pressed her clasped hands on her knees and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly 
 we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare to ask about him then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us i had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i wanted was to see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quickly 
 and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl 
 pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of tears as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of death nor of what she was telling he listened to her and felt only pity for her for what she was suffering now while she was speaking 
 princess mary frowning in her effort to hold back her tears sat beside natasha and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her and love 
 evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale 
 she spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul and it seemed as if she could never finish several times she repeated the same thing twice 
 dessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night 
 well all everything said natasha 
 she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow 
 pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world 
 princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room 
 at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face which resembled his affected pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to the window he wished to take leave of princess mary but she would not let him go 
 no natasha and i sometimes go to sleep till after two so please go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediately 
 before pierre left the room princess mary told him this is the first time she has talked of him like that

 book but the soul 
 chapter iii 
 
 the spun man 
 this justice must be rendered to the police of that period that even in the most serious public junctures it imperturbably fulfilled its duties connected with the sewers and surveillance a revolt was in its eyes no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril 
 the ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the extraordinary service and was not troubled by the latter 
 in the midst of an incalculable political event already begun under the pressure of a possible revolution a police agent spun a thief without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades 
 it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of the th of june on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right shore a little beyond the pont des invalides 
 there is no longer any bank there now 
 the aspect of the locality has changed 
 on that bank two men separated by a certain distance seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other 
 the one who was in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other 
 it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace 
 one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and purposely without wearing the air of doing so 
 the prey was crafty and on its guard 
 the proper relations between the hunted and the hunting dog were observed 
 the one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize him was rude of aspect and must have been rude to encounter 
 the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains 
 the shore was deserted there were no not even a boatman nor a was in the skiffs which were moored here and there 
 it was not easy to see these two men except from the quay opposite and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal being who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse and the other like a classic and official personage wearing the of authority buttoned to the chin 
 perchance the reader might recognize these two men if he were to see them closer at hand 
 what was the object of the second man 
 probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly 
 when a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags it is in order to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state 
 only the whole question lies in the color 
 to be dressed in blue is glorious to be dressed in red is disagreeable 
 there is a purple from below 
 it is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of shirking 
 if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant and to some group worth catching this delicate operation is called spinning 
 what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the man on catching sight from the shore of a on the quay as it was passing along empty made a sign to the driver the driver understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at a this was not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance 
 the rolled along the trees of the the bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen moving along above the parapet 
 one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents contains this article 
 always have on hand a in case of emergency 
 while these two men were manoeuvring each on his own side with irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore and which permitted arriving from passy to come to the river and water their horses this inclined plane was suppressed later on for the sake of symmetry horses may die of thirst but the eye is gratified 
 it is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the a place ornamented with trees but in return much infested with policemen and where the other could easily exercise violence 
 this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from moret in by colonel brack and designated as the house of francois i a guard house is situated close at hand 
 to the great surprise of his watcher the man who was being tracked did not mount by the inclined plane for watering 
 he continued to advance along the quay on the shore 
 his position was visibly becoming critical 
 what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine 
 henceforth there existed no means of ascending to the quay there was no other inclined plane no staircase and they were near the spot marked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and was lost in the water 
 there he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and in front of him and the authorities on his heels 
 it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition or other 
 but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish which one need but skirt the expedient would have been puerile 
 he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing 
 the innocence of thieves does not extend to that point 
 the pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the edge which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay 
 the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went round it so that he ceased to be seen by the other 
 the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly in a few moments he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it there he halted in sheer amazement 
 the man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there 
 total eclipse of the man in the blouse 
 the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty paces long then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the quay 
 the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without being seen by the man who was following him what had become of him 
 the man in the coat walked to the extremity of the shore and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes searching 
 all at once he smote his brow 
 he had just perceived at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a large iron grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges 
 this grating a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay opened on the river as well as on the shore 
 a blackish stream passed under it this stream discharged into the seine 
 beyond the heavy rusty iron bars a sort of dark and vaulted corridor could be descried 
 the man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an air of reproach 
 as this gaze did not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook it it resisted solidly 
 it is probable that it had just been opened although no sound had been heard a singular circumstance in so rusty a grating but it is certain that it had been closed again this indicated that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a key 
 this evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation 
 that is too much 
 a government key 
 then immediately regaining his composure he expressed a whole world of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost ironically 
 come 
 come 
 come 
 come 
 that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should see the man emerge or other men enter he posted himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer 
 the which regulated all its movements on his had in its turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet the coachman foreseeing a prolonged wait encased his horses muzzles in the bag of oats which is damp at the bottom and which is so familiar to parisians to whom be it said in parenthesis the government sometimes applies it 
 the rare on the pont de jena turned their heads before they pursued their way to take a momentary glance at these two motionless items in the landscape the man on the shore the carriage on the quay

 in the midst of an incalculable political event already begun under the pressure of a possible revolution a police agent spun a thief without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades 
 it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of the th of june on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right shore a little beyond the pont des invalides 
 there is no longer any bank there now 
 the aspect of the locality has changed 
 on that bank two men separated by a certain distance seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other 
 the one who was in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other 
 it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace 
 one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and purposely without wearing the air of doing so 
 the prey was crafty and on its guard 
 the proper relations between the hunted and the hunting dog were observed 
 the one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize him was rude of aspect and must have been rude to encounter 
 the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains 
 the shore was deserted there were no not even a boatman nor a was in the skiffs which were moored here and there 
 it was not easy to see these two men except from the quay opposite and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal being who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse and the other like a classic and official personage wearing the of authority buttoned to the chin 
 perchance the reader might recognize these two men if he were to see them closer at hand 
 what was the object of the second man 
 probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly 
 when a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags it is in order to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state 
 only the whole question lies in the color 
 to be dressed in blue is glorious to be dressed in red is disagreeable 
 there is a purple from below 
 it is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of shirking 
 if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant and to some group worth catching this delicate operation is called spinning 
 what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the man on catching sight from the shore of a on the quay as it was passing along empty made a sign to the driver the driver understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at a this was not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance 
 the rolled along the trees of the the bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen moving along above the parapet 
 one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents contains this article 
 always have on hand a in case of emergency 
 while these two men were manoeuvring each on his own side with irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore and which permitted arriving from passy to come to the river and water their horses this inclined plane was suppressed later on for the sake of symmetry horses may die of thirst but the eye is gratified 
 it is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the a place ornamented with trees but in return much infested with policemen and where the other could easily exercise violence 
 this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from moret in by colonel brack and designated as the house of francois i a guard house is situated close at hand 
 to the great surprise of his watcher the man who was being tracked did not mount by the inclined plane for watering 
 he continued to advance along the quay on the shore 
 his position was visibly becoming critical 
 what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine 
 henceforth there existed no means of ascending to the quay there was no other inclined plane no staircase and they were near the spot marked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and was lost in the water 
 there he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and in front of him and the authorities on his heels 
 it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition or other 
 but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish which one need but skirt the expedient would have been puerile 
 he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing 
 the innocence of thieves does not extend to that point 
 the pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the edge which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay 
 the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went round it so that he ceased to be seen by the other 
 the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly in a few moments he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it there he halted in sheer amazement 
 the man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there 
 total eclipse of the man in the blouse 
 the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty paces long then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the quay 
 the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without being seen by the man who was following him what had become of him 
 the man in the coat walked to the extremity of the shore and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes searching 
 all at once he smote his brow 
 he had just perceived at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a large iron grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges 
 this grating a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay opened on the river as well as on the shore 
 a blackish stream passed under it this stream discharged into the seine 
 beyond the heavy rusty iron bars a sort of dark and vaulted corridor could be descried 
 the man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an air of reproach 
 as this gaze did not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook it it resisted solidly 
 it is probable that it had just been opened although no sound had been heard a singular circumstance in so rusty a grating but it is certain that it had been closed again this indicated that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a key 
 this evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation 
 that is too much 
 a government key 
 then immediately regaining his composure he expressed a whole world of interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost ironically 
 come 
 come 
 come 
 come 
 that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should see the man emerge or other men enter he posted himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer 
 the which regulated all its movements on his had in its turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet the coachman foreseeing a prolonged wait encased his horses muzzles in the bag of oats which is damp at the bottom and which is so familiar to parisians to whom be it said in parenthesis the government sometimes applies it 
 the rare on the pont de jena turned their heads before they pursued their way to take a momentary glance at these two motionless items in the landscape the man on the shore the carriage on the quay

 pierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha natasha was calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk it is impossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles is awkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation they went silently to table the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and resolving to break the silence looked at natasha and at princess mary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy 
 do you take vodka count asked princess mary and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past now tell us about yourself said she one hears such improbable wonders about you 
 yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or ought to have happened to me stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought to tell of my experiences in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now people invite me out and tell me all about myself 
 natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking 
 we have been told princess mary interrupted her that you lost two millions in moscow is that true 
 but i am three times as rich as before returned pierre 
 though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his debts and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before 
 what i have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but did not continue noticing that this theme was too egotistic 
 and are you building 
 yes savelich says i must 
 tell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided to remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing that her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended 
 no answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to his words i heard of it in orel and you cannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple he added quickly glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terribly when two people quarrel they are always both in fault and own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive and then such a death without friends and without consolation i am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on face 
 yes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princess mary 
 pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at natasha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold stern and he fancied even contemptuous 
 and did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been told said princess mary 
 pierre laughed 
 no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being guest not only did i never see him but i heard nothing about him i was in much lower company 
 supper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so 
 but true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natasha asked with a slight smile i guessed it then when we met at the sukharev tower do you remember 
 pierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led by princess questions and especially by into giving a detailed account of his adventures 
 at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man in recollection strong impressions he has lived through 
 princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at natasha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness natasha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that never wandered evidently herself experiencing all that he described not only her look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to but could not express in words the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this it was an awful sight children abandoned some in the flames one was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed and grew confused then a patrol arrived and all the men all those who were not looting that is were arrested and i among them 
 i am sure not telling us everything i am sure you did something said natasha and pausing added something fine 
 pierre continued when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details but natasha insisted that he should not omit anything 
 pierre began to tell about karataev but paused by this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room natasha following him with her eyes then he added 
 no you understand what i learned from that illiterate man that simple fellow 
 yes yes go on said natasha where is he 
 they killed him almost before my eyes 
 and pierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the last days of their retreat of illness and his death 
 he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now as it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself natasha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a word no single quiver in voice no look no twitch of a muscle in his face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secret meaning of all mental travail 
 princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw the possibility of love and happiness between natasha and pierre and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness 
 it was three in the morning the footmen came in with sad and stern faces to change the candles but no one noticed them 
 pierre finished his story natasha continued to look at him intently with bright attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess mary was silent it occurred to none of them that it was three and time to go to bed 
 people speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked pierre but if at this moment i were asked would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner or go through all this again then for sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh we imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost but it is only then that what is new and good begins while there is life there is happiness there is much much before us i say this to you he added turning to natasha 
 yes yes she said answering something quite different i too should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning 
 pierre looked intently at her 
 yes and nothing more said natasha 
 not true not true cried pierre i am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live nor you either 
 suddenly natasha bent her head covered her face with her hands and began to cry 
 what is it natasha said princess mary 
 nothing nothing she smiled at pierre through her tears good night it is time for bed 
 pierre rose and took his leave 
 princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom they talked of what pierre had told them princess mary did not express her opinion of pierre nor did natasha speak of him 
 well good night mary said natasha do you know i am often afraid that by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for fear of not doing justice to our feelings we forget him 
 princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of remark but she did not express agreement in words 
 is it possible to forget said she 
 it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard and painful but good very good said natasha i am sure he really loved him that is why i told him was it all right she added suddenly blushing 
 to tell pierre oh yes what a splendid man he is said princess mary 
 do you know mary natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time he has somehow grown so clean smooth and fresh as if he had just come out of a russian bath do you understand out of a moral bath it true 
 yes replied princess mary he has greatly improved 
 with a short coat and his hair cropped just as if well just as if he had come straight from the bath papa used to 
 i understand why he prince andrew liked no one so much as him said princess mary 
 yes and yet he is quite different they say men are friends when they are quite different that must be true really he is quite unlike him in everything 
 yes but wonderful 
 well good night said natasha

 he also bears his cross 
 jean valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused 
 this march became more and more laborious 
 the level of these vaults varies the average height is about five feet six inches and has been calculated for the stature of a man jean valjean was forced to bend over in order not to strike marius against the vault at every step he had to bend then to rise and to feel incessantly of the wall 
 the moisture of the stones and the viscous nature of the timber framework furnished but poor supports to which to cling either for hand or foot 
 he stumbled along in the hideous of the city 
 the intermittent gleams from the only appeared at very long intervals and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon all the rest was mist miasma opaqueness blackness 
 jean valjean was both hungry and thirsty especially thirsty and this like the sea was a place full of water where a man cannot drink 
 his strength which was prodigious as the reader knows and which had been but little decreased by age thanks to his chaste and sober life began to give way nevertheless 
 fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength decreased it made the weight of his burden increase 
 marius who was perhaps dead weighed him down as inert bodies weigh 
 jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible 
 between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats one of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air reached him through the of the mouths of the sewer and him 
 it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the 
 he was at first astonished at this sudden widening 
 he found himself all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls and beneath a vault which his head did not touch the grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high 
 at the point where the montmartre sewer joins the grand sewer two other subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence and that of the abattoir form a square 
 between these four ways a less sagacious man would have remained undecided 
 jean valjean selected the broadest that is to say the but here the question again came he descend or ascend he thought that the situation required haste and that he must now gain the seine at any risk 
 in other terms he must descend he turned to the left 
 it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other towards passy and that it is as its name indicates the subterranean girdle of the paris on the right bank 
 the grand sewer which is it must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of menilmontant terminates if one ascends it in a blind sack that is to say at its ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the knoll of menilmontant 
 there is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of paris beginning with the quartier popincourt and which falls into the seine through the amelot sewer above the ancient isle louviers this branch which completes the collecting sewer is separated from it under the rue menilmontant itself by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters between upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall 
 he would have been lost 
 in case of necessity by retracing his steps a little way and entering the passage of the on condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucherat and by taking the corridor then the gut on the left then turning to the right and avoiding the gallery he might have reached the amelot sewer and thence provided that he did not go astray in the sort of f which lies under the bastille he might have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal but in order to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings 
 now we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing and had any one asked him in what he was he would have answered in the night 
 his instinct served him well 
 to descend was in fact possible safety 
 he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue and the long bifurcated corridor of the chaussee 
 a little beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch he halted 
 he was extremely weary 
 a passably large probably the in the rue furnished a light that was almost vivid jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the banquette of the sewer 
 marius face appeared under the wan light of the like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb his eyes were closed his hair was plastered down on his temples like a brushes dried in red wash his hands hung limp and dead 
 a clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat his limbs were cold and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh jean valjean pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers laid his hand upon marius breast his heart was still beating jean valjean tore up his shirt bandaged the young wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred 
 on disarranging marius garments he had found two things in his pockets the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening and marius pocketbook 
 he ate the roll and opened the pocketbook on the first page he found the four lines written by marius the reader will recall them 
 my name is marius pontmercy 
 carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand rue des no in the marais 
 jean valjean read these four lines by the light of the and remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought repeating in a low tone 
 rue des number monsieur gillenormand 
 he replaced the pocketbook in marius pocket 
 he had eaten his strength had returned to him he took marius up once more upon his back placed the head carefully on his right shoulder and resumed his descent of the sewer 
 the grand sewer directed according to the course of the valley of menilmontant is about two leagues long 
 it is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent 
 this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are illuminating for the reader jean subterranean march jean valjean himself did not possess 
 nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing nor what way he had made only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become intermittent instead of continuous then having almost ceased he concluded that he was no longer under central paris and that he was approaching some solitary region in the vicinity of the outer boulevards or the extreme outer quays where there are fewer houses and streets the sewer has fewer the gloom deepened around jean valjean 
 nevertheless he continued to advance groping his way in the dark 
 suddenly this darkness became terrible

 fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength decreased it made the weight of his burden increase 
 marius who was perhaps dead weighed him down as inert bodies weigh 
 jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible 
 between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats one of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air reached him through the of the mouths of the sewer and him 
 it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the 
 he was at first astonished at this sudden widening 
 he found himself all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls and beneath a vault which his head did not touch the grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high 
 at the point where the montmartre sewer joins the grand sewer two other subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence and that of the abattoir form a square 
 between these four ways a less sagacious man would have remained undecided 
 jean valjean selected the broadest that is to say the but here the question again came he descend or ascend he thought that the situation required haste and that he must now gain the seine at any risk 
 in other terms he must descend he turned to the left 
 it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other towards passy and that it is as its name indicates the subterranean girdle of the paris on the right bank 
 the grand sewer which is it must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of menilmontant terminates if one ascends it in a blind sack that is to say at its ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the knoll of menilmontant 
 there is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of paris beginning with the quartier popincourt and which falls into the seine through the amelot sewer above the ancient isle louviers this branch which completes the collecting sewer is separated from it under the rue menilmontant itself by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters between upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall 
 he would have been lost 
 in case of necessity by retracing his steps a little way and entering the passage of the on condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucherat and by taking the corridor then the gut on the left then turning to the right and avoiding the gallery he might have reached the amelot sewer and thence provided that he did not go astray in the sort of f which lies under the bastille he might have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal but in order to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings 
 now we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing and had any one asked him in what he was he would have answered in the night 
 his instinct served him well 
 to descend was in fact possible safety 
 he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue and the long bifurcated corridor of the chaussee 
 a little beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch he halted 
 he was extremely weary 
 a passably large probably the in the rue furnished a light that was almost vivid jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the banquette of the sewer 
 marius face appeared under the wan light of the like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb his eyes were closed his hair was plastered down on his temples like a brushes dried in red wash his hands hung limp and dead 
 a clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat his limbs were cold and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh jean valjean pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers laid his hand upon marius breast his heart was still beating jean valjean tore up his shirt bandaged the young wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred 
 on disarranging marius garments he had found two things in his pockets the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening and marius pocketbook 
 he ate the roll and opened the pocketbook on the first page he found the four lines written by marius the reader will recall them 
 my name is marius pontmercy 
 carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand rue des no in the marais 
 jean valjean read these four lines by the light of the and remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought repeating in a low tone 
 rue des number monsieur gillenormand 
 he replaced the pocketbook in marius pocket 
 he had eaten his strength had returned to him he took marius up once more upon his back placed the head carefully on his right shoulder and resumed his descent of the sewer 
 the grand sewer directed according to the course of the valley of menilmontant is about two leagues long 
 it is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent 
 this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are illuminating for the reader jean subterranean march jean valjean himself did not possess 
 nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing nor what way he had made only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become intermittent instead of continuous then having almost ceased he concluded that he was no longer under central paris and that he was approaching some solitary region in the vicinity of the outer boulevards or the extreme outer quays where there are fewer houses and streets the sewer has fewer the gloom deepened around jean valjean 
 nevertheless he continued to advance groping his way in the dark 
 suddenly this darkness became terrible

 chapter xviii 
 
 it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he paced up and down his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing and now smiling happily 
 he was thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their love at one moment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that feeling it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room 
 well to be done if it cannot be avoided to be done evidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressing he got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision 
 strange and impossible as such happiness seems i must do everything that she and i may be man and wife he told himself 
 a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the friday when he awoke on the thursday savelich came to ask him about packing for the journey 
 what to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburg he asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long ago before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg he reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good fellow he is and how attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking at old face and what a pleasant smile he has 
 well savelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierre asked him 
 the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under the late count the kingdom of heaven be his and we have lived under you too without ever being wronged 
 and your children 
 the children will live just the same with such masters one can live 
 but what about my heirs said pierre supposing i suddenly marry it might happen he added with an involuntary smile 
 if i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing 
 how easy he thinks it thought pierre he know how terrible it is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible 
 so what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savelich 
 no put it off for a bit tell you later you must forgive the trouble i have put you to said pierre and seeing savelich smile he thought but how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no petersburg for me and that that must be settled first of all but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending shall i have a talk with him and see what he thinks pierre reflected no another time 
 at breakfast pierre told the princess his cousin that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there met whom do you think natasha rostova 
 the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen anna semenovna 
 do you know her asked pierre 
 i have seen the princess she replied i heard that they were arranging a match for her with young rostov it would be a very good thing for the rostovs they are said to be utterly ruined 
 no i mean do you know natasha rostova 
 i heard about that affair of hers at the time it was a great pity 
 no she either understand or is pretending thought pierre better not say anything to her either 
 the princess too had prepared provisions for journey 
 how kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them and all for me 
 on the same day the chief of police came to pierre inviting him to send a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day 
 and this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the chief of police what a fine officer and how kind fancy bothering about such trifies now and they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes what nonsense besides why he take bribes the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what a kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me 
 pierre went to princess to dinner 
 as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and walls of the quarters of the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him of the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the women hawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say ah there he is see what will come of it 
 at the entrance to princess house pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen natasha and talked to her perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and find no one there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom she was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before yet she was quite different had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her 
 she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince fiancee a bright questioning light shone in her eyes and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression 
 pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there but princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with her 
 next day he came early dined and stayed the whole evening though princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all interest was now centered in that house by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha exchanged glances evidently wondering when he would go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt uneasy and embarrassed but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave 
 princess mary foreseeing no end to this rose first and complaining of a headache began to say good night 
 so you are going to petersburg tomorrow she asked 
 no i am not going pierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and as though offended yes no to petersburg tomorrow but i say yet i will call round in case you have any commissions for me said he standing before princess mary and turning red but not taking his departure 
 natasha gave him her hand and went out princess mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off with a deep and sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk 
 when natasha left the room confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary 
 yes i wanted to tell you said he answering her look as if she had spoken princess help me what am i to do can i hope princess my dear friend listen i know it all i know i am not worthy of her i know impossible to speak of it now but i want to be a brother to her no not that i i 
 he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands 
 well he went on with an evident effort at and coherence i know when i began to love her but i have loved her and her alone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine life without her i cannot propose to her at present but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that possibility that possibility is terrible tell me can i hope tell me what i am to do dear princess he added after a pause and touched her hand as she did not reply 
 i am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary this is what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love at present 
 princess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of love was impossible but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierre spoke of his love but that it was the very thing she wished for 
 to speak to her now do said the princess all the same 
 but what am i to do 
 leave it to me said princess mary i know 
 pierre was looking into princess eyes 
 well well he said 
 i know that she loves will love you princess mary corrected herself 
 before her words were out pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized princess hand 
 what makes you think so you think i may hope you think 
 yes i think so said princess mary with a smile write to her parents and leave it to me i will tell her when i can i wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will 
 no it cannot be how happy i am but it be how happy i am no it be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess hands 
 go to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you she said 
 to petersburg go there very well go but i may come again tomorrow 
 next day pierre came to say natasha was less animated than she had been the day before but that day as he looked at her pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it possible no it be he told himself at every look gesture and word that filled his soul with joy 
 when on saying he took her thin slender hand he could not help holding it a little longer in his own 
 is it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will one day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no impossible 
 count she said aloud i shall look forward very much to your return she added in a whisper 
 and these simple words her look and the expression on her face which accompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shall look forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say it yes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy i am what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himself

 book but the soul 
 chapter v 
 
 in the case of sand as in that of woman there is a fineness which is treacherous 
 he felt that he was entering the water and that he no longer had a pavement under his feet but only mud 
 it sometimes happens that on certain shores of bretagne or scotland a man either a traveller or a fisherman while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore suddenly notices that for several minutes past he has been walking with some difficulty the beach under foot is like pitch his soles stick fast to it it is no longer sand it is the strand is perfectly dry but at every step that he takes as soon as the foot is raised the print is filled with water 
 the eye however has perceived no change the immense beach is smooth and tranquil all the sand has the same aspect nothing distinguishes the soil that is solid from that which is not solid the joyous little cloud of continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the 
 the man pursues his way he walks on turns towards the land endeavors to approach the shore 
 he is not uneasy 
 uneasy about what only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes 
 all at once he sinks in he sinks in two or three inches 
 decidedly he is not on the right road he halts to get his bearings 
 suddenly he glances at his feet his feet have disappeared 
 the sand has covered them 
 he draws his feet out of the sand he tries to retrace his steps he turns back he sinks in more deeply than before 
 the sand is up to his ankles he tears himself free from it and flings himself to the left the sand reaches to he flings himself to the right the sand comes up to his knees 
 then with indescribable terror he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish can swim 
 he flings away his burden if he have one he lightens himself like a ship in distress it is too late the sand is above his knees 
 he shouts he waves his hat or his handkerchief the sand continually gains on him if the beach is deserted if the land is too far away if the bank of sand is too there is no hero in the neighborhood all is over he is condemned to be engulfed he is condemned to that terrible interment long infallible implacable which it is impossible to either retard or hasten which lasts for hours which will not come to an end which seizes you erect free in the flush of health which drags you down by the feet which at every effort that you attempt at every shout that you utter draws you a little lower which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp which forces a man to return slowly to earth while leaving him time to survey the horizon the trees the verdant country the smoke of the villages on the plain the sails of the ships on the sea the birds which fly and sing the sun and the sky 
 this engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man 
 each minute is an inexorable of the dead the wretched man tries to sit down to lie down to climb every movement that he makes buries him deeper he straightens himself up he sinks he feels that he is being swallowed up he shrieks implores cries to the clouds wrings his hands grows desperate 
 behold him in the sand up to his belly the sand reaches to his breast he is only a bust now 
 he uplifts his hands utters furious groans clenches his nails on the beach tries to cling fast to that ashes supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath and sobs frantically the sand mounts higher 
 the sand has reached his shoulders the sand reaches to his throat only his face is visible now 
 his mouth cries aloud the sand fills it silence 
 his eyes still gaze forth the sand closes them night 
 then his brow decreases a little hair quivers above the sand a hand projects pierces the surface of the beach waves and disappears 
 sinister obliteration of a man 
 sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse sometimes the carter is swallowed up with his cart all founders in that strand it is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water 
 it is the earth drowning a man 
 the earth permeated with the ocean becomes a pitfall it presents itself in the guise of a plain and it yawns like a wave the abyss is subject to these treacheries 
 this melancholy fate always possible on certain sea beaches was also possible thirty years ago in the sewers of paris 
 before the important works undertaken in the subterranean drain of paris was subject to these sudden slides 
 the water filtered into certain subjacent strata which were particularly friable the which was of as in the ancient sewers or of cement on concrete as in the new galleries having no longer an underpinning gave way a fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack means crumbling the framework crumbled away for a certain length 
 this crevice the hiatus of a gulf of mire was called a fontis in the special tongue what is a fontis 
 it is the quicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth it is the beach of mont in a sewer 
 the soaked soil is in a state of fusion as it were all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium it is not earth and it is not water 
 the depth is sometimes very great 
 nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter if the water predominates death is prompt the man is swallowed up if earth predominates death is slow 
 can any one picture to himself such a death 
 if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore what is it in a instead of the open air the broad daylight the clear horizon those vast sounds those free clouds whence rains life instead of those barks descried in the distance of that hope under all sorts of forms of probable of succor possible up to the very last of all this deafness blindness a black vault the inside of a tomb already prepared death in the mire beneath a cover slow suffocation by filth a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and clutches you by the throat fetidness mingled with the slime instead of the strand sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane dung in place of the ocean 
 and to shout to gnash teeth and to writhe and to struggle and to agonize with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all over head 
 inexpressible is the horror of dying thus 
 death sometimes redeems his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity 
 on the funeral pile in shipwreck one can be great in the flames as in the foam a superb attitude is possible one there becomes transfigured as one perishes but not here 
 death is filthy 
 it is humiliating to expire the supreme floating visions are abject 
 mud is synonymous with shame it is petty ugly infamous 
 to die in a butt of malvoisie like clarence is permissible in the ditch of a scavenger like escoubleau is horrible 
 to struggle therein is hideous at the same time that one is going through the death agony one is floundering about 
 there are shadows enough for hell and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough and the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre or a frog 
 everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister here it is deformed 
 the depth of the fontis varied as well as their length and their density according to the more or less bad quality of the sometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep sometimes eight or ten sometimes the bottom was unfathomable 
 here the mire was almost solid there almost liquid 
 in the luniere fontis it would have taken a man a day to disappear while he would have been devoured in five minutes by the philippeaux slough 
 the mire bears up more or less according to its density 
 a child can escape where a man will perish the first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load every sewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools or his or his hod 
 the fontis were due to different causes 
 the friability of the soil some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man the violent summer rains the incessant flooding of winter long drizzling showers sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust 
 in this manner the heaping up of the parthenon obliterated a century ago a portion of the vaults of hill 
 when a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses the mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space like the teeth of a saw between the this crevice was developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault and then the evil being visible the remedy could be promptly applied it also frequently happened that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar and in that case woe to the sewermen when they entered without precaution into the sewer they were liable to be lost 
 ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner 
 they give many names among others that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under the of the rue a certain blaise poutrain this blaise poutrain was the brother of nicholas poutrain who was the last of the cemetery called the charnier des innocents in the epoch when that cemetery expired 
 there was also that young and charming vicomte of whom we have just spoken one of the heroes of the siege of lerida where they delivered the assault in silk stockings with violins at their head surprised one night at his the duchess de sourdis was drowned in a quagmire of the beautreillis sewer in which he had taken refuge in order to escape from the duke madame de sourdis when informed of his death demanded her and forgot to weep through sniffling at her salts in such cases there is no love which holds fast the sewer extinguishes it 
 hero refuses to wash the body of leander thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and says 
 phew

 it sometimes happens that on certain shores of bretagne or scotland a man either a traveller or a fisherman while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore suddenly notices that for several minutes past he has been walking with some difficulty the beach under foot is like pitch his soles stick fast to it it is no longer sand it is the strand is perfectly dry but at every step that he takes as soon as the foot is raised the print is filled with water 
 the eye however has perceived no change the immense beach is smooth and tranquil all the sand has the same aspect nothing distinguishes the soil that is solid from that which is not solid the joyous little cloud of continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the 
 the man pursues his way he walks on turns towards the land endeavors to approach the shore 
 he is not uneasy 
 uneasy about what only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes 
 all at once he sinks in he sinks in two or three inches 
 decidedly he is not on the right road he halts to get his bearings 
 suddenly he glances at his feet his feet have disappeared 
 the sand has covered them 
 he draws his feet out of the sand he tries to retrace his steps he turns back he sinks in more deeply than before 
 the sand is up to his ankles he tears himself free from it and flings himself to the left the sand reaches to he flings himself to the right the sand comes up to his knees 
 then with indescribable terror he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish can swim 
 he flings away his burden if he have one he lightens himself like a ship in distress it is too late the sand is above his knees 
 he shouts he waves his hat or his handkerchief the sand continually gains on him if the beach is deserted if the land is too far away if the bank of sand is too there is no hero in the neighborhood all is over he is condemned to be engulfed he is condemned to that terrible interment long infallible implacable which it is impossible to either retard or hasten which lasts for hours which will not come to an end which seizes you erect free in the flush of health which drags you down by the feet which at every effort that you attempt at every shout that you utter draws you a little lower which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp which forces a man to return slowly to earth while leaving him time to survey the horizon the trees the verdant country the smoke of the villages on the plain the sails of the ships on the sea the birds which fly and sing the sun and the sky 
 this engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man 
 each minute is an inexorable of the dead the wretched man tries to sit down to lie down to climb every movement that he makes buries him deeper he straightens himself up he sinks he feels that he is being swallowed up he shrieks implores cries to the clouds wrings his hands grows desperate 
 behold him in the sand up to his belly the sand reaches to his breast he is only a bust now 
 he uplifts his hands utters furious groans clenches his nails on the beach tries to cling fast to that ashes supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath and sobs frantically the sand mounts higher 
 the sand has reached his shoulders the sand reaches to his throat only his face is visible now 
 his mouth cries aloud the sand fills it silence 
 his eyes still gaze forth the sand closes them night 
 then his brow decreases a little hair quivers above the sand a hand projects pierces the surface of the beach waves and disappears 
 sinister obliteration of a man 
 sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse sometimes the carter is swallowed up with his cart all founders in that strand it is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water 
 it is the earth drowning a man 
 the earth permeated with the ocean becomes a pitfall it presents itself in the guise of a plain and it yawns like a wave the abyss is subject to these treacheries 
 this melancholy fate always possible on certain sea beaches was also possible thirty years ago in the sewers of paris 
 before the important works undertaken in the subterranean drain of paris was subject to these sudden slides 
 the water filtered into certain subjacent strata which were particularly friable the which was of as in the ancient sewers or of cement on concrete as in the new galleries having no longer an underpinning gave way a fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack means crumbling the framework crumbled away for a certain length 
 this crevice the hiatus of a gulf of mire was called a fontis in the special tongue what is a fontis 
 it is the quicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth it is the beach of mont in a sewer 
 the soaked soil is in a state of fusion as it were all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium it is not earth and it is not water 
 the depth is sometimes very great 
 nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter if the water predominates death is prompt the man is swallowed up if earth predominates death is slow 
 can any one picture to himself such a death 
 if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore what is it in a instead of the open air the broad daylight the clear horizon those vast sounds those free clouds whence rains life instead of those barks descried in the distance of that hope under all sorts of forms of probable of succor possible up to the very last of all this deafness blindness a black vault the inside of a tomb already prepared death in the mire beneath a cover slow suffocation by filth a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and clutches you by the throat fetidness mingled with the slime instead of the strand sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane dung in place of the ocean 
 and to shout to gnash teeth and to writhe and to struggle and to agonize with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all over head 
 inexpressible is the horror of dying thus 
 death sometimes redeems his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity 
 on the funeral pile in shipwreck one can be great in the flames as in the foam a superb attitude is possible one there becomes transfigured as one perishes but not here 
 death is filthy 
 it is humiliating to expire the supreme floating visions are abject 
 mud is synonymous with shame it is petty ugly infamous 
 to die in a butt of malvoisie like clarence is permissible in the ditch of a scavenger like escoubleau is horrible 
 to struggle therein is hideous at the same time that one is going through the death agony one is floundering about 
 there are shadows enough for hell and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough and the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre or a frog 
 everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister here it is deformed 
 the depth of the fontis varied as well as their length and their density according to the more or less bad quality of the sometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep sometimes eight or ten sometimes the bottom was unfathomable 
 here the mire was almost solid there almost liquid 
 in the luniere fontis it would have taken a man a day to disappear while he would have been devoured in five minutes by the philippeaux slough 
 the mire bears up more or less according to its density 
 a child can escape where a man will perish the first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load every sewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools or his or his hod 
 the fontis were due to different causes 
 the friability of the soil some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man the violent summer rains the incessant flooding of winter long drizzling showers sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust 
 in this manner the heaping up of the parthenon obliterated a century ago a portion of the vaults of hill 
 when a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses the mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space like the teeth of a saw between the this crevice was developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault and then the evil being visible the remedy could be promptly applied it also frequently happened that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar and in that case woe to the sewermen when they entered without precaution into the sewer they were liable to be lost 
 ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner 
 they give many names among others that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under the of the rue a certain blaise poutrain this blaise poutrain was the brother of nicholas poutrain who was the last of the cemetery called the charnier des innocents in the epoch when that cemetery expired 
 there was also that young and charming vicomte of whom we have just spoken one of the heroes of the siege of lerida where they delivered the assault in silk stockings with violins at their head surprised one night at his the duchess de sourdis was drowned in a quagmire of the beautreillis sewer in which he had taken refuge in order to escape from the duke madame de sourdis when informed of his death demanded her and forgot to weep through sniffling at her salts in such cases there is no love which holds fast the sewer extinguishes it 
 hero refuses to wash the body of leander thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and says 
 phew

 there was nothing in soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of helene 
 he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and whatever made me say je vous aime on the contrary he now repeated in imagination every word that he or natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything but only to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind it all a dream princess mary mistaken am i not too conceited and i believe all this and suddenly princess mary will tell her and she will be sure to smile and say how strange he must be deluding himself he know that he is a man just a man while i i am something altogether different and higher 
 that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now make any plans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it it would be the end of all things everything ended with that 
 a joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapable possessed him the whole meaning of life not for him alone but for the whole world seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only his future happiness sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness he often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention 
 when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that welfare depended on this or that issue of events he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments but at this time he saw everybody both those who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that is what he was feeling and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved 
 when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew prince vasili who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him a pathetic kindly old man much to be pitied 
 often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct 
 i may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but i was not so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time and understood all that is worth understanding in life because because i was happy 
 insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do to discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in people before loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them

 book but the soul 
 chapter vii 
 
 one sometimes runs aground when one fancies that one is disembarking 
 he set out on his way once more 
 however although he had not left his life in the fontis he seemed to have left his strength behind him there 
 that supreme effort had exhausted him 
 his lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall 
 once he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter marius position and he thought that he should have to remain there 
 but if his vigor was dead his energy was not he rose again 
 he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded thus for a hundred paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with the wall 
 he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he raised his eyes and at the extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him he perceived a light 
 this time it was not that terrible light it was good white light 
 it was daylight jean valjean saw the outlet 
 a damned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal 
 jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue he no longer felt marius weight he found his legs once more of steel he ran rather than walked 
 as he approached the outlet became more and more distinctly defined 
 it was a pointed arch lower than the vault which gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in as the vault grew lower the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel a faulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been corrected 
 jean valjean reached the outlet 
 there he halted 
 it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out 
 the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all appearance rarely swung on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous brick 
 the keyhole could be seen and the robust latch deeply sunk in the iron staple 
 the door was plainly it was one of those prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing 
 beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the shore very narrow but sufficient for escape 
 the distant quays paris that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself the broad horizon liberty 
 on the right down stream the bridge of jena was discernible on the left upstream the bridge of the invalides the place would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape 
 it was one of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating 
 it might have been eight in the evening the day was declining 
 jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dry portion of the vaulting then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move 
 the grating did not stir 
 jean valjean seized the bars one after the other in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock 
 not a bar stirred the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their sockets no lever no prying possible 
 the obstacle was invincible there was no means of opening the gate 
 must he then stop there 
 what was he to do 
 what was to become of him 
 he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey which he had already taken 
 besides how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle 
 and after the quagmire was there not the police patrol which assuredly could not be twice avoided and then whither was he to go

 if he were to reach another outlet he would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating 
 every outlet was undoubtedly closed in that manner chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison 
 all was over 
 everything that jean valjean had done was useless exhaustion had ended in failure 
 they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows 
 he turned his back to the grating and fell upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees 
 this was the last drop of anguish

 he was thinking of cosette

 book but the soul 
 chapter vii 
 
 one sometimes runs aground when one fancies that one is disembarking 
 he set out on his way once more 
 however although he had not left his life in the fontis he seemed to have left his strength behind him there 
 that supreme effort had exhausted him 
 his lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall 
 once he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter marius position and he thought that he should have to remain there 
 but if his vigor was dead his energy was not he rose again 
 he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded thus for a hundred paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with the wall 
 he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he raised his eyes and at the extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him he perceived a light 
 this time it was not that terrible light it was good white light 
 it was daylight jean valjean saw the outlet 
 a damned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal 
 jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue he no longer felt marius weight he found his legs once more of steel he ran rather than walked 
 as he approached the outlet became more and more distinctly defined 
 it was a pointed arch lower than the vault which gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in as the vault grew lower the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel a faulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been corrected 
 jean valjean reached the outlet 
 there he halted 
 it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out 
 the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all appearance rarely swung on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous brick 
 the keyhole could be seen and the robust latch deeply sunk in the iron staple 
 the door was plainly it was one of those prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing 
 beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the shore very narrow but sufficient for escape 
 the distant quays paris that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself the broad horizon liberty 
 on the right down stream the bridge of jena was discernible on the left upstream the bridge of the invalides the place would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape 
 it was one of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating 
 it might have been eight in the evening the day was declining 
 jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dry portion of the vaulting then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move 
 the grating did not stir 
 jean valjean seized the bars one after the other in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock 
 not a bar stirred the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their sockets no lever no prying possible 
 the obstacle was invincible there was no means of opening the gate 
 must he then stop there 
 what was he to do 
 what was to become of him 
 he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey which he had already taken 
 besides how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle 
 and after the quagmire was there not the police patrol which assuredly could not be twice avoided and then whither was he to go 
 what direction should he pursue to follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal 
 if he were to reach another outlet he would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating 
 every outlet was undoubtedly closed in that manner chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison 
 all was over 
 everything that jean valjean had done was useless exhaustion had ended in failure 
 they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows 
 he turned his back to the grating and fell upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees 
 this was the last drop of anguish 
 of what was he thinking during this profound depression neither of himself nor of marius

 first epilogue 
 chapter i 
 
 seven years had passed the sea of european history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm but the mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us continued to operate 
 though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time various groups of people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation 
 the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously it was seething in its depths historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before they now seemed to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the head of armies who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars campaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations laws and treaties 
 the historians call this activity of the historical figures the reaction 
 in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who in their opinion caused what they describe as the reaction all the people of that period from alexander and napoleon to madame de stael photius schelling fichte chateaubriand and the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction 
 according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia also and the chief culprit was alexander i the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign being the savior of russia 
 there is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist to learned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign 
 he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he did well and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning of his reign and during but acted badly by giving a constitution to poland forming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakcheev favoring golitsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkov and photius he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the semenov regiment 
 it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity 
 what do these reproaches mean 
 do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle with napoleon the firmness he displayed in and the campaign of flow from the same sources the circumstances of his birth education and life that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration of poland and the reaction of and later also flowed 
 in what does the substance of those reproaches lie 
 it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to those strongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and inseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truth that this character though not lacking in virtue the historians do not accuse him of that had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning that is with books and lectures and with taking notes from them 
 but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watching the movement of history we see that every year and with each new writer opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that what once seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa and what is more we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving a constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in alexander while others regard it as blameworthy 
 the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful if that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good whether the preservation of my house in moscow or the glory of the russian arms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities or the freedom of poland or the greatness of russia or the balance of power in europe or a certain kind of european culture called progress appear to me to be good or bad i must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me 
 but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events let us say that alexander could have done everything differently let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him of nationality freedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated and that alexander had acted on it what would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent their activity would not have existed there would have been no life there would have been nothing 
 if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility of life is destroyed

 book but the soul 
 chapter viii 
 
 the torn 
 in the midst of this prostration a hand was laid on his shoulder and a low voice said to him 
 half shares 
 some person in that gloom 
 nothing so closely resembles a dream as despair 
 jean valjean thought that he was dreaming he had heard no footsteps 
 was it possible 
 he raised his eyes 
 a man stood before him 
 this man was clad in a blouse his feet were bare he held his shoes in his left hand he had evidently removed them in order to reach jean valjean without allowing his steps to be heard 
 jean valjean did not hesitate for an instant 
 unexpected as was this encounter this man was known to him 
 the man was thenardier 
 although awakened so to speak with a start jean valjean accustomed to alarms and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly parried instantly regained possession of his presence of mind 
 moreover the situation could not be made worse a certain degree of distress is no longer capable of a crescendo and thenardier himself could add nothing to this blackness of this night 
 a momentary pause ensued 
 thenardier raising his right hand to a level with his forehead formed with it a shade then he brought his eyelashes together by screwing up his eyes a motion which in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man 
 he did not succeed jean valjean as we have just stated had his back turned to the light and he was moreover so disfigured so bemired so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full noonday 
 on the contrary illuminated by the light from the grating a cellar light it is true livid yet precise in its lividness thenardier as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it immediately leaped into jean eyes 
 this inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to jean valjean in that mysterious duel 
 which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men 
 the encounter took place between jean valjean veiled and thenardier unmasked 
 jean valjean immediately perceived that thenardier did not recognize him 
 they surveyed each other for a moment in that as though taking each measure 
 thenardier was the first to break the silence 
 how are you going to manage to get out 
 jean valjean made no reply 
 thenardier continued 
 impossible to pick the lock of that gate 
 but still you must get out of this 
 that is true said jean valjean 
 well half shares then 
 what do you mean by that 
 you have killed that man all right 
 i have the key 
 thenardier pointed to marius 
 he went on 
 i know you but i want to help you 
 you must be a friend 
 jean valjean began to comprehend 
 thenardier took him for an assassin 
 thenardier resumed 
 listen comrade 
 you kill that man without looking to see what he had in his pockets 
 give me my half 
 open the door for you 
 and half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key he added 
 do you want to see how a key to liberty is made 
 look here 
 jean valjean remained expression belongs to the elder such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real 
 it was providence appearing in horrible guise and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of thenardier 
 thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean 
 hold on said he give you the rope to boot 
 what is the rope for 
 you will need a stone also but you can find one outside a heap of rubbish 
 what am i to do with a stone 
 idiot want to sling that stiff into the river need a stone and a rope otherwise it would float on the water 
 jean valjean took the rope 
 there is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way 
 thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him 
 ah see here comrade how did you contrive to get out of that slough yonder 
 i dared to risk myself in it 
 phew you smell good 
 after a pause he added 
 asking you questions but perfectly right not to answer an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate 
 and then when you talk at all you run no risk of talking too loud 
 no matter as i see your face and as i know your name you are wrong in supposing that i know who you are and what you want 
 i twig broken up that gentleman a bit now you want to tuck him away somewhere 
 the river that great hider of folly is what you want get you out of your scrape 
 helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair 
 while expressing his approval of jean silence he endeavored to force him to talk 
 he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile and he exclaimed without however raising his tone 
 apropos of that quagmire a hearty animal 
 why you toss the man in there 
 jean valjean preserved silence 
 thenardier resumed pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the level of his apple a gesture which completes the capable air of a serious man 
 after all you acted wisely 
 the workmen when they come to stop up that hole would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there and it might have been possible thread by thread straw by straw to pick up the scent and reach you 
 some one has passed through the sewer 
 who 
 where did he get out 
 was he seen to come out the police are full of cleverness 
 the sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you 
 such a find is a rarity it attracts attention very few people make use of the sewers for their affairs while the river belongs to everybody 
 the river is the true grave at the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets at well what does one care for that 
 carrion who killed that man 
 paris 
 and justice makes no inquiries you have done well 
 the more loquacious thenardier became the more mute was jean valjean 
 again thenardier shook him by the shoulder 
 now settle this business 
 go shares 
 you have seen my key show me your money 
 thenardier was haggard fierce suspicious rather menacing yet amicable 
 there was one singular circumstance manners were not simple he had not the air of being wholly at his ease while affecting an air of mystery he spoke low from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth and muttered hush 
 it was difficult to divine why 
 there was no one there except themselves jean valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook not very far off and that thenardier did not care to share with them 
 thenardier resumed 
 settle up 
 how much did the stiff have in his bags 
 jean valjean searched his pockets 
 it was his habit as the reader will remember to always have some money about him 
 the mournful life of expedients to which he had been condemned imposed this as a law upon him 
 on this occasion however he had been caught unprepared 
 when donning his uniform of a national guardsman on the preceding evening he had forgotten dolefully absorbed as he was to take his he had only some small change in his fob 
 he turned out his pocket all soaked with ooze and spread out on the banquette of the vault one louis two pieces and five or six large sous 
 thenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck 
 you knocked him over cheap said he 
 he set to feeling the pockets of jean valjean and marius with the greatest familiarity 
 jean valjean who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light let him have his way 
 while handling marius coat thenardier with the skill of a pickpocket and without being noticed by jean valjean tore off a strip which he concealed under his blouse probably thinking that this morsel of stuff might serve later on to identify the assassinated man and the assassin 
 however he found no more than the thirty francs 
 true said he both of you together have no more than that 
 and forgetting his motto 
 half shares he took all 
 he hesitated a little over the large sous 
 after due reflection he took them also muttering 
 never mind 
 you cut folks throats too cheap altogether 
 that done he once more drew the big key from under his blouse 
 now my friend you must leave 
 like the fair here you pay when you go out 
 you have paid now clear out 
 and he began to laugh 
 had he in lending to this stranger the aid of his key and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin we may be permitted to doubt this 
 thenardier helped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefooted making jean valjean a sign to follow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection finished he placed the key in the lock 
 the bolt slipped back and the gate swung open 
 it neither grated nor squeaked it moved very softly 
 it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed this softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive goings and comings silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men and the tread of crime 
 the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods 
 thenardier opened the gate a little way allowing just sufficient space for jean valjean to pass out closed the grating again gave the key a double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without making any more noise than a breath he seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger 
 a moment later that hideous providence had retreated into the invisibility 
 jean valjean found himself in the open air

 and he began to laugh 
 had he in lending to this stranger the aid of his key and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin we may be permitted to doubt this 
 thenardier helped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefooted making jean valjean a sign to follow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection finished he placed the key in the lock 
 the bolt slipped back and the gate swung open 
 it neither grated nor squeaked it moved very softly 
 it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed this softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive goings and comings silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men and the tread of crime 
 the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods 
 thenardier opened the gate a little way allowing just sufficient space for jean valjean to pass out closed the grating again gave the key a double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without making any more noise than a breath he seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger 
 a moment later that hideous providence had retreated into the invisibility 
 jean valjean found himself in the open air

 if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends the greatness of russia or of france the balance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of the revolution general progress or anything else then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius 
 if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of russia that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion if the aim wag the aggrandizement of france that might have been attained without the revolution and without the empire if the aim was the dissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare if the aim was the progress of civilization it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives 
 why did it happen in this and not in some other way 
 because it happened so chance created the situation genius utilized it says history 
 but what is chance what is genius 
 the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs i think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about chance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of genius 
 to a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats that this very ram swelling with fat is killed for meat 
 but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius 
 only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and then the words chance and genius become superfluous 
 we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european convulsions and that we know only the facts that is the murders first in france then in italy in africa in prussia in austria in spain and in russia and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in napoleon and alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable 
 by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon and alexander with all their antecedents

 return of the jedi 
 iv 
 
 darth vader stepped out of the long cylindrical elevator into what had been the deathstar control room and now was the throne room two royal guards stoodeither side of the door red robes from neck to toe red helmets covering all buteyeslits that were actually electrically modified their weapons werealways drawn 
 the room was dim except for the light cables running either side of the elevatorshaft carrying power and information through the space station vader walkedacross the sleek black steel floor past the humming giant converter engines up theshort flight of steps to the platform level upon which sat the this platform off to the right was the mouth of the shaft that delved deeplyinto the pit of the battle station down to the very core of the power unit the chasmwas black and reeked of ozone and echoed continuously in a low hollow rumble 
 at the end of the overhanging platform was a wall in the wall a huge circularobservation window sitting in an elaborate before the window staringout into space was the emperor 
 the uncompleted half of the death star could be seen immediately beyond thewindow shuttles and transports buzzing around it men with doing exterior construction or surface work in the all this activity was the jade green moon endor resting like a jewel on theblack velvet of scattered to infinity the gleaming diamonds that were thestars 
 the emperor sat regarding this view as vader approached from behind thelord of sith kneeled and waited the emperor let him wait he perused the vistabefore him with a sense of glory beyond all reckoning this was all his and moreglorious still all his by his own hand 
 for it always so back in the days when he was merely senatorpalpatine the galaxy had been a knighthood that had watched it over it for inevitably it had grown too massive a bureaucracy had been too many years in order to maintain the republic corruption had set in 
 a few greedy senators had started the chain reaction of malaise some said butwho could know a few suddenly a fever was in the stars governor turned ongovernor values eroded trusts were had spread like an epidemic inthose early years rapidly and without visible cause and no one knew what washappening or why 
 and so senator palpatine had seized the moment through fraud cleverpromises and astute political maneuvering managed to get himself elected headof the council and then through subterfuge bribery and terror named himselfemperor 
 emperor it had a certain ring to it the republic had crumbled the empirewas resplendent with its own fires and would always be the emperor knewwhat others refused to believe the dark forces were the strongest 
 known this all along in his heart of relearned it every traitorous lieutenants who betrayed their superiors for favors functionaries who gave him the secrets of lords and sadisticgangsters and politicians no one was immune they all craved thedark energy at their core the emperor had simply recognized this truth andutilized his own aggrandizement of course 
 for his soul was the black center of the empire 
 he contemplated the dense impenetrability of the deep space beyond the black as his if he were in some real way this blackness as if hisinner spirit was itself this void over which he reigned he smiled at the thought hewas the empire he was the universe 
 behind him he sensed vader still waiting in genuflection how long had thedark lord been there five minutes ten the emperor was uncertain nomatter the emperor had not quite finished his meditation 
 lord vader did not mind waiting though nor was he even aware of it for itwas an honor and a noble activity to kneel at his feet he kept his eyesinward seeking reflection in his own bottomless core his power was great than it had ever been it shimmered from within and resonated with thewaves of darkness that flowed from the emperor he felt engorged with this surged like black fire demon electrons looking for groundbut he would his emperor was not ready and his son was not ready and the time was not he waited 
 finally the chair slowly rotated until the emperor faced vader 
 vader spoke first what is thy bidding my master 
 send the fleet to the far side of endor there it will stay until called for 
 and what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust 
 it is of no concern soon the rebellion will be crushed and the youngskywalker will be one of us your work here is finished my friend go out to thecommand ship and await my order 
 yes my master he hoped he would be given command over the destructionof the rebel alliance he hoped it would be soon 
 he rose and exited as the emperor turned back to the galactic panorama beyondthe window to view his domain 
 in a remote and midnight vacuum beyond the edge of the galaxy the vast rebelfleet stretched from its vanguard to its rear echelon past the range of human battle ships cruisers destroyers carriers bombers sullustain cargofreighter calamarian tankers alderaanian gunships kesselian blockade skyhoppers and fighters shuttles transportvehicles manowars every rebel in the galaxy soldier and civilian alike waitedtensely in these ships for instructions they were led by the largest of the rebel starcruisers the headquarters frigate 
 hundreds of rebel commanders of all species and lifeforms assembled in thewar room of the giant star cruiser awaiting orders from the high were everywhere and an air of excitement spread from squadron to squadron 
 at the center of the briefing room was a large circular projectedabove which a holographic image of the unfinished imperial death star hoveredbeside the moon of endor whose scintillating protective deflector shieldencompassed them both 
 mon mothma entered the room a stately beautiful woman of middle age sheseemed to walk above the murmurs of the crowd she wore white robes with goldbraiding and her severity was not without she was the elected leader ofthe rebel alliance 
 like adopted palpatine the emperor mothmahad been a senior senator of the republic a member of the high council when therepublic had begun to crumble mon mothma had remained a senator until the dissent stabilizing the increasingly ineffectual government 
 she had organized cells too toward the end pockets of resistance each ofwhich was unaware of the identity of the of which was responsible forinciting revolt against the empire when it finally made itself manifest 
 there had been other leaders but many were killed when the firstdeath star annihilated the planet alderaan adopted father died in thatcalamity 
 mon mothma went underground she joined her political cells with thethousands of guerrillas and insurgents the cruel dictatorship had more joined this rebel alliance mon mothma became theacknowledged leader of all the creatures who had been left homeless by theemperor homeless but not without hope 
 she traversed the room now to the holographic display where she conferredwith her two chief advisors general madine and admiral ackbar madine resourceful if a bit of martinet ackbar was pure creature with huge sad eyes set in a head andwebbed hands that made him more at home in water or free space than on board aship but if the humans were the arm of the rebellion the calamarians were to say they fight with the best when pushed to the the evil empire had reached that limit 
 lando calrissian made his way through the crowd now scanning faces hesaw wedge who was to be his wing nodded at each other gave sign but then lando moved on wedge the one he was lookingfor he made it to a clearing near the center peered around finally saw his friendsstanding by a side door he smiled and wandered over 
 han chewie leia and the two droids greeted appearance with acacophony of cheers laughs beeps and barks 
 well look at you solo chided straightening the lapel of newuniform and pulling on the insignias a general 
 lando laughed affectionately a man of many faces and many must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of from norulac his stint as governor of cloud out the bandits against all odds using legendary flying and unheard ofstrategies and done it on a bet 
 han opened his eyes wide with sarcasm hey look at me i just toldthem you were a fair pilot i had no idea they were looking for someone to leadthis crazy attack 
 all right i asked for it i want to lead this attack for one thing heliked dressing up like a general people gave him the respect he deserved and have to give up flying circles around some pompous imperial militarypoliceman and that was the other was finally going to stick it to thisimperial navy stick it so it hurt for all the times been stuck stick it and leavehis signature on it general calrissian thank you 
 solo looked at his old friend admiration combined with disbelief have youever seen one of those death stars in for a very short generalship oldbuddy 
 surprised they ask you to do it lando smiled 
 maybe they did han intimated but not crazy the respectableone remember of the bespin cloud city 
 leia moved closer to solo and took his arm protectively han is going to stayon the command ship with both very grateful for what and proud 
 suddenly at the center of the room mon mothma signaled for attention theroom fell silent anticipation was keen 
 the data brought to us by the bothan spies have been confirmed the supremeleader announced the empire has made a critical error and the time for our attackhas come 
 this caused a great stir in the room as if her message had been a valve lettingoff pressure the air hissed with comment she turned to the hologram of the deathstar and went on we now have the exact location of the new battlestation the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational with theimperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it isrelatively unprotected she paused here to let her next statement register its fulleffect most important we have learned the emperor himself is personallyoverseeing the construction 
 a volley of spirited chatter erupted from the assembly this was it thechance the hope no one could hope to hope for a shot at the emperor 
 mon mothma continued when the hubbub died down slightly his trip wasundertaken in the utmost secrecy but he underestimated our spy network manybothans died to bring us this information her voice turned suddenly stern again toremind them of the price of this enterprise 
 admiral ackbar stepped forward his specialty was imperial defenseprocedures he raised his fin and pointed at the holographic model of the force fieldemanating from endor although uncompleted the death star is not entirelywithout a defense mechanism he instructed in soothing calamarian tones it isprotected by an energy shield which is generated by the nearby moon of endor ship can fly through it no weapon can penetrate it he stopped for a longmoment he wanted the information to sink in when he thought it had he spokemore slowly the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be the shield is down the cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly intothe superstructure hereand attempt to hit the main reactor he pointed to theunfinished portion of the death star somewhere in here 
 another murmur swept over the room of commanders like a swell in a heavysea 
 ackbar concluded general calrissian will lead the fighter attack 
 han turned to lando his doubts gilded with respect good luck buddy 
 thanks said lando simply 
 gonna need it 
 admiral ackbar yielded the floor to general madine who was in charge ofcovert operations we have acquired a small imperial shuttle madine declaredsmugly under this guise a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate theshield generator the control bunker is well guarded but a small squad should beable to penetrate its security 
 this news stimulated another round of general mumbling 
 leia turned to han and said under her breath i wonder who they found to pullthat one off 
 madine called out general solo is your strike team assembled 
 leia looked up at han shock quickly melting to joyous admiration she knewthere was a reason she loved spite of his usual crass insensitivity and oafishbravado beneath it all he had heart 
 moreover a change had come over him since he emerged from just a loner selfish edge and had somehow subtly become part of thewhole he was actually doing something for someone else now and that factmoved leia greatly madine had called him general that meant han had let himselfofficially become a member of the army a part of the whole 
 solo responded to madine my squad is ready sir but i need a command crewfor the shuttle he looked questioningly at chewbacca and spoke in a lower gonna be rough old pal i want to speak for you 
 roo roowfl chewbacca shook his head with gruff love and raised his hairypaw 
 one han called 
 two leia shouted sticking her arm in the air then softly to not letting you out of my sight again your generalship 
 and with you too a voice was raised from the back of the room 
 they all turned their heads to see luke standing at the top of the stairs 
 cheers went up for the last of the jedi 
 and though it his style han was unable to conceal his joy he smiled 
 leia ran up to luke and hugged him warmly she felt a special closeness tohim all of a sudden which she attributed to the gravity of the moment the import oftheir mission but then she sensed a change in him too a difference of substancethat seemed to radiate from his very that she alone could see 
 what is it luke she whispered she suddenly wanted to hold him shecould not have said why 
 nothing tell you someday he murmured quietly it was distinctly notnothing though 
 all right she answered not pushing wait she wondered maybehe was just dressed was probably it suited up all in black him look older older that was it 
 han chewie lando wedge and several others crowded around luke all atonce with greetings and diverse sorts of hubbub the assembly as a whole broke upinto multiple such small groups it was a time for last farewells and good graces 
 artoo beeped a singsong little observation to a somewhat less sanguine threepio 
 i think exciting is the right word the golden droid answered being atranslator in his master program of course threepio was most concerned withlocating the right word to describe the present situation 
 the millennium falcon rested in the main docking bay of the rebel star loaded and serviced just beyond it sat the stolen imperial shuttle lookinganomalous in the midst of all the rebel fighters 
 chewie supervised the final transfer of weapons and supplies to the shuttle andoversaw the placement of the strike team han stood with lando between the twoships saying all they knew forever 
 i mean it take her solo insisted indicating the falcon bring youluck you know the fastest ship in the whole fleet now han had reallysouped her up after winning her from lando always been fast but now shewas much faster and the modifications solo added had really made the falcon apart of put his love and sweat into it his spirit so giving her to landonow was truly final selfless a gift as ever given 
 and lando understood thanks old buddy take good care of her youknow i always flew her better than you did anyway she get a scratch on me at the stick 
 solo looked warmly at the endearing rogue got your ascratch 
 take off you thing have me putting down a securitydeposit 
 see you soon pal 
 they parted without their true feelings expressed aloud as was the way betweenmen of deeds in those times each walked up the ramp into a different ship 
 han entered the cockpit of the imperial shuttle as luke was doing some finetuning on a rear navigator panel chewbacca in the seat was trying tofigure out the imperial controls han took the chair and chewbacca growledgrumpily about the design 
 yeah yeah solo answered i think the empire designed it with awookiee in mind 
 leia walked in from the hold taking her seat near luke all set backthere 
 rrrwfr said chewie hitting the first sequence of switches he looked over atsolo but han was motionless staring out the window at something chewie andleia both followed his gaze to the object of his unyielding millenniumfalcon 
 leia gently nudged the pilot hey you awake up there 
 i just got a funny feeling han mused like not going to see her thought of the times saved him with her speed of the times saved withhis cunning or his touch he thought of the universe seen together of theshelter given him of the way he knew her inside and out of the times in each embrace floating still as a quiet dream in the black silence ofdeep space 
 chewbacca hearing this took his own longing look at the falcon leia put herhand on shoulder she knew he had special love for his ship and wasreluctant to interrupt this last communion but time was dear and becoming on captain she whispered move 
 han snapped back to the moment right okay chewie find out whatthis baby can do 
 they fired up the engines in the stolen shuttle eased out of the docking bay andbanked off into the endless night 
 construction on the death star proceeded traffic in the area was thick withtransport ships tie fighters and equipment shuttles periodically the super stardestroyer orbited the area surveying progress on the space station from every angle 
 the bridge of the star destroyer was a hive of activity messengers ran backand forth along a string of controllers studying their tracking screens monitoringingress and egress of vehicles through the deflector shield codes were sent andreceived orders given diagrams plotted it was an operation involving a thousandscurrying ships and everything was proceeding with maximum efficiency untilcontroller jhoff made the shield from sector seven 
 shuttle to control please come in the voice broke into headset withthe normal amount of static 
 we have you on our screen now the controller replied into his identify 
 this is shuttle tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield 
 shuttle tydirium transmit the clearance code for shield passage 
 up in the shuttle han threw a worried look at the others and said into hiscomlink transmission commencing 
 chewie flipped a bank of switches producing a syncopated series transmission noises 
 leia bit her lip bracing herself for fight or flight now we find out if thatcode was worth the price we paid 
 chewie whined nervously 
 luke stared at the huge super star destroyer that loomed everywhere in front ofthem it fixed his eye with its glittering darkness filled his vision like a it made more than his vision opaque it filled his mind with and his heart black fear and a special knowing vader is on that ship hewhispered 
 jittery luke han reassured them all there are lots of commandships but chewie he cautioned keep our distance without looking keeping our distance 
 awroff rwrgh rrfrough 
 i casual han barked back 
 taking a long time with that code clearance leia said tightly whatif it work the alliance could do nothing if the deflector shieldremained functioning leia tried to clear her mind tried to focus on the shieldgenerator she wanted to reach tried to weed away all feelings of doubt or fear shemay have been giving off 
 endangering the mission luke spoke now in a kind of emotionalresonance with his secret sister his thoughts were of vader though their have come 
 han tried to buoy things up hey why we try to be optimistic aboutthis he felt beleaguered by negativity 
 he knows here luke avowed he kept staring at the command ship outthe it seemed to taunt him it awaited 
 come on kid imagining things 
 ararh gragh chewie mumbled even he was grim 
 lord vader stood quite still staring out a large at the death thrilled to the sight of this monument to the dark side of the force icily hecaressed it with his gaze 
 like a floating ornament it sparkled for him a magic globe tiny specks oflight raced across its surface mesmerizing the dark lord as if he were a small childentranced by a special toy it was a transcendant state he was inn a moment ofheightened perceptions 
 and then all at once in the midst of the stillness of his contemplation he grewabsolutely motionless not a breath not even a heartbeat stirred to mar hisconcentration he strained his every sense into the ether what had he felt hisspirit tilted its head to listen some echo some vibration apprehended only by had not passed had swirled the moment and altered the very shapeof things things were no longer the same 
 he walked down the row of controllers until he came to the spot where admiralpiett was leaning over the tracking screen of controller jhoff piett straightened approach then bowed stiffly at the neck 
 where is that shuttle going vader demanded quietly without preliminary 
 piett turned back to the and spoke into the comlink shuttletydirium what is your cargo and destination 
 the filtered voice of the shuttle pilot came back over the receiver parts andtechnical personnel for the sanctuary moon 
 the bridge commander looked to vader for a reaction he hoped nothing wasamiss lord vader did not take mistakes lightly 
 do they have a code clearance vader questioned 
 an older code but it checks out piett replied immediately i was aboutto clear them there was no point in lying to the lord of the sith he alwaysknew if you lied lies sang out to the dark lord 
 i have a strange feeling about that ship vader said more to himself than toanyone else 
 should i hold them piett hurried anxious to please his master 
 no let them pass i will deal with this myself 
 as you wish my lord piett bowed partly to hide his surprise he nodded atcontroller jhoff who spoke into the comlink to shuttle tydirium 
 in the shuttle tydirium the group waited tensely the more questions theywere asked about things like cargo and destination the more likely it seemed theywere going to blow their cover 
 han looked fondly at his old wookiee partner chewie if they go forthis gonna have to beat it quick it was a speech really they allknew this pokey shuttle about to outrun anything in the neighborhood 
 the static voice of the controller broke up and then came in clearly over thecomlink shuttle tydirium deactivation of the shield will commence your present course 
 everyone but luke exhaled in simultaneous relief as if the trouble were all overnow instead of just beginning luke continued to stare at the command ship as ifengaged in some silent complex dialogue 
 chewie barked loudly 
 hey what did i tell you han grinned no sweat 
 leia smiled affectionately is that what you told us 
 solo pushed the throttle forward and the stolen shuttle moved smoothly towardthe green sanctuary moon 
 vader piett and jhoff watched the in the control room as theweblike deflector grid readout parted to admit the shuttle tydirium which movedslowly toward the center of the endor 
 vader turned to the deck officer and spoke with more urgency in his voice thanwas usually heard ready my shuttle i must go to the emperor 
 without waiting for response the dark lord strode off clearly in the thrall of adark thought

 return of the jedi 
 iv 
 
 darth vader stepped out of the long cylindrical elevator into what had been the deathstar control room and now was the throne room two royal guards stoodeither side of the door red robes from neck to toe red helmets covering all buteyeslits that were actually electrically modified their weapons werealways drawn 
 the room was dim except for the light cables running either side of the elevatorshaft carrying power and information through the space station vader walkedacross the sleek black steel floor past the humming giant converter engines up theshort flight of steps to the platform level upon which sat the this platform off to the right was the mouth of the shaft that delved deeplyinto the pit of the battle station down to the very core of the power unit the chasmwas black and reeked of ozone and echoed continuously in a low hollow rumble 
 at the end of the overhanging platform was a wall in the wall a huge circularobservation window sitting in an elaborate before the window staringout into space was the emperor 
 the uncompleted half of the death star could be seen immediately beyond thewindow shuttles and transports buzzing around it men with doing exterior construction or surface work in the all this activity was the jade green moon endor resting like a jewel on theblack velvet of scattered to infinity the gleaming diamonds that were thestars 
 the emperor sat regarding this view as vader approached from behind thelord of sith kneeled and waited the emperor let him wait he perused the vistabefore him with a sense of glory beyond all reckoning this was all his and moreglorious still all his by his own hand 
 for it always so back in the days when he was merely senatorpalpatine the galaxy had been a knighthood that had watched it over it for inevitably it had grown too massive a bureaucracy had been too many years in order to maintain the republic corruption had set in 
 a few greedy senators had started the chain reaction of malaise some said butwho could know a few suddenly a fever was in the stars governor turned ongovernor values eroded trusts were had spread like an epidemic inthose early years rapidly and without visible cause and no one knew what washappening or why 
 and so senator palpatine had seized the moment through fraud cleverpromises and astute political maneuvering managed to get himself elected headof the council and then through subterfuge bribery and terror named himselfemperor 
 emperor it had a certain ring to it the republic had crumbled the empirewas resplendent with its own fires and would always be the emperor knewwhat others refused to believe the dark forces were the strongest 
 known this all along in his heart of relearned it every traitorous lieutenants who betrayed their superiors for favors functionaries who gave him the secrets of lords and sadisticgangsters and politicians no one was immune they all craved thedark energy at their core the emperor had simply recognized this truth andutilized his own aggrandizement of course 
 for his soul was the black center of the empire 
 he contemplated the dense impenetrability of the deep space beyond the black as his if he were in some real way this blackness as if hisinner spirit was itself this void over which he reigned he smiled at the thought hewas the empire he was the universe 
 behind him he sensed vader still waiting in genuflection how long had thedark lord been there five minutes ten the emperor was uncertain nomatter the emperor had not quite finished his meditation 
 lord vader did not mind waiting though nor was he even aware of it for itwas an honor and a noble activity to kneel at his feet he kept his eyesinward seeking reflection in his own bottomless core his power was great than it had ever been it shimmered from within and resonated with thewaves of darkness that flowed from the emperor he felt engorged with this surged like black fire demon electrons looking for groundbut he would his emperor was not ready and his son was not ready and the time was not he waited 
 finally the chair slowly rotated until the emperor faced vader 
 vader spoke first what is thy bidding my master 
 send the fleet to the far side of endor there it will stay until called for 
 and what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust 
 it is of no concern soon the rebellion will be crushed and the youngskywalker will be one of us your work here is finished my friend go out to thecommand ship and await my order 
 yes my master he hoped he would be given command over the destructionof the rebel alliance he hoped it would be soon 
 he rose and exited as the emperor turned back to the galactic panorama beyondthe window to view his domain 
 in a remote and midnight vacuum beyond the edge of the galaxy the vast rebelfleet stretched from its vanguard to its rear echelon past the range of human battle ships cruisers destroyers carriers bombers sullustain cargofreighter calamarian tankers alderaanian gunships kesselian blockade skyhoppers and fighters shuttles transportvehicles manowars every rebel in the galaxy soldier and civilian alike waitedtensely in these ships for instructions they were led by the largest of the rebel starcruisers the headquarters frigate 
 hundreds of rebel commanders of all species and lifeforms assembled in thewar room of the giant star cruiser awaiting orders from the high were everywhere and an air of excitement spread from squadron to squadron 
 at the center of the briefing room was a large circular projectedabove which a holographic image of the unfinished imperial death star hoveredbeside the moon of endor whose scintillating protective deflector shieldencompassed them both 
 mon mothma entered the room a stately beautiful woman of middle age sheseemed to walk above the murmurs of the crowd she wore white robes with goldbraiding and her severity was not without she was the elected leader ofthe rebel alliance 
 like adopted palpatine the emperor mothmahad been a senior senator of the republic a member of the high council when therepublic had begun to crumble mon mothma had remained a senator until the dissent stabilizing the increasingly ineffectual government 
 she had organized cells too toward the end pockets of resistance each ofwhich was unaware of the identity of the of which was responsible forinciting revolt against the empire when it finally made itself manifest 
 there had been other leaders but many were killed when the firstdeath star annihilated the planet alderaan adopted father died in thatcalamity 
 mon mothma went underground she joined her political cells with thethousands of guerrillas and insurgents the cruel dictatorship had more joined this rebel alliance mon mothma became theacknowledged leader of all the creatures who had been left homeless by theemperor homeless but not without hope 
 she traversed the room now to the holographic display where she conferredwith her two chief advisors general madine and admiral ackbar madine resourceful if a bit of martinet ackbar was pure creature with huge sad eyes set in a head andwebbed hands that made him more at home in water or free space than on board aship but if the humans were the arm of the rebellion the calamarians were to say they fight with the best when pushed to the the evil empire had reached that limit 
 lando calrissian made his way through the crowd now scanning faces hesaw wedge who was to be his wing nodded at each other gave sign but then lando moved on wedge the one he was lookingfor he made it to a clearing near the center peered around finally saw his friendsstanding by a side door he smiled and wandered over

 that same evening there was an animated discussion among the officers in quarters 
 and i tell you rostov that you must apologize to the colonel said a tall staff captain with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features to rostov who was crimson with excitement 
 the staff captain kirsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission 
 i will allow no one to call me a liar cried rostov he told me i lied and i told him he lied and there it rests he may keep me on duty every day or may place me under arrest but no one can make me apologize because if he as commander of this regiment thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then 
 you just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache you tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen 
 not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but i am not a diplomatist why i joined the hussars thinking that here one would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lying so let him give me satisfaction 
 all right no one thinks you a coward but not the point ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander 
 denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation evidently with no wish to take part in it he answered the staff question by a disapproving shake of his head 
 you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers continued the staff captain and bogdanich the colonel was called bogdanich shuts you up 
 he did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth 
 well have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize 
 not on any account exclaimed rostov 
 i did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and severely you wish to apologize but man not only to him but to the whole regiment all of us to blame all round the case is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice but no you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers now what was the colonel to do have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel is that how you look at it we see it like that and bogdanich was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true not pleasant but to be done my dear fellow you landed yourself in it and now when one wants to smooth the thing over some conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish to make the whole affair public you are offended at being put on duty a bit but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer whatever bogdanich may be anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel quick at taking offense but you mind disgracing the whole regiment the staff voice began to tremble you have been in the regiment next to no time my lad here today and tomorrow be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said there are thieves among the pavlograd officers but not all the same to us am i not right denisov not the same 
 denisov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at rostov 
 you value your own pride and wish to apologize continued the staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and god willing are going to die in the regiment we prize the honor of the regiment and bogdanich knows it oh we do prize it old fellow and all this is not right not right you may take offense or not but i always stick to mother truth not right 
 and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostov 
 twue devil take it shouted denisov jumping up now then wostov now then 
 rostov growing red and pale alternately looked first at one officer and then at the other 
 no gentlemen no you think i quite understand wrong to think that of me i for me for the honor of the regiment ah well show that in action and for me the honor of the flag well never mind true to blame to blame all round well what else do you want

 gentlemen do anything no one shall hear a word from me said rostov in an imploring voice but i apologize by god i do what you will how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness 
 denisov began to laugh

 chapter 
 
 on the morrow of that monday earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments and therefore remaining about the house i speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me as heretofore she got downstairs before me and out into the garden where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work and when i went to bid them come to breakfast i saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the grange 
 i was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief the trees were the apple of eye and she had just fixed her choice of a flower bed in the midst of them 
 there that will be all shown to the master i exclaimed the minute it is discovered and what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden we shall have a fine explosion on the head of it see if we mr hareton i wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding 
 forgotten they were answered earnshaw rather puzzled but tell him i did it 
 we always ate our meals with mr heathcliff i held the post in making tea and carving so i was indispensable at table catherine usually sat by me but today she stole nearer to hareton and i presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility 
 now mind you talk with and notice your cousin too much were my whispered instructions as we entered the room it will certainly annoy mr heathcliff and be mad at you both 
 not going to she answered 
 the minute after she had sidled to him and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge 
 he dared not speak to her there he dared hardly look and yet she went on teasing till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh and i frowned and then she glanced towards the master whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company as his countenance evinced and she grew serious for an instant scrutinizing him with deep gravity afterwards she turned and recommenced her nonsense at last hareton uttered a smothered laugh mr heathcliff started his eye rapidly surveyed our faces catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance which he abhorred 
 it is well you are out of my reach he exclaimed what fiend possesses you to stare back at me continually with those infernal eyes down with them and remind me of your existence again i thought i had cured you of laughing 
 it was me muttered hareton what do you say demanded the master 
 hareton looked at his plate and did not repeat the confession mr heathcliff looked at him a bit and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing we had nearly finished and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder so i anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting when joseph appeared at the door revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected he must have seen cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud and rendered his speech difficult to understand he began 
 aw mun hev my wage and aw mun goa aw bed aimed tuh dee wheare sarved fur sixty year un aw thowt lug my books up intuh t garret un all my bits uh stuff un they sud hev t kitchen tuh theirseln fur t sake uh quietness it wur hard tuh gie up my awn hearthstun bud aw thowt aw could do that bud nah taan my garden frough me un by th heart maister aw cannot stand it yah muh bend tuh th yoak an ye will aw noan used to t and an man sooin get used tuh new barthens rayther arn my bite an my sup wi a hammer in th road 
 now now idiot interrupted heathcliff cut it short your grievance interfere in no quarrels between you and nelly she may thrust you into the for anything i care 
 noan nelly answered joseph aw shift fur ill nowt as shoo is thank god shoo cannot stale t sowl o shoo wer niver soa handsome bud whet a body mud look at her baht winking yon flaysome graceless quean ut s witched ahr lad wi her bold een un her forrard it fair brusts my heart forgetten all ee done for him un made on him un goan un riven up a whole row ut t grandest currant trees i t garden and here he lamented outright unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries and ingratitude and dangerous condition 
 is the fool drunk asked mr heathcliff hareton is it you finding fault with 
 pulled up two or three bushes replied the young man but going to set em again 
 and why have you pulled them up said the master catherine unwisely put in her tongue 
 we wanted to plant some flowers there she cried the only person to blame for i wished him to do it 
 and who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place demanded her much surprised and who ordered you to obey her he added turning to hareton 
 the latter was speechless his cousin replied 
 you grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament when you have taken all my land 
 your land insolent slut you never had any said heathcliff 
 and my money she continued returning his angry glare and meantime biting a piece of crust the remnant of her breakfast 
 silence he exclaimed get done and begone 
 and land and his money pursued the reckless thing hareton and i are friends now and i shall tell him all about you 
 the master seemed confounded a moment he grew pale and rose up eyeing her all the while with an expression of mortal hate 
 if you strike me hareton will strike you she said so you may as well sit down 
 if hareton does not turn you out of the room strike him to hell thundered heathcliff damnable witch dare you pretend to rouse him against me off with her do you hear fling her into the kitchen kill her ellen dean if you let her come into my sight again 
 hareton tried under his breath to persuade her to go 
 drag her away he cried savagely are you staying to talk and he approached to execute his own command 
 not obey you wicked man any more said catherine and soon detest you as much as i do 
 wisht wisht muttered the young man reproachfully i will not hear you speak so to him have done 
 but you let him strike me she cried come then he whispered earnestly it was too late heathcliff had caught hold of her 
 now you go he said to earnshaw accursed witch this time she has provoked me when i could not bear it and make her repent it for ever 
 he had his hand in her hair hareton attempted to release the locks entreating him not to hurt her that once black eyes flashed he seemed ready to tear catherine in pieces and i was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue when of a sudden his fingers relaxed he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm and gazed intently in her face then he drew his hand over his eyes stood a moment to collect himself apparently and turning anew to catherine said with assumed calmness you must learn to avoid putting me in a passion or i shall really murder you some time go with mrs dean and keep with her and confine your insolence to her ears as to hareton earnshaw if i see him listen to you send him seeking his bread where he can get it your love will make him an outcast and a beggar nelly take her and leave me all of you leave me 
 i led my young lady out she was too glad of her escape to resist the other followed and mr heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner i had counselled catherine to get hers upstairs but as soon as he perceived her vacant seat he sent me to call her he spoke to none of us ate very little and went out directly afterwards intimating that he should not return before evening 
 the two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence when i heard hareton sternly check his cousin on her offering a revelation of her conduct to his father he said he suffer a word to be uttered to him in his disparagement if he were the devil it signify he would stand by him and rather she would abuse himself as she used to than begin on mr heathcliff catherine was waxing cross at this but he found means to make her hold her tongue by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father and then she comprehended that earnshaw took the reputation home to himself and was attached by ties stronger than reason could forged by habit which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen she showed a good heart thenceforth in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning heathcliff and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and hareton indeed i believe she has ever breathed a syllable in the hearing against her oppressor since 
 when this slight disagreement was over they were thick again and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher i came in to sit with them after i had done my work and i felt so soothed and comforted to watch them that i did not notice how time got on you know they both appeared in a measure my children i had long been proud of one and now i was sure the other would be a source of equal satisfaction his honest warm and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred and sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry his brightening mind brightened his features and added spirit and nobility to their aspect i could hardly fancy it the same individual i had beheld on the day i discovered my little lady at wuthering heights after her expedition to the crags while i admired and they laboured dusk grew on and with it returned the master he came upon us quite unexpectedly entering by the front way and had a full view of the whole three ere we could raise our heads to glance at him well i reflected there was never a pleasanter or more harmless sight and it will be a burning shame to scold them the red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children he was and she eighteen each had so much of novelty to feel and learn that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity 
 they lifted their eyes together to encounter mr heathcliff perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar and they are those of catherine earnshaw the present catherine has no other likeness to her except a breadth of forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty whether she will or not with hareton the resemblance is carried further it is singular at all times then it was particularly striking because his senses were alert and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity i suppose this resemblance disarmed mr heathcliff he walked to the hearth in evident agitation but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man or i should say altered its character for it was there yet he took the book from his hand and glanced at the open page then returned it without any observation merely signing catherine away her companion lingered very little behind her and i was about to depart also but he bid me sit still 
 it is a poor conclusion is it not he observed having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed an absurd termination to my violent exertions i get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses and train myself to be capable of working like hercules and when everything is ready and in my power i find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished my old enemies have not beaten me now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives i could do it and none could hinder me but where is the use i care for striking i take the trouble to raise my hand that sounds as if i had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity it is far from being the case i have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction and i am too idle to destroy for nothing 
 nelly there is a strange change approaching in its shadow at present i take so little interest in my daily life that i hardly remember to eat and drink those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me and that appearance causes me pain amounting to agony about her i speak and i desire to think but i earnestly wish she were invisible her presence invokes only maddening sensations he moves me differently and yet if i could do it without seeming insane never see him again perhaps think me rather inclined to become so he added making an effort to smile if i try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies but not talk of what i tell you and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself it is tempting at last to turn it out to another 
 five minutes ago hareton seemed a personification of my youth not a human being i felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally in the first place his startling likeness to catherine connected him fearfully with her that however which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination is actually the least for what is not connected with her to me and what does not recall her i cannot look down to this floor but her features are shaped in the flags in every cloud in every the air at night and caught by glimpses in every object by am surrounded with her image the most ordinary faces of men and own me with a resemblance the entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist and that i have lost her well aspect was the ghost of my immortal love of my wild endeavours to hold my right my degradation my pride my happiness and my anguish 
 but it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you only it will let you know why with a reluctance to be always alone his society is no benefit rather an aggravation of the constant torment i suffer and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together i can give them no attention any more 
 but what do you mean by a change mr heathcliff i said alarmed at his manner though he was neither in danger of losing his senses nor dying according to my judgment he was quite strong and healthy and as to his reason from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things and entertaining odd fancies he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine 
 i shall not know that till it comes he said only half conscious of it now 
 you have no feelings of illness have you i asked 
 no nelly i have not he answered 
 then you are not afraid of death i pursued 
 afraid no he replied i have neither a fear nor a presentiment nor a hope of death why should i with my hard constitution and temperate mode of living and unperilous occupations i ought to and probably shall remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head and yet i cannot continue in this condition i have to remind myself to to remind my heart to beat and it is like bending back a stiff spring it is by compulsion that i do the slightest act not prompted by one thought and by compulsion that i notice anything alive or dead which is not associated with one universal idea i have a single wish and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it they have yearned towards it so long and so unwaveringly that convinced it will be it has devoured my existence i am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment my confessions have not relieved me but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which i show o god it is a long fight i wish it were over 
 he began to pace the room muttering terrible things to himself till i was inclined to believe as he said joseph did that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell i wondered greatly how it would end though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind even by looks it was his habitual mood i had no doubt he asserted it himself but not a soul from his general bearing would have conjectured the fact you did not when you saw him mr lockwood and at the period of which i speak he was just the same as then only fonder of continued solitude and perhaps still more laconic in company

 i led my young lady out she was too glad of her escape to resist the other followed and mr heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner i had counselled catherine to get hers upstairs but as soon as he perceived her vacant seat he sent me to call her he spoke to none of us ate very little and went out directly afterwards intimating that he should not return before evening 
 the two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence when i heard hareton sternly check his cousin on her offering a revelation of her conduct to his father he said he suffer a word to be uttered to him in his disparagement if he were the devil it signify he would stand by him and rather she would abuse himself as she used to than begin on mr heathcliff catherine was waxing cross at this but he found means to make her hold her tongue by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father and then she comprehended that earnshaw took the reputation home to himself and was attached by ties stronger than reason could forged by habit which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen she showed a good heart thenceforth in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning heathcliff and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and hareton indeed i believe she has ever breathed a syllable in the hearing against her oppressor since 
 when this slight disagreement was over they were thick again and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher i came in to sit with them after i had done my work and i felt so soothed and comforted to watch them that i did not notice how time got on you know they both appeared in a measure my children i had long been proud of one and now i was sure the other would be a source of equal satisfaction his honest warm and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred and sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry his brightening mind brightened his features and added spirit and nobility to their aspect i could hardly fancy it the same individual i had beheld on the day i discovered my little lady at wuthering heights after her expedition to the crags while i admired and they laboured dusk grew on and with it returned the master he came upon us quite unexpectedly entering by the front way and had a full view of the whole three ere we could raise our heads to glance at him well i reflected there was never a pleasanter or more harmless sight and it will be a burning shame to scold them the red firelight glowed on their two bonny heads and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children he was and she eighteen each had so much of novelty to feel and learn that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity 
 they lifted their eyes together to encounter mr heathcliff perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar and they are those of catherine earnshaw the present catherine has no other likeness to her except a breadth of forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty whether she will or not with hareton the resemblance is carried further it is singular at all times then it was particularly striking because his senses were alert and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity i suppose this resemblance disarmed mr heathcliff he walked to the hearth in evident agitation but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man or i should say altered its character for it was there yet he took the book from his hand and glanced at the open page then returned it without any observation merely signing catherine away her companion lingered very little behind her and i was about to depart also but he bid me sit still 
 it is a poor conclusion is it not he observed having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed an absurd termination to my violent exertions i get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses and train myself to be capable of working like hercules and when everything is ready and in my power i find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished my old enemies have not beaten me now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives i could do it and none could hinder me but where is the use i care for striking i take the trouble to raise my hand that sounds as if i had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity it is far from being the case i have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction and i am too idle to destroy for nothing 
 nelly there is a strange change approaching in its shadow at present i take so little interest in my daily life that i hardly remember to eat and drink those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me and that appearance causes me pain amounting to agony about her i speak and i desire to think but i earnestly wish she were invisible her presence invokes only maddening sensations he moves me differently and yet if i could do it without seeming insane never see him again perhaps think me rather inclined to become so he added making an effort to smile if i try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies but not talk of what i tell you and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself it is tempting at last to turn it out to another 
 five minutes ago hareton seemed a personification of my youth not a human being i felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally in the first place his startling likeness to catherine connected him fearfully with her that however which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination is actually the least for what is not connected with her to me and what does not recall her i cannot look down to this floor but her features are shaped in the flags in every cloud in every the air at night and caught by glimpses in every object by am surrounded with her image the most ordinary faces of men and own me with a resemblance the entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist and that i have lost her well aspect was the ghost of my immortal love of my wild endeavours to hold my right my degradation my pride my happiness and my anguish 
 but it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you only it will let you know why with a reluctance to be always alone his society is no benefit rather an aggravation of the constant torment i suffer and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together i can give them no attention any more 
 but what do you mean by a change mr heathcliff i said alarmed at his manner though he was neither in danger of losing his senses nor dying according to my judgment he was quite strong and healthy and as to his reason from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things and entertaining odd fancies he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine 
 i shall not know that till it comes he said only half conscious of it now 
 you have no feelings of illness have you i asked 
 no nelly i have not he answered 
 then you are not afraid of death i pursued 
 afraid no he replied i have neither a fear nor a presentiment nor a hope of death why should i with my hard constitution and temperate mode of living and unperilous occupations i ought to and probably shall remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head and yet i cannot continue in this condition i have to remind myself to to remind my heart to beat and it is like bending back a stiff spring it is by compulsion that i do the slightest act not prompted by one thought and by compulsion that i notice anything alive or dead which is not associated with one universal idea i have a single wish and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it they have yearned towards it so long and so unwaveringly that convinced it will be it has devoured my existence i am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment my confessions have not relieved me but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which i show o god it is a long fight i wish it were over 
 he began to pace the room muttering terrible things to himself till i was inclined to believe as he said joseph did that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell i wondered greatly how it would end though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind even by looks it was his habitual mood i had no doubt he asserted it himself but not a soul from his general bearing would have conjectured the fact you did not when you saw him mr lockwood and at the period of which i speak he was just the same as then only fonder of continued solitude and perhaps still more laconic in company

 new york november 
 dear marmee and beth 
 going to write you a regular volume for got heaps to tell though not a fine young lady traveling on the continent when i lost sight of dear old face i felt a trifle blue and might have shed a briny drop or two if an irish lady with four small children all crying more or less diverted my mind for i amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar 
 soon the sun came out and taking it as a good omen i cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart 
 mrs kirke welcomed me so kindly i felt at home at once even in that big house full of strangers she gave me a funny little sky she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so i can sit here and write whenever i like a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs and i took a fancy to my den on the spot the nursery where i am to teach and sew is a pleasant room next mrs private parlor and the two little girls are pretty children rather spoiled i fancy but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs and no doubt i shall make a model governess 
 i am to have my meals with the children if i prefer it to the great table and for the present i do for i am bashful though no one will believe it 
 now my dear make yourself at home said mrs k in her motherly way on the drive from morning to night as you may suppose with such a family but a great anxiety will be off my mind if i know the children are safe with you my rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as i can make it there are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable and your evenings are always free come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can the tea bell i must run and change my cap and off she bustled leaving me to settle myself in my new nest 
 as i went downstairs soon after i saw something i liked the flights are very long in this tall house and as i stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up i saw a gentleman come along behind her take theheavy hod of coal out of her hand carry it all the way up put it down at a door near by and walk away saying with a kind nod and a foreign accent it goes better so the little back is too young to haf such heaviness 
 it good of him i like such things for as father says trifles show character when i mentioned it to mrs k that evening she laughed and said that must have been professor bhaer always doing things of that sort 
 mrs k told me he was from berlin very learned and good but poor as a church mouse and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here according to the wishes of his sister who married an american not a very romantic story but it interested me and i was glad to hear that mrs k lends him her parlor for some of his scholars there is a glass door between it and the nursery and i mean to peep at him and then tell you how he looks almost forty so no harm marmee 
 after tea and a romp with the little girls i attacked the big workbasket and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend i shall keep a and send it once a week so goodnight and more tomorrow 
 
 tuesday eve 
 
 
 had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like sancho and at one time i really thought i should shake them all round some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and i kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still after luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and i went to my needlework like little mabel with a willing mind i was thanking my stars that learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlor door opened and shut and someone began to hum kennst du das land like a big bumblebee it was dreadfully improper i know but i resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door i peeped in professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him a regular stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes i ever saw and a splendid big voice that does ears good after our sharp or slipshod american gabble his clothes were rusty his hands were large and he a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet i liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe he looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone herein 
 i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on 
 me wants me bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him 
 thou shalt haf thy bhaer come then and take a goot hug from him my tina said the professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him 
 now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing so he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that i nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while mr bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more french than german 
 another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there i virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door one of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying now professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober 
 both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once i heard him say emphatically no no it is not so you haf not attend to what i say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation prut it all goes bad this day 
 poor man i pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away i fancy he has a hard life of it mrs kirke asked me if i go down to the five dinner and feeling a little bit homesick i thought i would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me so i made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind mrs kirke but as she is short and tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure she gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off i plucked up courage and looked about me the long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinner the gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done there was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics i think i shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her 
 cast away at the very bottom of the table was the professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a frenchman on the other if amy had been here have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship i mind for i like to see folks eat with a relish as hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day 
 as i went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror and i heard one say low to the other the new party 
 governess or something of that sort 
 what the deuce is she at our table for 
 friend of the old 
 handsome head but no style 
 not a bit of it give us a light and come on 
 i felt angry at first and then i care for a governess is as good as a clerk and got sense if i style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys i hate ordinary people 
 
 thursday 
 
 yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cozy with a light and fire i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here the little thing has lost her heart to mr bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore kitty and minnie kirk likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells the younger men quiz him it seems call him old fritz lager beer ursa major and make all manner of jokes on his name but he enjoys it like a boy mrs kirke says and takes it so that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways 
 the maiden lady is a miss norton rich cultivated and kind she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it the same sort that amy likes 
 i was in our parlor last evening when mr bhaer came in with some newspapers for mrs kirke she there but minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily this is friend miss march 
 yes and jolly and we like her lots added kitty who is and enfant terrible 
 we both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast 
 ah yes i hear these naughty ones go to vex you mees marsch if so again call at me and i come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches 
 i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella it flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other he seem at all ashamed of it for when i explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way 
 you haf a fine day to make your walk bon voyage mademoiselle 
 i laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes the german gentlemen embroider i know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty 
 nothing has happened to write about except a call on miss norton who has a room full of pretty things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if i would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escort if i enjoyed them she put it as a favor but sure mrs kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me as proud as lucifer but such favors from such people burden me and i accepted gratefully when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in and there was mr bhaer down on his hands and knees with tina on his back kitty leading him with a jump rope and minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs 
 we are playing nargerie explained kitty 
 dis is mine effalunt added tina holding on by the hair 
 mamma always allows us to do what we like saturday afternoon when franz and emil come she mr bhaer said minnie 
 the effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me i gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say hush to us and we go more softly 
 i promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did for a more glorious frolic i never witnessed they played tag and soldiers danced and sang and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops and the little koblods who ride the snowflakes as they fall i wish americans were as simple and natural as germans you 
 so fond of writing i should go spinning on forever if motives of economy stop me for though used thin paper and written fine i tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need pray forward as soon as you can spare them my small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them i know is teddy studying so hard that he find time to write to his friends take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone from your faithful jo 
 on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about bless you 
 
 december 
 
 my precious betsey 
 as this is to be a letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish they are not so interesting tome as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in the produces a constant state of effervescence saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun 
 we are very good friends now and begun to take lessons i really help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you to begin at the beginning mrs kirke called to me one day as i passed mr room where she was rummaging 
 did you ever see such a den my dear just come and help me put these books to rights for turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs i gave him not long ago 
 i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat and a box of white mice adorned the other boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room after a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found one over the bird cage one covered with ink and a third burned brown having been used as a holder 
 such a man laughed mrs k as she put the relics in the rag bay i suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kite tails dreadful but i scold him so and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod i agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and i forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes 
 let me mend them said i i mind it and he know like to so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books 
 so i have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socks for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns nothing was said and i hoped he find it out but one day last week he caught me at it hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to lear for tina runs in and out leaving the door open and i can hear i had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as i am the girl had gone and i thought he had also it was so still and i was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was mr bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to tina not to betray him 
 so he said as i stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me i peep at you and this is not bad but see i am not pleasanting when i say haf you a wish for german 
 yes but you are too busy i am too stupid to learn i blundered out as red as a peony 
 prut we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense at efening i shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you mees marsch i haf this debt to pay and he pointed to my work yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves ah but i haf an eye and i see much i haf a heart and i feel thanks for this come a little lesson then and now or no more good fairy works for me and mine 
 of course i say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began i took four lessons and then i stuck fast in a grammatical bog the professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a with me whether to laugh or cry i tried both ways and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if covered myself in glory 
 now we shall try a new way you and i will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble 
 he spoke so kindly and opened hans fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a style that seemed to amuse him immensely i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gut now we go well my turn i do him in german gif me your ear and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laugh and i did though i understand half he read for i help it he was so earnest i so excited and the whole thing so comical 
 after that we got on better and now i read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and i can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly i like it very much and he seem tired of it yet which is very good of him it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money tell me something nice marmee 
 glad laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow you see beth manages him better than i did not jealous dear do your best only make a saint of him afraid i like him without a spice of human naughtiness read him bits of my letters i time to write much and that will do just as well thank heaven beth continues so comfortable 
 
 
 january 
 
 
 a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for had a kind of feeling that you forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought new ink bib was capital and box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps 
 speaking of books reminds me that getting rich in that line for on new day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer 
 you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen 
 i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now laugh at his horrid name it pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer 
 not having much money or knowing what like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that 
 they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new eve i mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism 
 i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo

 had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like sancho and at one time i really thought i should shake them all round some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and i kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still after luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and i went to my needlework like little mabel with a willing mind i was thanking my stars that learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlor door opened and shut and someone began to hum kennst du das land like a big bumblebee it was dreadfully improper i know but i resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door i peeped in professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him a regular stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes i ever saw and a splendid big voice that does ears good after our sharp or slipshod american gabble his clothes were rusty his hands were large and he a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet i liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe he looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone herein 
 i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on 
 me wants me bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him 
 thou shalt haf thy bhaer come then and take a goot hug from him my tina said the professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him 
 now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing so he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that i nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while mr bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more french than german 
 another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there i virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door one of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying now professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober 
 both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once i heard him say emphatically no no it is not so you haf not attend to what i say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation prut it all goes bad this day 
 poor man i pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away i fancy he has a hard life of it mrs kirke asked me if i go down to the five dinner and feeling a little bit homesick i thought i would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me so i made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind mrs kirke but as she is short and tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure she gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off i plucked up courage and looked about me the long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinner the gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done there was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics i think i shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her 
 cast away at the very bottom of the table was the professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a frenchman on the other if amy had been here have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship i mind for i like to see folks eat with a relish as hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day 
 as i went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror and i heard one say low to the other the new party 
 governess or something of that sort 
 what the deuce is she at our table for 
 friend of the old 
 handsome head but no style 
 not a bit of it give us a light and come on 
 i felt angry at first and then i care for a governess is as good as a clerk and got sense if i style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys i hate ordinary people 
 
 thursday 
 
 yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cozy with a light and fire i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here the little thing has lost her heart to mr bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore kitty and minnie kirk likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells the younger men quiz him it seems call him old fritz lager beer ursa major and make all manner of jokes on his name but he enjoys it like a boy mrs kirke says and takes it so that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways 
 the maiden lady is a miss norton rich cultivated and kind she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it the same sort that amy likes 
 i was in our parlor last evening when mr bhaer came in with some newspapers for mrs kirke she there but minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily this is friend miss march 
 yes and jolly and we like her lots added kitty who is and enfant terrible 
 we both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast 
 ah yes i hear these naughty ones go to vex you mees marsch if so again call at me and i come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches 
 i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella it flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other he seem at all ashamed of it for when i explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way 
 you haf a fine day to make your walk bon voyage mademoiselle 
 i laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes the german gentlemen embroider i know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty 
 nothing has happened to write about except a call on miss norton who has a room full of pretty things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if i would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escort if i enjoyed them she put it as a favor but sure mrs kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me as proud as lucifer but such favors from such people burden me and i accepted gratefully when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in and there was mr bhaer down on his hands and knees with tina on his back kitty leading him with a jump rope and minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs 
 we are playing nargerie explained kitty 
 dis is mine effalunt added tina holding on by the hair 
 mamma always allows us to do what we like saturday afternoon when franz and emil come she mr bhaer said minnie 
 the effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me i gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say hush to us and we go more softly 
 i promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did for a more glorious frolic i never witnessed they played tag and soldiers danced and sang and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops and the little koblods who ride the snowflakes as they fall i wish americans were as simple and natural as germans you 
 so fond of writing i should go spinning on forever if motives of economy stop me for though used thin paper and written fine i tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need pray forward as soon as you can spare them my small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them i know is teddy studying so hard that he find time to write to his friends take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone from your faithful jo 
 on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about bless you 
 
 december 
 
 my precious betsey 
 as this is to be a letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish they are not so interesting tome as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in the produces a constant state of effervescence saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun 
 we are very good friends now and begun to take lessons i really help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you to begin at the beginning mrs kirke called to me one day as i passed mr room where she was rummaging 
 did you ever see such a den my dear just come and help me put these books to rights for turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs i gave him not long ago 
 i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat and a box of white mice adorned the other boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room after a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found one over the bird cage one covered with ink and a third burned brown having been used as a holder 
 such a man laughed mrs k as she put the relics in the rag bay i suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kite tails dreadful but i scold him so and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod i agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and i forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes 
 let me mend them said i i mind it and he know like to so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books 
 so i have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socks for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns nothing was said and i hoped he find it out but one day last week he caught me at it hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to lear for tina runs in and out leaving the door open and i can hear i had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as i am the girl had gone and i thought he had also it was so still and i was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was mr bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to tina not to betray him 
 so he said as i stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me i peep at you and this is not bad but see i am not pleasanting when i say haf you a wish for german 
 yes but you are too busy i am too stupid to learn i blundered out as red as a peony 
 prut we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense at efening i shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you mees marsch i haf this debt to pay and he pointed to my work yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves ah but i haf an eye and i see much i haf a heart and i feel thanks for this come a little lesson then and now or no more good fairy works for me and mine 
 of course i say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began i took four lessons and then i stuck fast in a grammatical bog the professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a with me whether to laugh or cry i tried both ways and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if covered myself in glory 
 now we shall try a new way you and i will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble 
 he spoke so kindly and opened hans fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a style that seemed to amuse him immensely i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gut now we go well my turn i do him in german gif me your ear and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laugh and i did though i understand half he read for i help it he was so earnest i so excited and the whole thing so comical 
 after that we got on better and now i read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and i can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly i like it very much and he seem tired of it yet which is very good of him it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money tell me something nice marmee 
 glad laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow you see beth manages him better than i did not jealous dear do your best only make a saint of him afraid i like him without a spice of human naughtiness read him bits of my letters i time to write much and that will do just as well thank heaven beth continues so comfortable 
 
 
 january 
 
 
 a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for had a kind of feeling that you forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought new ink bib was capital and box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps 
 speaking of books reminds me that getting rich in that line for on new day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer 
 you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen 
 i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now laugh at his horrid name it pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer 
 not having much money or knowing what like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that 
 they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new eve i mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titania a perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism 
 i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo

lionfish nov chapter the death eaterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 voldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own body his hands were like large pale spiders his long white fingers caressed his own chest his arms his face the red eyes whose pupils were slits like a cats gleamed still more brightly through the darkness he held up his hands and flexed the fingers his expression rapt and exultant he took not the slightest notice of wormtail who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground nor of the great snake which had slithered back into sight and was circling harry again hissing voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand he caressed it gently too and then he raised it and pointed it at wormtail who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where harry was tied he fell to the foot of it and lay there crumpled up and crying voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon harry laughing a high cold mirthless laugh 
 
 robes were shining with blood now he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them 
 
 my lord he choked my lordyou promisedyou did promise 
 
 hold out your arm said voldemort lazily 
 
 oh masterthank you master 
 
 he extended the bleeding stump but voldemort laughed again 
 
 the other arm wormtail 
 
 master pleaseplease 
 
 voldemort bent down and pulled out left arm he forced the sleeve of robes up past his elbow and harry saw something upon the skin there something like a vivid red tattoo a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth the image that had appeared in the sky at the quidditch world cup the dark mark voldemort examined it carefully ignoring uncontrollable weeping 
 
 it is back he said softly they will all have noticed itand now we shall seenow we shall know 
 
 he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on arm 
 
 the scar on forehead seared with a sharp pain again and wormtail let out a fresh howl voldemort removed his fingers from mark and harry saw that it had turned jet black 
 
 a look of cruel satisfaction on his face voldemort straightened up threw back his head and stared around at the dark graveyard 
 
 how many will be brave enough to return when they feel it he whispered his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars and how many will be foolish enough to stay away 
 
 he began to pace up and down before harry and wormtail eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while after a minute or so he looked down at harry again a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face 
 
 you stand harry potter upon the remains of my late father he hissed softly a muggle and a foolvery like your dear mother but they both had their uses did they not your mother died to defend you as a childand i killed my father and see how useful he has proved himself in death 
 
 voldemort laughed again up and down he paced looking all around him as he walked and the snake continued to circle in the grass 
 
 you see that house upon the hillside potter my father lived there my mother a witch who lived here in this village fell in love with him but he abandoned her when she told him what she like magic my father 
 
 he left her and returned to his muggle parents before i was even born potter and she died giving birth to me leaving me to be raised in a muggle orphanagebut i vowed to find himi revenged myself upon him that fool who gave me his nametom riddle 
 
 still he paced his red eyes darting from grave to grave 
 
 listen to me reliving family history he said quietly why i am growing quite look harry my true family returns 
 
 the air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks between graves behind the yew tree in every shadowy space wizards were apparating all of them were hooded and masked and one by one they moved forwardslowly cautiously as though they could hardly believe their eyes voldemort stood in silence waiting for them then one of the death eaters fell to his knees crawled toward voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes 
 
 mastermaster he murmured 
 
 the death eaters behind him did the same each of them approaching voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes before backing away and standing up forming a silent circle which enclosed tom grave harry voldemort and the sobbing and twitching heap that was wormtail yet they left gaps in the circle as though waiting for more people voldemort however did not seem to expect more he looked around at the hooded faces and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle as though it had shivered 
 
 welcome death eaters said voldemort quietly thirteen yearsthirteen years since last we met yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday we are still united under the dark mark then or are we 
 
 he put back his terrible face and sniffed his nostrils widening 
 
 i smell guilt he said there is a stench or guilt upon the air 
 
 a second shiver ran around the circle as though each member of it longed but did not dare to step back from him 
 
 i see you all whole and healthy with your powers intact such prompt appearances and i ask myselfwhy did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master to whom they swore eternal loyalty 
 
 no one spoke no one moved except wormtail who was upon the ground still sobbing over his bleeding arm 
 
 and i answer myself whispered voldemort they must have believed me broken they thought i was gone they slipped back among my enemies and they pleaded innocence and ignorance and bewitchment 
 
 and then i ask myself but how could they have believed i would not rise again they who knew the steps i took long ago to guard myself against mortal death they who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when i was mightier than any wizard living 
 
 and i answer myself perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist one that could vanquish even lord voldemortperhaps they now pay allegiance to anotherperhaps that champion of commoners of mudbloods and muggles albus dumbledore 
 
 at the mention of name the members of the circle stirred and some muttered and shook their heads voldemort ignored them 
 
 it is a disappointment to mei confess myself disappointed 
 
 one of the men suddenly flung himself forward breaking the circle trembling from head to foot he collapsed at feet 
 
 master he shrieked master forgive me forgive us all 
 
 voldemort began to laugh he raised his wand 
 
 crucio 
 
 the death eater on the ground writhed and shrieked harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses the police come he thought desperatelyanyoneanything 
 
 voldemort raised his wand the tortured death eater lay flat upon the ground gasping 
 
 get up avery said voldemort softly stand up you ask for forgiveness i do not forgive i do not forget thirteen long yearsi want thirteen years repayment before i forgive you wormtail here has paid some of his debt already have you not wormtail 
 
 he looked down at wormtail who continued to sob 
 
 you returned to me not out of loyalty but out of fear of your old friends you deserve this pain wormtail you know that you 
 
 yes master moaned wormtail please masterplease 
 
 yet you helped return me to my body said voldemort coolly watching wormtail sob on the ground worthless and traitorous as you are you helped meand lord voldemort rewards his helpers 
 
 voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air a streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wake momentarily shapeless it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand bright as moonlight which soared downward and fixed itself upon bleeding wrist 
 
 sobbing stopped abruptly his breathing harsh and ragged he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand now attached seamlessly to his arm as though he were wearing a dazzling glove he flexed the shining fingers then trembling picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder 
 
 my lord he whispered masterit is beautifulthank youthank you 
 
 he scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of robes 
 
 may your loyalty never waver again wormtail said voldemort 
 
 no my lordnever my lord 
 
 wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle staring at his powerful new hand his face still shining with tears voldemort now approached the man on right 
 
 lucius my slippery friend he whispered halting before him i am told that you have not renounced the old ways though to the world you present a respectable face you are still ready to take the lead in a spot of i believe yet you never tried to find me exploits at the quidditch world cup were fun i daresaybut might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master 
 
 my lord i was constantly on the alert came lucius voice swiftly from beneath the hood had there been any sign from you any whisper of your whereabouts i would have been at your side immediately nothing could have prevented me 
 
 and yet you ran from my mark when a faithful death eater sent it into the sky last summer said voldemort lazily and mr malfoy stopped talking abruptly yes i know all about that have disappointed expect more faithful service in the future 
 
 of course my lord of are merciful thank you 
 
 voldemort moved on and stopped staring at the space large enough for two people that separated malfoy and the next man 
 
 the lestranges should stand here said voldemort quietly but they are entombed in azkaban they were faithful they went to azkaban rather than renounce azkaban is broken open the lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams the dementors will join usthey are our natural allieswe will recall the banished giantsi shall have all my devoted servants returned to me and an army of creatures whom all fear 
 
 he walked on some of the death eaters he passed in silence but he paused before others and spoke to them 
 
 macnairdestroying dangerous beasts for the ministry of magic now wormtail tells me you shall have better victims than that soon macnair lord voldemort will provide 
 
 thank you masterthank you murmured macnair 
 
 and here voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures we have crabbeyou will do better this time will you not crabbe and you goyle 
 
 they bowed clumsily muttering dully 
 
 yes master 
 
 we will master 
 
 the same goes for you nott said voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in mr goyles shadow 
 
 my lord i prostrate myself before you i am your most faithful 
 
 that will do said voldemort 
 
 he had reached the largest gap of all and he stood surveying it with his blank red eyes as though he could see people standing there 
 
 and here we have six missing death eatersthree dead in my service one too cowardly to returnhe will pay one who i believe has left me foreverhe will be killed of courseand one who remains my most faithful servant and who has already reentered my service 
 
 the death eaters stirred and harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks 
 
 he is at hogwarts that faithful servant and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight 
 
 yes said voldemort a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in direction harry potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party one might go so far as to call him my guest of honor 
 
 there was a silence then the death eater to the right of wormtail stepped forward and lucius voice spoke from under the mask 
 
 master we crave to knowwe beg you to tell ushow you have achieved thisthis miraclehow you managed to return to us 
 
 ah what a story it is lucius said voldemort and it begins and ends with my young friend here 
 
 he walked lazily over to stand next to harry so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them the snake continued to circle 
 
 you know of course that they have called this boy my downfall voldemort said softly his red eyes upon harry whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body i tried to kill him his mother died in the attempt to save him and unwittingly provided him with a protection i admit i had not could not touch the boy 
 
 voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to cheek 
 
 his mother left upon him the traces other is old magic i should have remembered it i was foolish to overlook itbut no matter i can touch him now 
 
 harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him and thought his head would burst with the pain voldemort laughed softly in his ear then took the finger away and continued addressing the death eaters 
 
 i miscalculated my friends i admit it my curse was deflected by the foolish sacrifice and it rebounded upon myself aaahpain beyond pain my friends nothing could have prepared me for it i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghostbut still i was alive what i was even i do not knowi who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality you know my goal to conquer death and now i was tested and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had workedfor i had not been killed though the curse should have done it nevertheless i was as powerless as the weakest creature alive and without the means to help myselffor i had no body and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand 
 
 i remember only forcing myself sleeplessly endlessly second by second to settled in a faraway place in a forest and i one of my faithful death eaters would try and find meone of them would come and perform the magic i could not to restore me to a body but i waited in vain 
 
 the shiver ran once more around the circle of listening death eaters voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing 
 
 only one power remained to me i could possess the bodies of others but i dared not go where other humans were plentiful for i knew that the aurors were still abroad and searching for me 
 
 i sometimes inhabited animals snakes of course being my preference but i was little better off inside them than as pure spirit for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magicand my possession of them shortened their lives none of them lasted long 
 
 thenfour years agothe means for my return seemed assured a wizard young foolish and gullible wandered across my path in the forest i had made my home oh he seemed the very chance i had been dreaming offor he was a teacher at schoolhe was easy to bend to my willhe brought me back to this country and after a while i took possession of his body to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders but my plan failed i did not manage to steal the stone i was not to be assured immortal life i was thwartedthwarted once again by harry potter 
 
 silence once more nothing was stirring not even the leaves on the yew tree the death eaters were quite motionless the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon voldemort and upon harry 
 
 the servant died when i left his body and i was left as weak as ever i had been voldemort continued i returned to my hiding place far away and i will not pretend to you that i then fear that i might never regain my that was perhaps my darkest houri could not hope that i would be sent another wizard to possessand i had given up hope now that any of my death eaters cared what had become of me 
 
 one or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably but voldemort took no notice 
 
 and then not even a year ago when i had almost abandoned hope it happened at lasta servant returned to me wormtail here who had faked his own death to escape justice was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends and decided to return to his master he sought me in the country where it had long been rumored i was hidinghelped of course by the rats he met along the way wormtail has a curious affinity with rats do you not wormtail his filthy little friends told him there was a place deep in an albanian forest that they avoided where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them 
 
 but his journey back to me was not smooth was it wormtail for hungry one night on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me he foolishly stopped at an inn for some foodand who should he meet there but one bertha jorkins a witch from the ministry of magic 
 
 now see the way that fate favors lord voldemort this might have been the end of wormtail and of my last hope for regeneration but wormtail displaying a presence of mind i would never have expected from him convinced bertha jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll he overpowered herhe brought her to me and bertha jorkins who might have ruined all proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreamsfor with a little persuasion she became a veritable mine of information 
 
 she told me that the triwizard tournament would be played at hogwarts this year she told me that she knew of a faithful death eater who would be only too willing to help me if i could only contact him she told me many thingsbut the means i used to break the memory charm upon her were powerful and when i had extracted all useful information from her her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair she had now served her purpose i could not possess her i disposed of her 
 
 voldemort smiled his terrible smile his red eyes blank and pitiless 
 
 body of course was ill adapted for possession as all assumed him dead and would attract far too much attention if noticed however he was the servant i needed and poor wizard though he is wormtail was able to follow the instructions i gave him which would return me to a rudimentary weak body of my own a body i would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirtha spell or two of my own inventiona little help from my dear nagini red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake a potion concocted from unicorn blood and the snake venom nagini providedi was soon returned to an almost human form and strong enough to travel 
 
 there was no hope of stealing the stone anymore for i knew that dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed but i was willing to embrace mortal life again before chasing immortality i set my sights loweri would settle for my old body back again and my old strength 
 
 i knew that to achieve this it is an old piece of dark magic the potion that revived me tonight i would need three powerful ingredients well one of them was already at hand was it not wormtail flesh given by a servant 
 
 my bone naturally meant that we would have to come here where he was buried but the blood of a foewormtail would have had me use any wizard would you not wormtail any wizard who had hated meas so many of them still do but i knew the one i must use if i was to rise again more powerful than i had been when i had fallen i wanted harry potters blood i wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years agofor the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too 
 
 but how to get at harry potter for he has been better protected than i think even he knows protected in ways devised by dumbledore long ago when it fell to him to arrange the future dumbledore invoked an ancient magic to ensure the protection as long as he is in his relations care not even i can touch him of course there was the quidditch world thought his protection might be weaker there away from his relations and dumbledore but i was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of ministry wizards and then the boy would return to hogwarts where he is under the crooked nose of that fool from morning until night so how could i take him 
 
 whyby using bertha information of course use my one faithful death eater stationed at hogwarts to ensure that the name was entered into the goblet of fire use my death eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament that he touched the triwizard cup first the cup which my death eater had turned into a portkey which would bring him here beyond the reach of help and protection and into my waiting arms and here he isthe boy you all believed had been my downfall 
 
 voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face harry he raised his wand 
 
 crucio 
 
 it was pain beyond anything harry had ever experienced his very bones were on fire his head was surely splitting along his scar his eyes were rolling madly in his head he wanted it to endto black outto die 
 
 and then it was gone he was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of father looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist the night was ringing with the sound of the death eaters laughter 
 
 you see i think how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me said voldemort but i want there to be no mistake in mind harry potter escaped me by a lucky chance and i am now going to prove my power by killing him here and now in front of you all when there is no dumbledore to help him and no mother to die for him i will give him his chance he will be allowed to fight and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger just a little longer nagini he whispered and the snake glided away through the grass to where the death eaters stood watching 
 
 now untie him wormtail and give him back his wand 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the death eaterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 voldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own body his hands were like large pale spiders his long white fingers caressed his own chest his arms his face the red eyes whose pupils were slits like a cats gleamed still more brightly through the darkness he held up his hands and flexed the fingers his expression rapt and exultant he took not the slightest notice of wormtail who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground nor of the great snake which had slithered back into sight and was circling harry again hissing voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand he caressed it gently too and then he raised it and pointed it at wormtail who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where harry was tied he fell to the foot of it and lay there crumpled up and crying voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon harry laughing a high cold mirthless laugh 
 
 robes were shining with blood now he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them 
 
 my lord he choked my lordyou promisedyou did promise 
 
 hold out your arm said voldemort lazily 
 
 oh masterthank you master 
 
 he extended the bleeding stump but voldemort laughed again 
 
 the other arm wormtail 
 
 master pleaseplease 
 
 voldemort bent down and pulled out left arm he forced the sleeve of robes up past his elbow and harry saw something upon the skin there something like a vivid red tattoo a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth the image that had appeared in the sky at the quidditch world cup the dark mark voldemort examined it carefully ignoring uncontrollable weeping 
 
 it is back he said softly they will all have noticed itand now we shall seenow we shall know 
 
 he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on arm 
 
 the scar on forehead seared with a sharp pain again and wormtail let out a fresh howl voldemort removed his fingers from mark and harry saw that it had turned jet black 
 
 a look of cruel satisfaction on his face voldemort straightened up threw back his head and stared around at the dark graveyard 
 
 how many will be brave enough to return when they feel it he whispered his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars and how many will be foolish enough to stay away 
 
 he began to pace up and down before harry and wormtail eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while after a minute or so he looked down at harry again a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face 
 
 you stand harry potter upon the remains of my late father he hissed softly a muggle and a foolvery like your dear mother but they both had their uses did they not your mother died to defend you as a childand i killed my father and see how useful he has proved himself in death 
 
 voldemort laughed again up and down he paced looking all around him as he walked and the snake continued to circle in the grass 
 
 you see that house upon the hillside potter my father lived there my mother a witch who lived here in this village fell in love with him but he abandoned her when she told him what she like magic my father 
 
 he left her and returned to his muggle parents before i was even born potter and she died giving birth to me leaving me to be raised in a muggle orphanagebut i vowed to find himi revenged myself upon him that fool who gave me his nametom riddle 
 
 still he paced his red eyes darting from grave to grave 
 
 listen to me reliving family history he said quietly why i am growing quite look harry my true family returns 
 
 the air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks between graves behind the yew tree in every shadowy space wizards were apparating all of them were hooded and masked and one by one they moved forwardslowly cautiously as though they could hardly believe their eyes voldemort stood in silence waiting for them then one of the death eaters fell to his knees crawled toward voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes 
 
 mastermaster he murmured 
 
 the death eaters behind him did the same each of them approaching voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes before backing away and standing up forming a silent circle which enclosed tom grave harry voldemort and the sobbing and twitching heap that was wormtail yet they left gaps in the circle as though waiting for more people voldemort however did not seem to expect more he looked around at the hooded faces and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle as though it had shivered 
 
 welcome death eaters said voldemort quietly thirteen yearsthirteen years since last we met yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday we are still united under the dark mark then or are we 
 
 he put back his terrible face and sniffed his nostrils widening 
 
 i smell guilt he said there is a stench or guilt upon the air 
 
 a second shiver ran around the circle as though each member of it longed but did not dare to step back from him 
 
 i see you all whole and healthy with your powers intact such prompt appearances and i ask myselfwhy did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master to whom they swore eternal loyalty 
 
 no one spoke no one moved except wormtail who was upon the ground still sobbing over his bleeding arm 
 
 and i answer myself whispered voldemort they must have believed me broken they thought i was gone they slipped back among my enemies and they pleaded innocence and ignorance and bewitchment 
 
 and then i ask myself but how could they have believed i would not rise again they who knew the steps i took long ago to guard myself against mortal death they who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when i was mightier than any wizard living 
 
 and i answer myself perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist one that could vanquish even lord voldemortperhaps they now pay allegiance to anotherperhaps that champion of commoners of mudbloods and muggles albus dumbledore 
 
 at the mention of name the members of the circle stirred and some muttered and shook their heads voldemort ignored them 
 
 it is a disappointment to mei confess myself disappointed 
 
 one of the men suddenly flung himself forward breaking the circle trembling from head to foot he collapsed at feet 
 
 master he shrieked master forgive me forgive us all 
 
 voldemort began to laugh he raised his wand 
 
 crucio 
 
 the death eater on the ground writhed and shrieked harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses the police come he thought desperatelyanyoneanything 
 
 voldemort raised his wand the tortured death eater lay flat upon the ground gasping 
 
 get up avery said voldemort softly stand up you ask for forgiveness i do not forgive i do not forget thirteen long yearsi want thirteen years repayment before i forgive you wormtail here has paid some of his debt already have you not wormtail 
 
 he looked down at wormtail who continued to sob 
 
 you returned to me not out of loyalty but out of fear of your old friends you deserve this pain wormtail you know that you 
 
 yes master moaned wormtail please masterplease 
 
 yet you helped return me to my body said voldemort coolly watching wormtail sob on the ground worthless and traitorous as you are you helped meand lord voldemort rewards his helpers 
 
 voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air a streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wake momentarily shapeless it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand bright as moonlight which soared downward and fixed itself upon bleeding wrist 
 
 sobbing stopped abruptly his breathing harsh and ragged he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand now attached seamlessly to his arm as though he were wearing a dazzling glove he flexed the shining fingers then trembling picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder 
 
 my lord he whispered masterit is beautifulthank youthank you 
 
 he scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of robes 
 
 may your loyalty never waver again wormtail said voldemort 
 
 no my lordnever my lord 
 
 wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle staring at his powerful new hand his face still shining with tears voldemort now approached the man on right 
 
 lucius my slippery friend he whispered halting before him i am told that you have not renounced the old ways though to the world you present a respectable face you are still ready to take the lead in a spot of i believe yet you never tried to find me exploits at the quidditch world cup were fun i daresaybut might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master 
 
 my lord i was constantly on the alert came lucius voice swiftly from beneath the hood had there been any sign from you any whisper of your whereabouts i would have been at your side immediately nothing could have prevented me 
 
 and yet you ran from my mark when a faithful death eater sent it into the sky last summer said voldemort lazily and mr malfoy stopped talking abruptly yes i know all about that have disappointed expect more faithful service in the future 
 
 of course my lord of are merciful thank you 
 
 voldemort moved on and stopped staring at the space large enough for two people that separated malfoy and the next man 
 
 the lestranges should stand here said voldemort quietly but they are entombed in azkaban they were faithful they went to azkaban rather than renounce azkaban is broken open the lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams the dementors will join usthey are our natural allieswe will recall the banished giantsi shall have all my devoted servants returned to me and an army of creatures whom all fear 
 
 he walked on some of the death eaters he passed in silence but he paused before others and spoke to them 
 
 macnairdestroying dangerous beasts for the ministry of magic now wormtail tells me you shall have better victims than that soon macnair lord voldemort will provide 
 
 thank you masterthank you murmured macnair 
 
 and here voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures we have crabbeyou will do better this time will you not crabbe and you goyle 
 
 they bowed clumsily muttering dully 
 
 yes master 
 
 we will master 
 
 the same goes for you nott said voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in mr goyles shadow 
 
 my lord i prostrate myself before you i am your most faithful 
 
 that will do said voldemort 
 
 he had reached the largest gap of all and he stood surveying it with his blank red eyes as though he could see people standing there 
 
 and here we have six missing death eatersthree dead in my service one too cowardly to returnhe will pay one who i believe has left me foreverhe will be killed of courseand one who remains my most faithful servant and who has already reentered my service 
 
 the death eaters stirred and harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks 
 
 he is at hogwarts that faithful servant and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight 
 
 yes said voldemort a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in direction harry potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party one might go so far as to call him my guest of honor 
 
 there was a silence then the death eater to the right of wormtail stepped forward and lucius voice spoke from under the mask 
 
 master we crave to knowwe beg you to tell ushow you have achieved thisthis miraclehow you managed to return to us 
 
 ah what a story it is lucius said voldemort and it begins and ends with my young friend here 
 
 he walked lazily over to stand next to harry so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them the snake continued to circle 
 
 you know of course that they have called this boy my downfall voldemort said softly his red eyes upon harry whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body i tried to kill him his mother died in the attempt to save him and unwittingly provided him with a protection i admit i had not could not touch the boy 
 
 voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to cheek 
 
 his mother left upon him the traces other is old magic i should have remembered it i was foolish to overlook itbut no matter i can touch him now 
 
 harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him and thought his head would burst with the pain voldemort laughed softly in his ear then took the finger away and continued addressing the death eaters 
 
 i miscalculated my friends i admit it my curse was deflected by the foolish sacrifice and it rebounded upon myself aaahpain beyond pain my friends nothing could have prepared me for it i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghostbut still i was alive what i was even i do not knowi who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality you know my goal to conquer death and now i was tested and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had workedfor i had not been killed though the curse should have done it nevertheless i was as powerless as the weakest creature alive and without the means to help myselffor i had no body and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand 
 
 i remember only forcing myself sleeplessly endlessly second by second to settled in a faraway place in a forest and i one of my faithful death eaters would try and find meone of them would come and perform the magic i could not to restore me to a body but i waited in vain 
 
 the shiver ran once more around the circle of listening death eaters voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing 
 
 only one power remained to me i could possess the bodies of others but i dared not go where other humans were plentiful for i knew that the aurors were still abroad and searching for me 
 
 i sometimes inhabited animals snakes of course being my preference but i was little better off inside them than as pure spirit for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magicand my possession of them shortened their lives none of them lasted long 
 
 thenfour years agothe means for my return seemed assured a wizard young foolish and gullible wandered across my path in the forest i had made my home oh he seemed the very chance i had been dreaming offor he was a teacher at schoolhe was easy to bend to my willhe brought me back to this country and after a while i took possession of his body to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders but my plan failed i did not manage to steal the stone i was not to be assured immortal life i was thwartedthwarted once again by harry potter 
 
 silence once more nothing was stirring not even the leaves on the yew tree the death eaters were quite motionless the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon voldemort and upon harry 
 
 the servant died when i left his body and i was left as weak as ever i had been voldemort continued i returned to my hiding place far away and i will not pretend to you that i then fear that i might never regain my that was perhaps my darkest houri could not hope that i would be sent another wizard to possessand i had given up hope now that any of my death eaters cared what had become of me 
 
 one or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably but voldemort took no notice

 but his journey back to me was not smooth was it wormtail for hungry one night on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me he foolishly stopped at an inn for some foodand who should he meet there but one bertha jorkins a witch from the ministry of magic 
 
 now see the way that fate favors lord voldemort this might have been the end of wormtail and of my last hope for regeneration but wormtail displaying a presence of mind i would never have expected from him convinced bertha jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll he overpowered herhe brought her to me and bertha jorkins who might have ruined all proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreamsfor with a little persuasion she became a veritable mine of information

 now untie him wormtail and give him back his wand

lionfish nov chapter fight and flightcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had no idea what hermione was planning or even whether she had a plan he walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside office knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going he did not dare attempt to talk to her umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing 
 
 hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall the din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the great hallit seemed incredible to harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner celebrating the end of exams not a care in the world 
 
 hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air the sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest now and as hermione marched purposefully across the grassumbridge jogging to keep uptheir long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks 
 
 hidden in hut is it said umbridge eagerly in ear 
 
 of course not said hermione scathingly hagrid might have set it off accidentally 
 
 yes said umbridge whose excitement seemed to be mounting yes he would have done of course the great oaf 
 
 she laughed harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat but resisted his scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned as he knew it would if voldemort had moved in for the kill 
 
 th en where is it asked umbridge with a hint or uncertainty in her voice as hermione continued to stride towards the forest 
 
 in there of course said hermione pointing into the dark trees it had to be somewhere that students going to find it accidentally it 
 
 of course said umbridge though she sounded a little apprehensive now of course very well then you two stay ahead of me 
 
 can we have your wand then if going first harry asked her 
 
 no i think so mr potter said umbridge sweetly poking him in the back with it the ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours afraid 
 
 as they reached the cool shade of the first trees harry tried to catch eye walking into the forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening she however merely gave umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees moving at such a pace that umbridge with her shorter legs had difficulty in keeping up 
 
 is it very far in umbridge asked as her robe ripped on a bramble 
 
 oh yes said hermione yes well hidden 
 
 misgivings increased hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit grawp but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster aragog hermione had not been with him on that occasion he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it 
 
 erare you sure this is the right way he asked her pointedly 
 
 oh yes she said in a steely voice crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise behind them umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling neither of them paused to help her up again hermione merely strode on calling loudly over her shoulder a bit further in 
 
 hermione keep your voice down harry muttered hurrying to catch up with her anything could be listening in here 
 
 i want us heard she answered quietly as umbridge jogged noisily after them see 
 
 they walked on for what seemed a long time until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest one of being watched by unseen eyes 
 
 how much further demanded umbridge angrily from behind him 
 
 not far now shouted hermione as they emerged into a dim dank clearing just a little bit 
 
 an arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head the air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves harry could feel the forest floor trembling umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield 
 
 he wrenched himself free of her and turned around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side their bows raised and loaded pointing at harry hermione and umbridge they backed slowly into the centre of the clearing umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror harry looked sideways at hermione she was wearing a triumphant smile 
 
 who are you said a voice 
 
 harry looked left the centaur called magorian was walking towards them out of the circle his bow like those of the others was raised on right umbridge was still whimpering her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur 
 
 i asked you who are you human said magorian roughly 
 
 i am dolores umbridge said umbridge in a terrified voice senior undersecretary to the minister for magic and headmistress and high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 you are from the ministry of magic said magorian as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly 
 
 right said umbridge in an even higher voice so be very careful by the laws laid down by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures any attack by such as yourselves on a human 
 
 what did you call us shouted a black centaur whom harry recognised as bane there was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them 
 
 call them that hermione said furiously but umbridge did not appear to have heard her still pointing her shaking wand at magorian she continued law fifteen b states clearly that any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have intelligence and therefore considered responsible for its actions 
 
 intelligence repeated magorian as bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground we consider that a great insult human our intelligence thankfully far outstrips your own 
 
 what are you doing in our forest bellowed the grey centaur harry and hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest why are you here 
 
 your forest said umbridge shaking now not only with fright but also it seemed with indignation i would remind you that you live here only because the ministry of magic permits you certain areas of land 
 
 an arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing she let out an scream and threw her hands over her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously the sound of their wild neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving 
 
 whose forest is it now human bellowed bane 
 
 filthy she screamed her hands still tight over her head beasts uncontrolled animals 
 
 be quiet shouted hermione but it was too late umbridge pointed her wand at magorian and screamed incarcerous 
 
 ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes wrapping themselves tightly around the torso and trapping his arms he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs attempting to free himself while the other centaurs charged 
 
 harry grabbed hermione and pulled her to the ground face down on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him but the centaurs leapt over and around them bellowing and screaming with rage 
 
 nooooo he heard umbridge shriek noooooo i am senior undersecretary you cannotunhand me you animals nooooo 
 
 harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to stun one of them then she screamed very loudly lifting his head a few inches harry saw that umbridge had been seized from behind by bane and lifted high into the air wriggling and yelling with fright her wand fell from her hand to the ground and heart leapt if he could just reach it 
 
 but as he stretched out a hand towards it a hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half 
 
 now roared a voice in ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright hermione too had been pulled to her feet over the plunging backs and heads of the centaurs harry saw umbridge being borne away through the trees by bane screaming her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them 
 
 and these said the grey centaur holding hermione 
 
 they are young said a slow doleful voice from behind harry we do not attack foals 
 
 they brought her here ronan replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on harry and they are not so young he is nearing manhood this one 
 
 he shook harry by the neck of his robes 
 
 please said hermione breathlessly please attack us we think like her we ministry of magic employees we only came in here because we hoped drive her off for us 
 
 harry knew at once from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this the grey centaur threw back his head his back legs stamping furiously and bellowed you see ronan they already have the arrogance of their kind so we were to do your dirty work were we human girl we were to act as your servants drive away your enemies like obedient hounds 
 
 no said hermione in a horrorstruck squeak pleasei mean that i just hoped be able toto help us 
 
 but she seemed to be going from bad to worse 
 
 we do not help humans snarled the centaur holding harry tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time so that feet left the ground momentarily we are a race apart and proud to be so we will not permit you to walk from here boasting that we did your bidding 
 
 not going to say anything like that harry shouted we know you do what you did because we wanted you to 
 
 but nobody seemed to be listening to him 
 
 a bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted they came here unasked they must pay the consequences 
 
 a roar of approval met these words and a centaur shouted they can join the woman 
 
 you said you hurt the innocent shouted hermione real tears sliding down her face now we done anything to hurt you we used wands or threats we just want to go back to school please let us go back 
 
 we are not all like the traitor firenze human girl shouted the grey centaur to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses we are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults we do not recognise your laws we do not acknowledge your superiority we are 
 
 but they did not hear what else centaurs were for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them harry hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing looked around centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows hermione had been dropped too and harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of grawp the giant appeared in the gap 
 
 the centaurs nearest him backed into those behind the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the his dull eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet broken ropes trailed from both ankles 
 
 he opened his mouth even wider 
 
 hagger 
 
 harry did not know what hagger meant or what language it was from nor did he much care he was watching feet which were almost as long as whole body hermione gripped his arm tightly the centaurs were quite silent staring up at the giant whose huge round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped 
 
 hagger he said again more insistently 
 
 get away from here giant called magorian you are not welcome among us 
 
 these words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on grawp he stooped a little the centaurs arms tensed on their bows then bellowed hagger 
 
 a few of the centaurs looked worried now hermione however gave a gasp 
 
 harry she whispered i think trying to say hagrid 
 
 at this precise moment grawp caught sight of them the only two humans in a sea of centaurs he lowered his head another foot or so staring intently at them harry could feel hermione shaking as grawp opened his mouth wide again and said in a deep rumbling voice hermy 
 
 goodness said hermione gripping arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint hehe remembered 
 
 hermy roared grawp where hagger 
 
 i know squealed hermione terrified sorry grawp i know 
 
 grawp want hagger 
 
 one of the giants massive hands reached down hermione let out a real scream ran a few steps backwards and fell over devoid of a wand harry braced himself to punch kick bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a centaur off his legs 
 
 it was what the centaurs had been waiting outstretched fingers were a foot from harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant peppering his enormous face causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up rubbing his face with his enormous hands breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper 
 
 he yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaur scattered out of the way droplets of blood showered harry as he pulled hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees once there they looked back grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his face they were retreating in disorder galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing harry and hermione watched grawp give another roar of fury and plunge after them smashing more trees aside as he went 
 
 oh no said hermione quaking so badly that her knees gave way oh that was horrible and he might kill them all 
 
 not that fussed to be honest said harry bitterly 
 
 the sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter as harry listened to them his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him 
 
 they had wasted so much timethey were even further from rescuing sirius than they had been when he had had the vision not only had harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the forbidden forest with no means of transport whatsoever 
 
 smart plan he spat at hermione having to release some of his fury really smart plan where do we go from here 
 
 we need to get back up to the castle said hermione faintly 
 
 by the time done that probably be dead said harry kicking a nearby tree in temper a chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him 
 
 well we do anything without wands said hermione hopelessly dragging herself up again anyway harry how exactly were you planning to get all the way to london 
 
 yeah we were just wondering that said a familiar voice from behind her 
 
 harry and hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees 
 
 ron came into sight closely followed by ginny neville and luna all of them looked a little the worse for wearthere were several long scratches running the length of cheek a large purple lump was swelling above right eye lip was bleeding worse than everbut all were looking rather pleased with themselves 
 
 so said ron pushing aside a branch and holding out wand had any ideas 
 
 how did you get away asked harry in amazement taking his wand from ron 
 
 couple of stunners a disarming charm neville brought off a really nice little impediment jinx said ron airily now handing back wand too but ginny was best she got malfoybat bogey hexit was superb his whole face was covered in the great flapping things anyway we saw you out of the window heading into the forest and followed you done with umbridge 
 
 she got carried away said harry by a herd of centaurs 
 
 and they left you behind asked ginny looking astonished 
 
 no they got chased off by grawp said harry 
 
 grawp luna asked interestedly 
 
 little brother said ron promptly anyway never mind that now harry what did you find out in the fire has got sirius or 
 
 yes said harry as his scar gave another painful prickle and sure sirius is still alive but i see how going to get there to help him 
 
 they all fell silent looking rather scared the problem facing them seemed insurmountable 
 
 well have to fly we said luna in the closest thing to a voice harry had ever heard her use 
 
 ok said harry irritably rounding on her first of all we doing anything if including yourself in that and second of all me only one with a broomstick that being guarded by a security troll so 
 
 got a broom said ginny 
 
 yeah but not coming said ron angrily 
 
 excuse me but i care what happens to sirius as much as you do said ginny her jaw set so that her resemblance to fred and george was suddenly striking 
 
 too harry began but ginny said fiercely three years older than you were when you fought over the philosophers stone and because of me that stuck back in office with giant flying bogies attacking him 
 
 yeah but 
 
 we were all in the da together said neville quietly it was all supposed to be about fighting it and this is the first chance had to do something realor was that all just a game or something 
 
 noof course it said harry impatiently 
 
 then we should come too said neville simply we want to help 
 
 right said luna smiling happily 
 
 eyes met he knew ron was thinking exactly what he was if he could have chosen any members of the da in addition to himself ron and hermione to join him in the attempt to rescue sirius he would not have picked ginny neville or luna 
 
 well it matter anyway said harry through gritted teeth because we still know how to get there 
 
 i thought settled that said luna maddeningly flying 
 
 look said ron barely containing his anger you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us sprout wings whenever we 
 
 there are ways of flying other than with broomsticks said luna serenely 
 
 i going to ride on the back of the kacky snorgle or whatever it is ron demanded 
 
 the snorkack fly said luna in a dignified voice but they can and hagrid says very good at finding places their riders are looking for 
 
 harry whirled round standing between two trees their white eyes gleaming eerily were two thestrals watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word 
 
 yes he whispered moving towards them they tossed their reptilian heads throwing back long black manes and harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest shining neck how could he ever have thought them ugly 
 
 is it those mad horse things said ron uncertainly staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral harry was patting those ones you see unless watched someone snuff it 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 how many 
 
 just two 
 
 well we need three said hermione who was still looking a little shaken but determined just the same 
 
 four hermione said ginny scowling 
 
 i think there are six of us actually said luna calmly counting 
 
 be stupid we all go said harry angrily look you three he pointed at neville ginny and luna not involved in this not 
 
 they burst into more protests his scar gave another more painful twinge every moment they delayed was precious he did not have time to argue 
 
 ok fine your choice he said curtly but unless we can find more thestrals not going to be able 
 
 oh more of them will come said ginny confidently who like ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses 
 
 what makes you think that 
 
 because in case you noticed you and hermione are both covered in blood she said coolly and we know hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat probably why these two turned up in the first place 
 
 harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve which was damp with blood 
 
 ok then he said a bright idea occurring ron and i will take these two and go ahead and hermione can stay here with you three and attract more thestrals 
 
 not staying behind said hermione furiously 
 
 no need said luna smiling look here come more now you two must really smell 
 
 harry turned no fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking their way through the trees their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies their eyes gleaming through the darkness he had no excuse now 
 
 all right he said angrily pick one and get on then 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter fight and flightcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had no idea what hermione was planning or even whether she had a plan he walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside office knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going he did not dare attempt to talk to her umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing 
 
 hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall the din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the great hallit seemed incredible to harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner celebrating the end of exams not a care in the world 
 
 hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air the sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest now and as hermione marched purposefully across the grassumbridge jogging to keep uptheir long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks 
 
 hidden in hut is it said umbridge eagerly in ear 
 
 of course not said hermione scathingly hagrid might have set it off accidentally 
 
 yes said umbridge whose excitement seemed to be mounting yes he would have done of course the great oaf 
 
 she laughed harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat but resisted his scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned as he knew it would if voldemort had moved in for the kill 
 
 th en where is it asked umbridge with a hint or uncertainty in her voice as hermione continued to stride towards the forest 
 
 in there of course said hermione pointing into the dark trees it had to be somewhere that students going to find it accidentally it 
 
 of course said umbridge though she sounded a little apprehensive now of course very well then you two stay ahead of me 
 
 can we have your wand then if going first harry asked her 
 
 no i think so mr potter said umbridge sweetly poking him in the back with it the ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours afraid 
 
 as they reached the cool shade of the first trees harry tried to catch eye walking into the forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening she however merely gave umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees moving at such a pace that umbridge with her shorter legs had difficulty in keeping up 
 
 is it very far in umbridge asked as her robe ripped on a bramble 
 
 oh yes said hermione yes well hidden 
 
 misgivings increased hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit grawp but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster aragog hermione had not been with him on that occasion he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it 
 
 erare you sure this is the right way he asked her pointedly 
 
 oh yes she said in a steely voice crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise behind them umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling neither of them paused to help her up again hermione merely strode on calling loudly over her shoulder a bit further in 
 
 hermione keep your voice down harry muttered hurrying to catch up with her anything could be listening in here 
 
 i want us heard she answered quietly as umbridge jogged noisily after them see 
 
 they walked on for what seemed a long time until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest one of being watched by unseen eyes 
 
 how much further demanded umbridge angrily from behind him 
 
 not far now shouted hermione as they emerged into a dim dank clearing just a little bit 
 
 an arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head the air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves harry could feel the forest floor trembling umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield 
 
 he wrenched himself free of her and turned around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side their bows raised and loaded pointing at harry hermione and umbridge they backed slowly into the centre of the clearing umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror harry looked sideways at hermione she was wearing a triumphant smile 
 
 who are you said a voice 
 
 harry looked left the centaur called magorian was walking towards them out of the circle his bow like those of the others was raised on right umbridge was still whimpering her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur 
 
 i asked you who are you human said magorian roughly 
 
 i am dolores umbridge said umbridge in a terrified voice senior undersecretary to the minister for magic and headmistress and high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 you are from the ministry of magic said magorian as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly 
 
 right said umbridge in an even higher voice so be very careful by the laws laid down by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures any attack by such as yourselves on a human 
 
 what did you call us shouted a black centaur whom harry recognised as bane there was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them 
 
 call them that hermione said furiously but umbridge did not appear to have heard her still pointing her shaking wand at magorian she continued law fifteen b states clearly that any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have intelligence and therefore considered responsible for its actions 
 
 intelligence repeated magorian as bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground we consider that a great insult human our intelligence thankfully far outstrips your own 
 
 what are you doing in our forest bellowed the grey centaur harry and hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest why are you here 
 
 your forest said umbridge shaking now not only with fright but also it seemed with indignation i would remind you that you live here only because the ministry of magic permits you certain areas of land 
 
 an arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing she let out an scream and threw her hands over her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously the sound of their wild neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving 
 
 whose forest is it now human bellowed bane 
 
 filthy she screamed her hands still tight over her head beasts uncontrolled animals 
 
 be quiet shouted hermione but it was too late umbridge pointed her wand at magorian and screamed incarcerous 
 
 ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes wrapping themselves tightly around the torso and trapping his arms he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs attempting to free himself while the other centaurs charged 
 
 harry grabbed hermione and pulled her to the ground face down on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him but the centaurs leapt over and around them bellowing and screaming with rage 
 
 nooooo he heard umbridge shriek noooooo i am senior undersecretary you cannotunhand me you animals nooooo 
 
 harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to stun one of them then she screamed very loudly lifting his head a few inches harry saw that umbridge had been seized from behind by bane and lifted high into the air wriggling and yelling with fright her wand fell from her hand to the ground and heart leapt if he could just reach it 
 
 but as he stretched out a hand towards it a hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half 
 
 now roared a voice in ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright hermione too had been pulled to her feet over the plunging backs and heads of the centaurs harry saw umbridge being borne away through the trees by bane screaming her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them 
 
 and these said the grey centaur holding hermione 
 
 they are young said a slow doleful voice from behind harry we do not attack foals 
 
 they brought her here ronan replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on harry and they are not so young he is nearing manhood this one 
 
 he shook harry by the neck of his robes 
 
 please said hermione breathlessly please attack us we think like her we ministry of magic employees we only came in here because we hoped drive her off for us 
 
 harry knew at once from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this the grey centaur threw back his head his back legs stamping furiously and bellowed you see ronan they already have the arrogance of their kind so we were to do your dirty work were we human girl we were to act as your servants drive away your enemies like obedient hounds 
 
 no said hermione in a horrorstruck squeak pleasei mean that i just hoped be able toto help us 
 
 but she seemed to be going from bad to worse 
 
 we do not help humans snarled the centaur holding harry tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time so that feet left the ground momentarily we are a race apart and proud to be so we will not permit you to walk from here boasting that we did your bidding

 a bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted they came here unasked they must pay the consequences 
 
 a roar of approval met these words and a centaur shouted they can join the woman 
 
 you said you hurt the innocent shouted hermione real tears sliding down her face now we done anything to hurt you we used wands or threats we just want to go back to school please let us go back 
 
 we are not all like the traitor firenze human girl shouted the grey centaur to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses we are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults we do not recognise your laws we do not acknowledge your superiority we are

 he opened his mouth even wider 
 
 hagger 
 
 harry did not know what hagger meant or what language it was from nor did he much care he was watching feet which were almost as long as whole body hermione gripped his arm tightly the centaurs were quite silent staring up at the giant whose huge round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped 
 
 hagger he said again more insistently 
 
 get away from here giant called magorian you are not welcome among us

lionfish nov chapter the princes talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry remained kneeling at snapes side simply staring down at him until quite suddenly a high cold voice spoke so close to them that harry jumped on his feet the flask gripped tightly in his hands thinking that voldemort had reentered the room 
 
 voldemorts voice reverberated from the walls and floor and harry realized that he was talking to hogwarts and to all the surrounding area that the residents of hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them his breath on the back of their necks a deathblow away 
 
 you have fought said the high cold voice valiantly lord voldemort knows how to value bravery 
 
 yet you have sustained heavy losses if you continue to resist me you will all die one by one i do not wish this to happen every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste 
 
 lord voldemort is merciful i command my forces to retreat immediately 
 
 you have one hour dispose of your dead with dignity treat your injured 
 
 i speak now harry potter directly to you you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest if at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences this time i shall enter the fray myself harry potter and i shall find you and i shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me one hour 
 
 both ron and hermione shook their heads frantically looking at harry 
 
 dont listen to him said ron 
 
 itll be all right said hermione wildly lets c lets get back to the castle if hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan c 
 
 she glanced at snapes body then hurried back to the tunnel entrance ron followed her harry gathered up the invisibility cloak then looked down at snape he did not know what to feel except shock at the way snape had been killed and the reason for which it had been done 
 
 they crawled back through the tunnel none of them talking and harry wondered whether ron and hermione could still hear voldemort ringing in their heads as he could 
 
 you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forestone hour 
 
 small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle it could only be an hour or so from dawn yet it was the three of them hurried toward the stone steps a lone dog the size of a small boat lay abandoned in front of them there was no other sign of grawp or of his attacker 
 
 the castle was unnaturally silent there were no flashes of light now no bangs or screams or shouts the flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood part of the banisters had been blown away 
 
 where is everyone whispered hermione 
 
 ron led the way to the great hall harry stopped in the doorway 
 
 the house tables were gone and the room was crowded the survivors stood in groups their arms around each others necks the injured were being treated upon the raised platform by madam pomfrey and a group of helpers firenze was amongst the injured his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay unable to stand 
 
 the dead lay in a row in the middle of the hall harry could not see freds body because his family surrounded him george was kneeling at his head mrs weasley was lying across freds chest her body shaking mr weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks 
 
 without a word to harry ron and hermione walked away harry saw hermione approach ginny whose face was swollen and blotchy and hug her ron joined bill fleur and percy who flung an arm around rons shoulders as ginny and hermione moved closer to the rest of the family harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to fred remus and tonks pale and still and apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling 
 
 the great hall seemed to fly away become smaller shrink as harry reeled backward from the doorway he could not draw breath he could not bear to look at any of the other bodies to see who else had died for him he could not bear to join the weasleys could not look into their eyes when if he had given himself up in the first place fred might never have died 
 
 he turned away and ran up the marble staircase lupin tonks he yearned not to feel he wished he could rip out his heart his innards everything that was screaming inside him 
 
 the castle was completely empty even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the great hall harry ran without stopping clutching the crystal flask of snapes last thoughts and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmasters office 
 
 password 
 
 dumbledore said harry without thinking because it was he whom he yearned to see and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind 
 
 but when harry burst into the circular office he found a change the portraits that hung all around the walls were empty not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him all it seemed had flitted away charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on 
 
 harry glanced hopelessly at dumbledores deserted frame which hung directly behind the headmasters chair then turned his back on it the stone pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been harry heaved it onto the desk and poured snapes memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge to escape into someone elses head would be a blessed relief nothing that even snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts the memories swirled silver white and strange and without hesitating with a feeling of reckless abandonment as though this would assuage his torturing grief harry dived 
 
 he fell headlong into sunlight and his feet found warm ground when he straightened up he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground a single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline two girls were swinging backward and forward and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes his black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate too short jeans a shabby overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man an odd smocklike shirt 
 
 harry moved closer to the boy snape looked no more than nine or ten years old sallow small stringy there was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister 
 
 lily dont do it shrieked the elder of the two 
 
 but the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air quite literally flown launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt she soared like a trapeze artist through the air staying up far too long landing far too lightly 
 
 mummy told you not to 
 
 petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground making a crunching grinding sound then leapt up hands on hips 
 
 mummy said you werent allowed lily 
 
 but im fine said lily still giggling tuney look at this watch what i can do 
 
 petunia glanced around the playground was deserted apart from themselves and though the girls did not know it snape lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which snape lurked petunia advanced evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval lily waited until petunia was near enough to have a clear view then held out her palm the flower sat there opening and closing its petals like some bizarre oyster 
 
 stop it shrieked petunia 
 
 its not hurting you said lily but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground 
 
 its not right said petunia but her eyes had followed the flowers flight to the ground and lingered upon it how do you do it she added and there was definite longing in her voice 
 
 its obvious isnt it snape could no longer contain himself but had jumped out from behind the bushes petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings but lily though clearly startled remained where she was snape seemed to regret his appearance a dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at lily 
 
 whats obvious asked lily 
 
 snape had an air of nervous excitement with a glance at the distant petunia now hovering beside the swings he lowered his voice and said i know what you are 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 youreyoure a witch whispered snape 
 
 she looked affronted 
 
 thats not a very nice thing to say to somebody 
 
 she turned nose in the air and marched off toward her sister 
 
 no said snape he was highly colored now and harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it he flapped after the girls looking ludicrously batlike like his older self 
 
 the sisters considered him united in disapproval both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag 
 
 you are said snape to lily you are a witch ive been watching you for a while but theres nothing wrong with that my mums one and im a wizard 
 
 petunias laugh was like cold water 
 
 wizard she shrieked her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance i know who you are youre that snape boy they live down spinners end by the river she told lily and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation why have you been spying on us 
 
 havent been spying said snape hot and uncomfortable and in the bright sunlight wouldnt spy on you anyway he added spitefully youre a muggle 
 
 though petunia evidently did not understand the word she could hardly mistake the tone 
 
 lily come on were leaving she said shrilly lily obeyed her sister at once glaring at snape as she left he stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate and harry the only one left to observe him recognized snapes bitter disappointment and understood that snape had been planning this moment for a while and that it had all gone wrong 
 
 the scene dissolved and before harry knew it around him he was now in a small thicket of trees he could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks the shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade two children sat facing each other on the ground snape had removed his coat now his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light 
 
 and the ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters 
 
 but i have done magic outside school 
 
 were all right we havent got wands yet they let you off when youre a kid and you cant help it but once youre eleven he nodded importantly and they start training you then youve got to go careful 
 
 there was a little silence lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air and harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it then she dropped the twig leaned in toward the boy and said it is real isnt it its not a joke petunia says youre lying to me petunia says there isnt a hogwarts it is real isnt it 
 
 its real for us said snape not for her but well get the letter you and me 
 
 really whispered lily 
 
 definitely said snape and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her brimful of confidence in his destiny 
 
 and will it really come by owl lily whispered 
 
 normally said snape but youre so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents 
 
 does it make a difference being 
 
 snape hesitated his black eyes eager in the greenish gloom moved over the pale face the dark red hair 
 
 no he said it doesnt make any difference 
 
 good said lily relaxing it was clear that she had been worrying 
 
 youve got loads of magic said snape i saw that all the time i was watching you 
 
 his voice trailed away she was not listening but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead he watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground 
 
 how are things at your house lily asked 
 
 a little crease appeared between his eyes 
 
 fine he said 
 
 theyre not arguing anymore 
 
 oh yes theyre arguing said snape he picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart apparently unaware of what he was doing but it wont be that long and ill be gone 
 
 doesnt your dad like magic 
 
 he doesnt like anything much said snape 
 
 severus 
 
 a little smile twisted snapes mouth when she said his name 
 
 yeah 
 
 tell me about the dementors again 
 
 what dyou want to know about them for 
 
 if i use magic outside school c 
 
 they wouldnt give you to the dementors for that dementors are for people who do really bad stuff they guard the wizard prison azkaban youre not going to end up in azkaban youre too c 
 
 he turned red again and shredded more leaves then a small rustling noise behind harry made him turn petunia hiding behind a tree had lost her footing 
 
 tuney said lily surprise and welcome in her voice but snape had jumped to his feet 
 
 whos spying now he shouted what dyou want 
 
 petunia was breathless alarmed at being caught harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say 
 
 what is that youre wearing anyway she said pointing at snapes chest your mums blouse 
 
 there was a crack a branch over petunias head had fallen lily screamed the branch caught petunia on the shoulder and she staggered backward and burst into tears 
 
 tuney 
 
 but petunia was running away lily rounded on snape 
 
 did you make that happen 
 
 no he looked both defiant and scared 
 
 you did she was backing away from him you did you hurt her 
 
 no c no i didnt 
 
 but the lie did not convince lily after one last burning look she ran from the little thicket off after her sister and snape looked miserable and confused 
 
 and the scene harry looked around he was on platform nine and three quarters and snape stood beside him slightly hunched next to a thin woman who greatly resembled him snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away the two girls stood a little apart from their parents lily seemed to be pleading with her sister harry moved closer to listen 
 
 im sorry tuney im sorry listen c she caught her sisters hand and held tight to it even though petunia tried to pull it away maybe once im there c no listen tuney maybe once im there ill be able to go to professor dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind 
 
 i dont c want c to c go said petunia and she dragged her hand back out of her sisters grasp you think i want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a c a 
 
 her pale eyes roved over the platform over the cats mewling in their owners arms over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages over the students some already in their long black robes loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart 
 
 c you think i want to be a c a freak 
 
 lilys eyes filled with tears as petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away 
 
 im not a freak said lily thats a horrible thing to say 
 
 thats where youre going said petunia with relish a special school for freaks you and that snape boyweirdos thats what you two are its good youre being separated from normal people its for our safety 
 
 lily glanced toward her parents who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment drinking in the scene then she looked back at her sister and her voice was low and fierce 
 
 you didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you 
 
 petunia turned scarlet 
 
 beg i didnt beg 
 
 i saw his reply it was very kind 
 
 you shouldnt have read c whispered petunia that was my private c how could you c 
 
 lily gave herself away by toward where snape stood nearby petunia gasped 
 
 that boy found it you and that boy have been sneaking in my room 
 
 no c not sneaking c now lily was on the defensive severus saw the envelope and he couldnt believe a muggle could have contacted hogwarts thats all he says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of c 
 
 apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere said petunia now as pale as she had been flushed freak she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood 
 
 the scene dissolved again snape was hurrying along the corridor of the hogwarts express as it clattered through the countryside he had already changed into his school robes had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful muggle clothes at last he stopped outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking hunched in a corner seat beside the window was lily her face pressed against the windowpane 
 
 snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite lily she glanced at him and then looked back out of the window she had been crying 
 
 i dont want to talk to you she said in a constricted voice 
 
 why not 
 
 tuney me because we saw that letter from dumbledore 
 
 so what 
 
 she threw him a look of deep dislike 
 
 so shes my sister 
 
 shes only a c he caught himself quickly lily too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed did not hear him 
 
 but were going he said unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice this is it were off to hogwarts 
 
 she nodded mopping her eyes but in spite of herself she half smiled 
 
 youd better be in slytherin said snape encouraged that she had brightened a little 
 
 slytherin 
 
 one of the boys sharing the compartment who had shown no interest at all in lily or snape until that point looked around at the word and harry whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window saw his father slight like snape but with that indefinable air of having been even adored that snape so conspicuously lacked 
 
 who wants to be in slytherin i think id leave wouldnt you james asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him and with a jolt harry realized that it was sirius sirius did not smile 
 
 my whole family have been in slytherin he said 
 
 blimey said james and i thought you seemed all right 
 
 sirius grinned 
 
 maybe ill break the tradition where are you heading if youve got the choice 
 
 james lifted an invisible sword 
 
 gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart like my dad 
 
 snape made a small disparaging noise james turned on him 
 
 got a problem with that 
 
 no said snape though his slight sneer said otherwise if youd rather be brawny than brainy c 
 
 wherere you hoping to go seeing as youre neither interjected sirius 
 
 james roared with laughter lily sat up rather flushed and looked from james to sirius in dislike 
 
 come on severus lets find another compartment 
 
 oooooo 
 
 james and sirius imitated her lofty voice james tried to trip snape as he passed 
 
 see ya snivellus a voice called as the compartment door slammed 
 
 and the scene dissolved once more 
 
 harry was standing right behind snape as they faced the candlelit house tables lined with rapt faces then professor mcgonagall said evans lily 
 
 he watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool professor mcgonagall dropped the sorting hat onto her head and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the hat cried gryffindor 
 
 harry heard snape let out a tiny groan lily took off the hat handed it back to professor mcgonagall then hurried toward the cheering gryffindors but as she went she glanced back at snape and there was a sad little smile on her face harry saw sirius move up the bench to make room for her she took one look at him seemed to recognize him from the train folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him 
 
 the roll call continued harry watched lupin pettigrew and his father join lily and sirius at the gryffindor table at last when only a dozen students remained to be sorted professor mcgonagall called snape 
 
 harry walked with him to the stool watched him place the hat upon his head slytherin cried the sorting hat 
 
 and severus snape moved off to the other side of the hall away from lily to where the slytherins were cheering him to where lucius malfoy a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest patted snape on the back as he sat down beside him 
 
 and the scene changed 
 
 lily and snape were walking across the castle courtyard evidently arguing harry hurried to catch up with them to listen in as he reached them he realized how much taller they both were a few years seemed to have passed since their sorting 
 
 thought we were supposed to be friends snape was saying best friends 
 
 we are sev but i dont like some of the people youre hanging round with im sorry but i detest avery and mulciber mulciber what do you see in him sev hes creepy dyou know what he tried to do to mary macdonald the other day 
 
 lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it looking up into the thin sallow face 
 
 that was nothing said snape it was a laugh thats all c 
 
 it was dark magic and if you think thats funny c 
 
 what about the stuff potter and his mates get up to demanded snape his color rose again as he said it unable it seemed to hold in his resentment 
 
 whats potter got to do with anything said lily 
 
 they sneak out at night theres something weird about that lupin where does he keep going 
 
 hes ill said lily they say hes ill c 
 
 every month at the full moon said snape 
 
 i know your theory said lily and she sounded cold why are you so obsessed with them anyway why do you care what theyre doing at night 
 
 im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are 
 
 the intensity of his gaze made her blush 
 
 they dont use dark magic though she dropped her voice and youre being really ungrateful i heard what happened the other night you went sneaking down that tunnel by the whomping willow and james potter saved you from whatevers down there c 
 
 snapes whole face contorted and he spluttered saved saved you think he was playing the hero he was saving his neck and his friends too youre not going to c i wont let you c 
 
 let me let me 
 
 lilys bright green eyes were slits snape backtracked at once 
 
 i didnt mean c i just dont want to see you made a fool of c he fancies you james potter fancies you the words seemed wrenched from him against his will and hes noteveryone thinksbig quidditch hero c snapes bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent and lilys eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead 
 
 i know james potters an arrogant toerag she said cutting across snape i dont need you to tell me that but mulcibers and averys idea of humor is just evil evil sev i dont understand how you can be friends with them 
 
 harry doubted that snape had even heard her strictures on mulciber and avery the moment she had insulted james potter his whole body had relaxed and as they walked away there was a new spring in snapes step 
 
 and the scene dissolved 
 
 harry watched again as snape left the great hall after sitting his in defense against the dark arts watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where james sirius lupin and pettigrew sat together but harry kept his distance this time because he knew what happened after james had hoisted severus into the air and taunted him he knew what had been done and said and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again he watched as lily joined the group and went to snapes defense distantly he heard snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury the unforgivable word mudblood 
 
 the scene changed 
 
 im sorry 
 
 im not interested 
 
 im sorry 
 
 save your breath 
 
 it was nighttime lily who was wearing a dressing gown stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the fat lady at the entrance to gryffindor tower 
 
 i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here 
 
 i was i would have done i never meant to call you mudblood it just c 
 
 slipped out there was no pity in lilys voice its too late ive made excuses for you for years none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you you and your precious little death eater friends c you see you dont even deny it you dont even deny thats what youre all aiming to be you cant wait to join can you 
 
 he opened his mouth but closed it without speaking 
 
 i cant pretend anymore youve chosen your way ive chosen mine 
 
 no c listen i didnt mean c 
 
 c to call me mudblood but you call everyone of my birth mudblood severus why should i be any different 
 
 he struggled on the verge of speech but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole 
 
 the corridor dissolved and the scene took a little longer to reform harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop forlorn and cold in the darkness the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees the adult snape was panting turning on the spot his wand gripped tightly in his hand waiting for something or for someone his fear infected harry too even though he knew that he could not be harmed and he looked over his shoulder wondering what it was that snape was waiting for c then a blinding jagged jet of white light flew through the air harry thought of lightning but snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand 
 
 dont kill me 
 
 that was not my intention 
 
 any sound of dumbledore apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches he stood before snape with his robes whipping around him and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand 
 
 well severus what message does lord voldemort have for me 
 
 no c no message c im here on my own account 
 
 snape was wringing his hands he looked a little mad with his straggling black hair flying around him 
 
 i c i come with a warning c no a request c please c 
 
 dumbledore flicked his wand though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and snape faced each other 
 
 what request could a death eater make of me 
 
 the c the prophecythe predictiontrelawney 
 
 ah yes said dumbledore how much did you relay to lord voldemort 
 
 everything c everything i heard said snape that is why c it is for that reason c he thinks it means lily evans 
 
 the prophecy did not refer to a woman said dumbledore it spoke of a boy born at the end of july c 
 
 you know what i mean he thinks it means her son he is going to hunt her down c kill them all c 
 
 if she means so much to you said dumbledore surely lord voldemort will spare her could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son 
 
 i have c i have asked him c 
 
 you disgust me said dumbledore and harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice snape seemed to shrink a little you do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child they can die as long as you have what you want 
 
 snape said nothing but merely looked up at dumbledore 
 
 hide them all then he croaked keep her c them c safe please 
 
 and what will you give me in return severus 
 
 in c in return snape gaped at dumbledore and harry expected him to protest but after a long moment he said anything 
 
 the hilltop faded and harry stood in dumbledores office and something was making a terrible sound like a wounded animal snape was slumped forward in a chair and dumbledore was standing over him looking grim after a moment or two snape raised his face and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop 
 
 i thoughtyou were goingto keep hersafe 
 
 she and james put their faith in the wrong person said dumbledore rather like you severus werent you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her 
 
 snapes breathing was shallow 
 
 her boy survives said dumbledore 
 
 with a tiny jerk of the head snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly 
 
 her son lives he has her eyes precisely her eyes you remember the shape and color of lily evanss eyes i am sure 
 
 dont bellowed snape gonedead 
 
 is this remorse severus 
 
 i wishi wish i were dead 
 
 and what use would that be to anyone said dumbledore coldly if you loved lily evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear 
 
 snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain and dumbledores words appeared to take a long time to reach him 
 
 what c what do you mean 
 
 you know how and why she died make sure it was not in vain help me protect lilys son 
 
 he does not need protection the dark lord has gone c 
 
 the dark lord will return and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does 
 
 there was a long pause and slowly snape regained control of himself mastered his own breathing at last he said very well very well but never c never tell dumbledore this must be between us swear it i cannot bearespecially potters soni want your word 
 
 my word severus that i shall never reveal the best of you dumbledore sighed looking down into snapes ferocious anguished face if you insist 
 
 the office dissolved but instantly snape was pacing up and down in front of dumbledore 
 
 c mediocre arrogant as his father a determined delighted to find himself famous and impertinent c 
 
 you see what you expect to see severus said dumbledore without raising his eyes from a copy of transfiguration today other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented personally i find him an engaging child 
 
 dumbledore turned a page and said without looking up keep an eye on quirrell wont you 
 
 a whirl of color and now everything darkened and snape and dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall while the last stragglers from the yule ball passed them on their way to bed 
 
 well murmured dumbledore 
 
 karkaroffs mark is becoming darker too he is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell snape looked sideways at dumbledores profile karkaroff intends to flee if the mark burns 
 
 does he said dumbledore softly as fleur delacour and roger davies came giggling in from the grounds and are you tempted to join him 
 
 no said snape his black eyes on fleurs and rogers retreating figures i am not such a coward 
 
 no agreed dumbledore you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff you know i sometimes think we sort too soon 
 
 he walked away leaving snape looking stricken 
 
 and now harry stood in the headmasters office yet again it was nighttime and dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk apparently semiconscious his right hand dangled over the side blackened and burned snape was muttering incantations pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down dumbledores throat after a moment or two dumbledores eyelids fluttered and opened 
 
 why said snape without preamble why did you put on that ring it carries a curse surely you realized that why even touch it 
 
 marvolo gaunts ring lay on the desk before dumbledore it was cracked the sword of gryffindor lay beside it 
 
 dumbledore grimaced 
 
 iwas a fool sorely tempted 
 
 tempted by what 
 
 dumbledore did not answer 
 
 it is a miracle you managed to return here snape sounded furious that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being c 
 
 dumbledore raised his blackened useless hand and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio 
 
 you have done very well severus how long do you think i have 
 
 dumbledores tone was conversational he might have been asking for a weather forecast snape hesitated and then said i cannot tell maybe a year there is no halting such a spell forever it will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time 
 
 dumbledore smiled the news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him 
 
 i am fortunate extremely fortunate that i have you severus 
 
 if you had only summoned me a little earlier i might have been able to do more buy you more time said snape furiously he looked down at the broken ring and the sword did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse 
 
 something like thati was delirious no doubt said dumbledore with an effort he straightened himself in his chair well really this makes matters much more straightforward 
 
 snape looked utterly perplexed dumbledore smiled 
 
 i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me 
 
 snape sat down in the chair harry had so often occupied across the desk from dumbledore harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of dumbledores cursed hand but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further scowling snape said the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed this is merely punishment for luciuss recent failures slow torture for dracos parents while they watch him fail and pay the price 
 
 in short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have said dumbledore now i should have thought the natural successor to the job once draco fails is yourself 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 that i think is the dark lords plan 
 
 lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at hogwarts 
 
 he believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes 
 
 and if it does fall into his grasp said dumbledore almost it seemed as an aside i have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at hogwarts 
 
 snape gave a stiff nod 
 
 good now then your first priority will be to discover what draco is up to a frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself offer him help and guidance he ought to accept he likes you c 
 
 c much less since his father has lost favor draco blames me he thinks i have usurped luciuss position 
 
 all the same try i am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from lord voldemorts wrath 
 
 snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked are you intending to let him kill you 
 
 certainly not you must kill me 
 
 there was a long silence broken only by an odd clicking noise fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone 
 
 would you like me to do it now asked snape his voice heavy with irony or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph 
 
 oh not quite yet said dumbledore smiling i daresay the moment will present itself in due course given what has happened tonight he indicated his withered hand we can be sure that it will happen within a year 
 
 if you dont mind dying said snape roughly why not let draco do it 
 
 that boys soul is not yet so damaged said dumbledore i would not have it ripped apart on my account 
 
 and my soul dumbledore mine 
 
 you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation said dumbledore i ask this one great favor of you severus because death is coming for me as surely as the chudley cannons will finish bottom of this years league i confess i should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance greyback is involved c i hear voldemort has recruited him or dear bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it 
 
 his tone was light but his blue eyes pierced snape as they had frequently pierced harry as though the soul they discussed was visible to him at last snape gave another curt nod 
 
 dumbledore seemed satisfied 
 
 thank you severus 
 
 the office disappeared and now snape and dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight 
 
 what are you doing with potter all these evenings you are closeted together snape asked abruptly 
 
 dumbledore looked weary 
 
 why you arent trying to give him more detentions severus the boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out 
 
 he is his father over again c 
 
 in looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers i spend time with harry because i have things to discuss with him information i must give him before it is too late 
 
 information repeated snape you trust himyou do not trust me 
 
 it is not a question of trust i have as we both know limited time it is essential that i give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do 
 
 and why may i not have the same information 
 
 i prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of lord voldemort 
 
 which i do on your orders 
 
 and you do it extremely well do not think that i underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself severus to give voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job i would entrust to nobody but you 
 
 yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the dark lords mind 
 
 voldemort fears that connection said dumbledore not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing harrys mind means to him it was pain such as he has never experienced he will not try to possess harry again i am sure of it not in that way 
 
 i dont understand 
 
 lord voldemorts soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like harrys like a tongue on frozen steel like flesh in flame c 
 
 souls we were talking of minds 
 
 in the case of harry and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other 
 
 dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone they were close by the forbidden forest now but there was no sign of anyone near them 
 
 after you have killed me severus c 
 
 you refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me snarled snape and real anger flared in the thin face now you take a great deal for granted dumbledore perhaps i have changed my mind 
 
 you gave me your word severus and while we are talking about services you owe me i thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young slytherin friend 
 
 snape looked angry mutinous dumbledore sighed 
 
 come to my office tonight severus at eleven and you shall not complain that i have no confidence in you 
 
 they were back in dumbledores office the windows dark and fawkes sat silent as snape sat quite still as dumbledore walked around him talking 
 
 harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done 
 
 but what must he do 
 
 that is between harry and me now listen closely severus there will come a time c after my death c do not argue do not interrupt there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake 
 
 for nagini snape looked astonished 
 
 precisely if there comes a time when lord voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then i think it will be safe to tell harry 
 
 tell him what 
 
 dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes 
 
 tell him that on the night lord voldemort tried to kill him when lily cast her own life between them as a shield the killing curse rebounded upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building part of lord voldemort lives inside harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with lord voldemorts mind that he has never understood and while that fragment of soul unmissed by voldemort remains attached to and protected by harry lord voldemort cannot die 
 
 harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voices echoing strangely in his ears 
 
 so the boythe boy must die asked snape quite calmly 
 
 and voldemort himself must do it severus that is essential 
 
 another long silence then snape said i thoughtall those yearsthat we were protecting him for her for lily 
 
 we have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength said dumbledore his eyes still tight shut meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth sometimes i have thought he suspects it himself if i know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of voldemort 
 
 dumbledore opened his eyes snape looked horrified 
 
 you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment 
 
 dont be shocked severus how many men and women have you watched die 
 
 lately only those whom i could not save said snape he stood up you have used me 
 
 meaning 
 
 i have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you everything was supposed to be to keep lily potters son safe now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter c 
 
 but this is touching severus said dumbledore seriously have you grown to care for the boy after all 
 
 for him shouted snape expecto patronum 
 
 from the tip of his wand burst the silver doe she landed on the office floor bounded once across the office and soared out of the window dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears 
 
 after all this time 
 
 always said snape 
 
 and the scene shifted now harry saw snape talking to the portrait of dumbledore behind his desk 
 
 you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harrys departure from his aunt and uncles said dumbledore not to do so will raise suspicion when voldemort believes you so well informed however you must plant the idea of decoys that i think ought to ensure harrys safety try confunding mundungus fletcher and severus if you are forced to take part in the chase be sure to act your part convincinglyi am counting upon you to remain in lord voldemorts good books as long as possible or hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the carrows 
 
 now snape was head to head with mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern mundunguss face looking curiously blank snape frowning in concentration 
 
 you will suggest to the order of the phoenix snape murmured that they use decoys polyjuice potion identical potters its the only thing that might work you will forget that i have suggested this you will present it as your own idea you understand 
 
 i understand murmured mundungus his eyes unfocused 
 
 now harry was flying alongside snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night he was accompanied by other hodded death eaters and ahead were lupin and a harry who was really george a death eater moved ahead of snape and raised his wand pointing it directly at lupins back 
 
 sectumsempra shouted snape 
 
 but the spell intended for the death eaters wand hand missed and hit george instead c 
 
 and next snape was kneeling in siriuss old bedroom tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from lily the second page carried only a few words could ever have been friends with gellert grindelwald i think her minds going personally 
 
 lots of love lily 
 
 snape took the page bearing lilys signature and her love and tucked it inside his robes then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding so that he kept the part from which lily laughed throwing the portion showing james and harry back onto the floor under the chest of drawers 
 
 and now snape stood again in the headmasters study as phineas nigellus came hurrying into his portrait 
 
 headmaster they are camping in the forest of dean the mudblood c 
 
 do not use that word 
 
 c the granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and i heard her 
 
 good very good cried the portrait of dumbledore behind the headmasters chair now severus the sword do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor c and he must not know that you give it if voldemort should read harrys mind and see you acting for him c 
 
 i know said snape curtly he approached the portrait of dumbledore and pulled at its side it swung forward revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of gryffindor 
 
 and you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give potter the sword said snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes 
 
 no i dont think so said dumbledores portrait he will know what to do with it and severus be very careful they may not take kindly to your appearance after george weasleys mishap c 
 
 snape turned at the door 
 
 dont worry dumbledore he said coolly i have a plan 
 
 and snape left the room harry rose up out of the pensieve and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms snape might just have closed the door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter the princes talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry remained kneeling at snapes side simply staring down at him until quite suddenly a high cold voice spoke so close to them that harry jumped on his feet the flask gripped tightly in his hands thinking that voldemort had reentered the room 
 
 voldemorts voice reverberated from the walls and floor and harry realized that he was talking to hogwarts and to all the surrounding area that the residents of hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them his breath on the back of their necks a deathblow away 
 
 you have fought said the high cold voice valiantly lord voldemort knows how to value bravery 
 
 yet you have sustained heavy losses if you continue to resist me you will all die one by one i do not wish this to happen every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste 
 
 lord voldemort is merciful i command my forces to retreat immediately 
 
 you have one hour dispose of your dead with dignity treat your injured 
 
 i speak now harry potter directly to you you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest if at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences this time i shall enter the fray myself harry potter and i shall find you and i shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me one hour 
 
 both ron and hermione shook their heads frantically looking at harry 
 
 dont listen to him said ron 
 
 itll be all right said hermione wildly lets c lets get back to the castle if hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan c 
 
 she glanced at snapes body then hurried back to the tunnel entrance ron followed her harry gathered up the invisibility cloak then looked down at snape he did not know what to feel except shock at the way snape had been killed and the reason for which it had been done 
 
 they crawled back through the tunnel none of them talking and harry wondered whether ron and hermione could still hear voldemort ringing in their heads as he could 
 
 you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forestone hour 
 
 small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle it could only be an hour or so from dawn yet it was the three of them hurried toward the stone steps a lone dog the size of a small boat lay abandoned in front of them there was no other sign of grawp or of his attacker 
 
 the castle was unnaturally silent there were no flashes of light now no bangs or screams or shouts the flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood part of the banisters had been blown away 
 
 where is everyone whispered hermione 
 
 ron led the way to the great hall harry stopped in the doorway 
 
 the house tables were gone and the room was crowded the survivors stood in groups their arms around each others necks the injured were being treated upon the raised platform by madam pomfrey and a group of helpers firenze was amongst the injured his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay unable to stand 
 
 the dead lay in a row in the middle of the hall harry could not see freds body because his family surrounded him george was kneeling at his head mrs weasley was lying across freds chest her body shaking mr weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks 
 
 without a word to harry ron and hermione walked away harry saw hermione approach ginny whose face was swollen and blotchy and hug her ron joined bill fleur and percy who flung an arm around rons shoulders as ginny and hermione moved closer to the rest of the family harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to fred remus and tonks pale and still and apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling 
 
 the great hall seemed to fly away become smaller shrink as harry reeled backward from the doorway he could not draw breath he could not bear to look at any of the other bodies to see who else had died for him he could not bear to join the weasleys could not look into their eyes when if he had given himself up in the first place fred might never have died 
 
 he turned away and ran up the marble staircase lupin tonks he yearned not to feel he wished he could rip out his heart his innards everything that was screaming inside him 
 
 the castle was completely empty even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the great hall harry ran without stopping clutching the crystal flask of snapes last thoughts and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmasters office 
 
 password 
 
 dumbledore said harry without thinking because it was he whom he yearned to see and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind 
 
 but when harry burst into the circular office he found a change the portraits that hung all around the walls were empty not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him all it seemed had flitted away charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on 
 
 harry glanced hopelessly at dumbledores deserted frame which hung directly behind the headmasters chair then turned his back on it the stone pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been harry heaved it onto the desk and poured snapes memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge to escape into someone elses head would be a blessed relief nothing that even snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts the memories swirled silver white and strange and without hesitating with a feeling of reckless abandonment as though this would assuage his torturing grief harry dived 
 
 he fell headlong into sunlight and his feet found warm ground when he straightened up he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground a single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline two girls were swinging backward and forward and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes his black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate too short jeans a shabby overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man an odd smocklike shirt 
 
 harry moved closer to the boy snape looked no more than nine or ten years old sallow small stringy there was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister 
 
 lily dont do it shrieked the elder of the two 
 
 but the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air quite literally flown launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt she soared like a trapeze artist through the air staying up far too long landing far too lightly 
 
 mummy told you not to 
 
 petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground making a crunching grinding sound then leapt up hands on hips 
 
 mummy said you werent allowed lily 
 
 but im fine said lily still giggling tuney look at this watch what i can do 
 
 petunia glanced around the playground was deserted apart from themselves and though the girls did not know it snape lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which snape lurked petunia advanced evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval lily waited until petunia was near enough to have a clear view then held out her palm the flower sat there opening and closing its petals like some bizarre oyster 
 
 stop it shrieked petunia 
 
 its not hurting you said lily but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground 
 
 its not right said petunia but her eyes had followed the flowers flight to the ground and lingered upon it how do you do it she added and there was definite longing in her voice 
 
 its obvious isnt it snape could no longer contain himself but had jumped out from behind the bushes petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings but lily though clearly startled remained where she was snape seemed to regret his appearance a dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at lily 
 
 whats obvious asked lily 
 
 snape had an air of nervous excitement with a glance at the distant petunia now hovering beside the swings he lowered his voice and said i know what you are 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 youreyoure a witch whispered snape 
 
 she looked affronted 
 
 thats not a very nice thing to say to somebody 
 
 she turned nose in the air and marched off toward her sister 
 
 no said snape he was highly colored now and harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it he flapped after the girls looking ludicrously batlike like his older self 
 
 the sisters considered him united in disapproval both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag 
 
 you are said snape to lily you are a witch ive been watching you for a while but theres nothing wrong with that my mums one and im a wizard 
 
 petunias laugh was like cold water 
 
 wizard she shrieked her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance i know who you are youre that snape boy they live down spinners end by the river she told lily and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation why have you been spying on us 
 
 havent been spying said snape hot and uncomfortable and in the bright sunlight wouldnt spy on you anyway he added spitefully youre a muggle 
 
 though petunia evidently did not understand the word she could hardly mistake the tone 
 
 lily come on were leaving she said shrilly lily obeyed her sister at once glaring at snape as she left he stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate and harry the only one left to observe him recognized snapes bitter disappointment and understood that snape had been planning this moment for a while and that it had all gone wrong 
 
 the scene dissolved and before harry knew it around him he was now in a small thicket of trees he could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks the shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade two children sat facing each other on the ground snape had removed his coat now his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light 
 
 and the ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters 
 
 but i have done magic outside school 
 
 were all right we havent got wands yet they let you off when youre a kid and you cant help it but once youre eleven he nodded importantly and they start training you then youve got to go careful 
 
 there was a little silence lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air and harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it then she dropped the twig leaned in toward the boy and said it is real isnt it its not a joke petunia says youre lying to me petunia says there isnt a hogwarts it is real isnt it 
 
 its real for us said snape not for her but well get the letter you and me 
 
 really whispered lily 
 
 definitely said snape and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her brimful of confidence in his destiny 
 
 and will it really come by owl lily whispered 
 
 normally said snape but youre so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents 
 
 does it make a difference being 
 
 snape hesitated his black eyes eager in the greenish gloom moved over the pale face the dark red hair 
 
 no he said it doesnt make any difference 
 
 good said lily relaxing it was clear that she had been worrying 
 
 youve got loads of magic said snape i saw that all the time i was watching you 
 
 his voice trailed away she was not listening but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead he watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground 
 
 how are things at your house lily asked 
 
 a little crease appeared between his eyes 
 
 fine he said 
 
 theyre not arguing anymore 
 
 oh yes theyre arguing said snape he picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart apparently unaware of what he was doing but it wont be that long and ill be gone 
 
 doesnt your dad like magic 
 
 he doesnt like anything much said snape 
 
 severus 
 
 a little smile twisted snapes mouth when she said his name 
 
 yeah 
 
 tell me about the dementors again 
 
 what dyou want to know about them for 
 
 if i use magic outside school c 
 
 they wouldnt give you to the dementors for that dementors are for people who do really bad stuff they guard the wizard prison azkaban youre not going to end up in azkaban youre too c 
 
 he turned red again and shredded more leaves then a small rustling noise behind harry made him turn petunia hiding behind a tree had lost her footing 
 
 tuney said lily surprise and welcome in her voice but snape had jumped to his feet 
 
 whos spying now he shouted what dyou want 
 
 petunia was breathless alarmed at being caught harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say 
 
 what is that youre wearing anyway she said pointing at snapes chest your mums blouse 
 
 there was a crack a branch over petunias head had fallen lily screamed the branch caught petunia on the shoulder and she staggered backward and burst into tears 
 
 tuney 
 
 but petunia was running away lily rounded on snape 
 
 did you make that happen 
 
 no he looked both defiant and scared 
 
 you did she was backing away from him you did you hurt her 
 
 no c no i didnt 
 
 but the lie did not convince lily after one last burning look she ran from the little thicket off after her sister and snape looked miserable and confused 
 
 and the scene harry looked around he was on platform nine and three quarters and snape stood beside him slightly hunched next to a thin woman who greatly resembled him snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away the two girls stood a little apart from their parents lily seemed to be pleading with her sister harry moved closer to listen 
 
 im sorry tuney im sorry listen c she caught her sisters hand and held tight to it even though petunia tried to pull it away maybe once im there c no listen tuney maybe once im there ill be able to go to professor dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind 
 
 i dont c want c to c go said petunia and she dragged her hand back out of her sisters grasp you think i want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a c a 
 
 her pale eyes roved over the platform over the cats mewling in their owners arms over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages over the students some already in their long black robes loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart 
 
 c you think i want to be a c a freak 
 
 lilys eyes filled with tears as petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away 
 
 im not a freak said lily thats a horrible thing to say 
 
 thats where youre going said petunia with relish a special school for freaks you and that snape boyweirdos thats what you two are its good youre being separated from normal people its for our safety 
 
 lily glanced toward her parents who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment drinking in the scene then she looked back at her sister and her voice was low and fierce 
 
 you didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you 
 
 petunia turned scarlet 
 
 beg i didnt beg 
 
 i saw his reply it was very kind 
 
 you shouldnt have read c whispered petunia that was my private c how could you c 
 
 lily gave herself away by toward where snape stood nearby petunia gasped 
 
 that boy found it you and that boy have been sneaking in my room 
 
 no c not sneaking c now lily was on the defensive severus saw the envelope and he couldnt believe a muggle could have contacted hogwarts thats all he says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of c 
 
 apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere said petunia now as pale as she had been flushed freak she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood 
 
 the scene dissolved again snape was hurrying along the corridor of the hogwarts express as it clattered through the countryside he had already changed into his school robes had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful muggle clothes at last he stopped outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking hunched in a corner seat beside the window was lily her face pressed against the windowpane 
 
 snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite lily she glanced at him and then looked back out of the window she had been crying 
 
 i dont want to talk to you she said in a constricted voice 
 
 why not 
 
 tuney me because we saw that letter from dumbledore 
 
 so what 
 
 she threw him a look of deep dislike 
 
 so shes my sister 
 
 shes only a c he caught himself quickly lily too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed did not hear him 
 
 but were going he said unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice this is it were off to hogwarts 
 
 she nodded mopping her eyes but in spite of herself she half smiled 
 
 youd better be in slytherin said snape encouraged that she had brightened a little 
 
 slytherin 
 
 one of the boys sharing the compartment who had shown no interest at all in lily or snape until that point looked around at the word and harry whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window saw his father slight like snape but with that indefinable air of having been even adored that snape so conspicuously lacked 
 
 who wants to be in slytherin i think id leave wouldnt you james asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him and with a jolt harry realized that it was sirius sirius did not smile 
 
 my whole family have been in slytherin he said 
 
 blimey said james and i thought you seemed all right 
 
 sirius grinned 
 
 maybe ill break the tradition where are you heading if youve got the choice 
 
 james lifted an invisible sword 
 
 gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart like my dad 
 
 snape made a small disparaging noise james turned on him 
 
 got a problem with that 
 
 no said snape though his slight sneer said otherwise if youd rather be brawny than brainy c 
 
 wherere you hoping to go seeing as youre neither interjected sirius 
 
 james roared with laughter lily sat up rather flushed and looked from james to sirius in dislike 
 
 come on severus lets find another compartment 
 
 oooooo 
 
 james and sirius imitated her lofty voice james tried to trip snape as he passed 
 
 see ya snivellus a voice called as the compartment door slammed 
 
 and the scene dissolved once more 
 
 harry was standing right behind snape as they faced the candlelit house tables lined with rapt faces then professor mcgonagall said evans lily 
 
 he watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool professor mcgonagall dropped the sorting hat onto her head and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the hat cried gryffindor 
 
 harry heard snape let out a tiny groan lily took off the hat handed it back to professor mcgonagall then hurried toward the cheering gryffindors but as she went she glanced back at snape and there was a sad little smile on her face harry saw sirius move up the bench to make room for her she took one look at him seemed to recognize him from the train folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him 
 
 the roll call continued harry watched lupin pettigrew and his father join lily and sirius at the gryffindor table at last when only a dozen students remained to be sorted professor mcgonagall called snape 
 
 harry walked with him to the stool watched him place the hat upon his head slytherin cried the sorting hat 
 
 and severus snape moved off to the other side of the hall away from lily to where the slytherins were cheering him to where lucius malfoy a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest patted snape on the back as he sat down beside him 
 
 and the scene changed 
 
 lily and snape were walking across the castle courtyard evidently arguing harry hurried to catch up with them to listen in as he reached them he realized how much taller they both were a few years seemed to have passed since their sorting 
 
 thought we were supposed to be friends snape was saying best friends 
 
 we are sev but i dont like some of the people youre hanging round with im sorry but i detest avery and mulciber mulciber what do you see in him sev hes creepy dyou know what he tried to do to mary macdonald the other day 
 
 lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it looking up into the thin sallow face 
 
 that was nothing said snape it was a laugh thats all c 
 
 it was dark magic and if you think thats funny c 
 
 what about the stuff potter and his mates get up to demanded snape his color rose again as he said it unable it seemed to hold in his resentment 
 
 whats potter got to do with anything said lily 
 
 they sneak out at night theres something weird about that lupin where does he keep going 
 
 hes ill said lily they say hes ill c 
 
 every month at the full moon said snape 
 
 i know your theory said lily and she sounded cold why are you so obsessed with them anyway why do you care what theyre doing at night 
 
 im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are 
 
 the intensity of his gaze made her blush 
 
 they dont use dark magic though she dropped her voice and youre being really ungrateful i heard what happened the other night you went sneaking down that tunnel by the whomping willow and james potter saved you from whatevers down there c 
 
 snapes whole face contorted and he spluttered saved saved you think he was playing the hero he was saving his neck and his friends too youre not going to c i wont let you c 
 
 let me let me 
 
 lilys bright green eyes were slits snape backtracked at once 
 
 i didnt mean c i just dont want to see you made a fool of c he fancies you james potter fancies you the words seemed wrenched from him against his will and hes noteveryone thinksbig quidditch hero c snapes bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent and lilys eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead 
 
 i know james potters an arrogant toerag she said cutting across snape i dont need you to tell me that but mulcibers and averys idea of humor is just evil evil sev i dont understand how you can be friends with them 
 
 harry doubted that snape had even heard her strictures on mulciber and avery the moment she had insulted james potter his whole body had relaxed and as they walked away there was a new spring in snapes step 
 
 and the scene dissolved 
 
 harry watched again as snape left the great hall after sitting his in defense against the dark arts watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where james sirius lupin and pettigrew sat together but harry kept his distance this time because he knew what happened after james had hoisted severus into the air and taunted him he knew what had been done and said and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again he watched as lily joined the group and went to snapes defense distantly he heard snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury the unforgivable word mudblood 
 
 the scene changed 
 
 im sorry 
 
 im not interested 
 
 im sorry 
 
 save your breath 
 
 it was nighttime lily who was wearing a dressing gown stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the fat lady at the entrance to gryffindor tower 
 
 i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here 
 
 i was i would have done i never meant to call you mudblood it just c 
 
 slipped out there was no pity in lilys voice its too late ive made excuses for you for years none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you you and your precious little death eater friends c you see you dont even deny it you dont even deny thats what youre all aiming to be you cant wait to join can you 
 
 he opened his mouth but closed it without speaking 
 
 i cant pretend anymore youve chosen your way ive chosen mine 
 
 no c listen i didnt mean c 
 
 c to call me mudblood but you call everyone of my birth mudblood severus why should i be any different 
 
 he struggled on the verge of speech but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole 
 
 the corridor dissolved and the scene took a little longer to reform harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop forlorn and cold in the darkness the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees the adult snape was panting turning on the spot his wand gripped tightly in his hand waiting for something or for someone his fear infected harry too even though he knew that he could not be harmed and he looked over his shoulder wondering what it was that snape was waiting for c then a blinding jagged jet of white light flew through the air harry thought of lightning but snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand 
 
 dont kill me 
 
 that was not my intention 
 
 any sound of dumbledore apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches he stood before snape with his robes whipping around him and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand 
 
 well severus what message does lord voldemort have for me 
 
 no c no message c im here on my own account 
 
 snape was wringing his hands he looked a little mad with his straggling black hair flying around him 
 
 i c i come with a warning c no a request c please c 
 
 dumbledore flicked his wand though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and snape faced each other 
 
 what request could a death eater make of me 
 
 the c the prophecythe predictiontrelawney 
 
 ah yes said dumbledore how much did you relay to lord voldemort 
 
 everything c everything i heard said snape that is why c it is for that reason c he thinks it means lily evans 
 
 the prophecy did not refer to a woman said dumbledore it spoke of a boy born at the end of july c 
 
 you know what i mean he thinks it means her son he is going to hunt her down c kill them all c 
 
 if she means so much to you said dumbledore surely lord voldemort will spare her could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son 
 
 i have c i have asked him c 
 
 you disgust me said dumbledore and harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice snape seemed to shrink a little you do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child they can die as long as you have what you want 
 
 snape said nothing but merely looked up at dumbledore 
 
 hide them all then he croaked keep her c them c safe please 
 
 and what will you give me in return severus 
 
 in c in return snape gaped at dumbledore and harry expected him to protest but after a long moment he said anything 
 
 the hilltop faded and harry stood in dumbledores office and something was making a terrible sound like a wounded animal snape was slumped forward in a chair and dumbledore was standing over him looking grim after a moment or two snape raised his face and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop 
 
 i thoughtyou were goingto keep hersafe 
 
 she and james put their faith in the wrong person said dumbledore rather like you severus werent you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her 
 
 snapes breathing was shallow 
 
 her boy survives said dumbledore 
 
 with a tiny jerk of the head snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly 
 
 her son lives he has her eyes precisely her eyes you remember the shape and color of lily evanss eyes i am sure 
 
 dont bellowed snape gonedead 
 
 is this remorse severus 
 
 i wishi wish i were dead 
 
 and what use would that be to anyone said dumbledore coldly if you loved lily evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear 
 
 snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain and dumbledores words appeared to take a long time to reach him 
 
 what c what do you mean 
 
 you know how and why she died make sure it was not in vain help me protect lilys son 
 
 he does not need protection the dark lord has gone c 
 
 the dark lord will return and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does 
 
 there was a long pause and slowly snape regained control of himself mastered his own breathing at last he said very well very well but never c never tell dumbledore this must be between us swear it i cannot bearespecially potters soni want your word 
 
 my word severus that i shall never reveal the best of you dumbledore sighed looking down into snapes ferocious anguished face if you insist 
 
 the office dissolved but instantly snape was pacing up and down in front of dumbledore 
 
 c mediocre arrogant as his father a determined delighted to find himself famous and impertinent c 
 
 you see what you expect to see severus said dumbledore without raising his eyes from a copy of transfiguration today other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented personally i find him an engaging child 
 
 dumbledore turned a page and said without looking up keep an eye on quirrell wont you 
 
 a whirl of color and now everything darkened and snape and dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall while the last stragglers from the yule ball passed them on their way to bed 
 
 well murmured dumbledore 
 
 karkaroffs mark is becoming darker too he is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell snape looked sideways at dumbledores profile karkaroff intends to flee if the mark burns 
 
 does he said dumbledore softly as fleur delacour and roger davies came giggling in from the grounds and are you tempted to join him 
 
 no said snape his black eyes on fleurs and rogers retreating figures i am not such a coward 
 
 no agreed dumbledore you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff you know i sometimes think we sort too soon 
 
 he walked away leaving snape looking stricken 
 
 and now harry stood in the headmasters office yet again it was nighttime and dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk apparently semiconscious his right hand dangled over the side blackened and burned snape was muttering incantations pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down dumbledores throat after a moment or two dumbledores eyelids fluttered and opened 
 
 why said snape without preamble why did you put on that ring it carries a curse surely you realized that why even touch it 
 
 marvolo gaunts ring lay on the desk before dumbledore it was cracked the sword of gryffindor lay beside it 
 
 dumbledore grimaced 
 
 iwas a fool sorely tempted 
 
 tempted by what 
 
 dumbledore did not answer 
 
 it is a miracle you managed to return here snape sounded furious that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being c 
 
 dumbledore raised his blackened useless hand and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio 
 
 you have done very well severus how long do you think i have 
 
 dumbledores tone was conversational he might have been asking for a weather forecast snape hesitated and then said i cannot tell maybe a year there is no halting such a spell forever it will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time 
 
 dumbledore smiled the news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him 
 
 i am fortunate extremely fortunate that i have you severus 
 
 if you had only summoned me a little earlier i might have been able to do more buy you more time said snape furiously he looked down at the broken ring and the sword did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse 
 
 something like thati was delirious no doubt said dumbledore with an effort he straightened himself in his chair well really this makes matters much more straightforward 
 
 snape looked utterly perplexed dumbledore smiled 
 
 i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me 
 
 snape sat down in the chair harry had so often occupied across the desk from dumbledore harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of dumbledores cursed hand but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further scowling snape said the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed this is merely punishment for luciuss recent failures slow torture for dracos parents while they watch him fail and pay the price 
 
 in short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have said dumbledore now i should have thought the natural successor to the job once draco fails is yourself 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 that i think is the dark lords plan 
 
 lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at hogwarts 
 
 he believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes 
 
 and if it does fall into his grasp said dumbledore almost it seemed as an aside i have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at hogwarts 
 
 snape gave a stiff nod 
 
 good now then your first priority will be to discover what draco is up to a frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself offer him help and guidance he ought to accept he likes you c 
 
 c much less since his father has lost favor draco blames me he thinks i have usurped luciuss position 
 
 all the same try i am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from lord voldemorts wrath 
 
 snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked are you intending to let him kill you 
 
 certainly not you must kill me 
 
 there was a long silence broken only by an odd clicking noise fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone 
 
 would you like me to do it now asked snape his voice heavy with irony or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph 
 
 oh not quite yet said dumbledore smiling i daresay the moment will present itself in due course given what has happened tonight he indicated his withered hand we can be sure that it will happen within a year 
 
 if you dont mind dying said snape roughly why not let draco do it 
 
 that boys soul is not yet so damaged said dumbledore i would not have it ripped apart on my account 
 
 and my soul dumbledore mine 
 
 you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation said dumbledore i ask this one great favor of you severus because death is coming for me as surely as the chudley cannons will finish bottom of this years league i confess i should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance greyback is involved c i hear voldemort has recruited him or dear bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it 
 
 his tone was light but his blue eyes pierced snape as they had frequently pierced harry as though the soul they discussed was visible to him at last snape gave another curt nod 
 
 dumbledore seemed satisfied 
 
 thank you severus 
 
 the office disappeared and now snape and dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight 
 
 what are you doing with potter all these evenings you are closeted together snape asked abruptly 
 
 dumbledore looked weary 
 
 why you arent trying to give him more detentions severus the boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out 
 
 he is his father over again c 
 
 in looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers i spend time with harry because i have things to discuss with him information i must give him before it is too late 
 
 information repeated snape you trust himyou do not trust me 
 
 it is not a question of trust i have as we both know limited time it is essential that i give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do 
 
 and why may i not have the same information 
 
 i prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of lord voldemort 
 
 which i do on your orders 
 
 and you do it extremely well do not think that i underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself severus to give voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job i would entrust to nobody but you 
 
 yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the dark lords mind 
 
 voldemort fears that connection said dumbledore not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing harrys mind means to him it was pain such as he has never experienced he will not try to possess harry again i am sure of it not in that way 
 
 i dont understand 
 
 lord voldemorts soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like harrys like a tongue on frozen steel like flesh in flame c 
 
 souls we were talking of minds 
 
 in the case of harry and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other 
 
 dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone they were close by the forbidden forest now but there was no sign of anyone near them 
 
 after you have killed me severus c 
 
 you refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me snarled snape and real anger flared in the thin face now you take a great deal for granted dumbledore perhaps i have changed my mind 
 
 you gave me your word severus and while we are talking about services you owe me i thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young slytherin friend 
 
 snape looked angry mutinous dumbledore sighed 
 
 come to my office tonight severus at eleven and you shall not complain that i have no confidence in you 
 
 they were back in dumbledores office the windows dark and fawkes sat silent as snape sat quite still as dumbledore walked around him talking 
 
 harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done 
 
 but what must he do 
 
 that is between harry and me now listen closely severus there will come a time c after my death c do not argue do not interrupt there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake 
 
 for nagini snape looked astonished 
 
 precisely if there comes a time when lord voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then i think it will be safe to tell harry 
 
 tell him what 
 
 dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes 
 
 tell him that on the night lord voldemort tried to kill him when lily cast her own life between them as a shield the killing curse rebounded upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building part of lord voldemort lives inside harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with lord voldemorts mind that he has never understood and while that fragment of soul unmissed by voldemort remains attached to and protected by harry lord voldemort cannot die 
 
 harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voices echoing strangely in his ears 
 
 so the boythe boy must die asked snape quite calmly 
 
 and voldemort himself must do it severus that is essential 
 
 another long silence then snape said i thoughtall those yearsthat we were protecting him for her for lily 
 
 we have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength said dumbledore his eyes still tight shut meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth sometimes i have thought he suspects it himself if i know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of voldemort 
 
 dumbledore opened his eyes snape looked horrified 
 
 you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment 
 
 dont be shocked severus how many men and women have you watched die 
 
 lately only those whom i could not save said snape he stood up you have used me 
 
 meaning 
 
 i have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you everything was supposed to be to keep lily potters son safe now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter c 
 
 but this is touching severus said dumbledore seriously have you grown to care for the boy after all 
 
 for him shouted snape expecto patronum 
 
 from the tip of his wand burst the silver doe she landed on the office floor bounded once across the office and soared out of the window dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears 
 
 after all this time 
 
 always said snape 
 
 and the scene shifted now harry saw snape talking to the portrait of dumbledore behind his desk 
 
 you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harrys departure from his aunt and uncles said dumbledore not to do so will raise suspicion when voldemort believes you so well informed however you must plant the idea of decoys that i think ought to ensure harrys safety try confunding mundungus fletcher and severus if you are forced to take part in the chase be sure to act your part convincinglyi am counting upon you to remain in lord voldemorts good books as long as possible or hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the carrows 
 
 now snape was head to head with mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern mundunguss face looking curiously blank snape frowning in concentration 
 
 you will suggest to the order of the phoenix snape murmured that they use decoys polyjuice potion identical potters its the only thing that might work you will forget that i have suggested this you will present it as your own idea you understand 
 
 i understand murmured mundungus his eyes unfocused 
 
 now harry was flying alongside snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night he was accompanied by other hodded death eaters and ahead were lupin and a harry who was really george a death eater moved ahead of snape and raised his wand pointing it directly at lupins back 
 
 sectumsempra shouted snape 
 
 but the spell intended for the death eaters wand hand missed and hit george instead c 
 
 and next snape was kneeling in siriuss old bedroom tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from lily the second page carried only a few words could ever have been friends with gellert grindelwald i think her minds going personally 
 
 lots of love lily 
 
 snape took the page bearing lilys signature and her love and tucked it inside his robes then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding so that he kept the part from which lily laughed throwing the portion showing james and harry back onto the floor under the chest of drawers 
 
 and now snape stood again in the headmasters study as phineas nigellus came hurrying into his portrait 
 
 headmaster they are camping in the forest of dean the mudblood c 
 
 do not use that word 
 
 c the granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and i heard her 
 
 good very good cried the portrait of dumbledore behind the headmasters chair now severus the sword do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor c and he must not know that you give it if voldemort should read harrys mind and see you acting for him c 
 
 i know said snape curtly he approached the portrait of dumbledore and pulled at its side it swung forward revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of gryffindor 
 
 and you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give potter the sword said snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes 
 
 no i dont think so said dumbledores portrait he will know what to do with it and severus be very careful they may not take kindly to your appearance after george weasleys mishap c 
 
 snape turned at the door 
 
 dont worry dumbledore he said coolly i have a plan 
 
 and snape left the room harry rose up out of the pensieve and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms snape might just have closed the door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bell 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the narrow streets of a large town people often heard in the 
 evening when the sun was setting and his last rays gave a golden 
 tint to the a strange noise which resembled the sound of a church bell it only lasted an instant for it was lost in the 
 continual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose from the 
 town the evening bell is ringing people used to say the sun is 
 setting those who walked outside the town where the houses were 
 less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little fields saw the 
 evening sky much better and heard the sound of the bell much more 
 clearly it seemed as though the sound came from a church deep in the calm fragrant wood and thither people looked with devout feelings 
 
 a considerable time elapsed one said to the other i really 
 wonder if there is a church out in the wood the bell has indeed a 
 strange sweet sound shall we go there and see what the cause of it 
 is the rich drove the poor walked but the way seemed to them 
 extraordinarily long and when they arrived at a number of willow 
 trees on the border of the wood they sat down looked up into the 
 great branches and thought they were now really in the wood a 
 confectioner from the town also came out and put up a stall there 
 then came another confectioner who hung a bell over his stall which 
 was covered with pitch to protect it from the rain but the clapper 
 was wanting 
 
 when people came home they used to say that it had been very 
 romantic and that really means something else than merely taking tea 
 three persons declared that they had gone as far as the end of the 
 wood they had always heard the strange sound but there it seemed 
 to them as if it came from the town one of them wrote verses about 
 the bell and said that it was like the voice of a mother speaking 
 to an intelligent and beloved child no tune he said was sweeter 
 than the sound of the bell 
 
 the emperor of the country heard of it and declared that he who 
 would really find out where the sound came from should receive the 
 title of bellringer to the world even if there was no bell at all 
 now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendid 
 berth but only one of them came back with some sort of explanation 
 none of them had gone far enough nor had he and yet he said that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a hollow tree it was a 
 wisdom owl which continually knocked its head against the tree but 
 he was unable to say with certainty whether its head or the hollow 
 trunk of the tree was the cause of the noise 
 
 he was appointed bellringer to the world and wrote every year a 
 short dissertation on the owl but by this means people did not become any wiser than they had been before 
 
 it was just the clergyman had delivered a 
 beautiful and touching sermon the candidates were deeply moved by it it was indeed a very important day for them they were all at once 
 transformed from mere children to people the childish soul 
 was to fly over as it were into a more reasonable being 
 
 the sun shone most brightly and the sound of the great unknown 
 bell was heard more distinctly than ever they had a mind to go 
 thither all except three one of them wished to go home and try on 
 her ball dress for this very dress and the ball were the cause of her 
 being confirmed this time otherwise she would not have been allowed 
 to go the second a poor boy had borrowed a coat and a pair of boots from the son of his landlord to be confirmed in and he had to 
 return them at a certain time the third said that he never went 
 into strange places if his parents were not with him he had always 
 been a good child and wished to remain so even after being 
 confirmed and they ought not to tease him for this they however 
 did it all the same these three therefore did not go the others 
 went on the sun was shining the birds were singing and the 
 confirmed children sang too holding each other by the hand for 
 they had no position yet and they were all equal in the eyes of 
 god two of the smallest soon became tired and returned to the town two little girls sat down and made garlands of flowers they 
 therefore did not go on when the others arrived at the willow trees 
 where the confectioner had put up his stall they said now we are 
 out here the bell does not in reality exist it is only something 
 that people imagine 
 
 then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully and 
 solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to go 
 still further on the wood was very thickly grown it was difficult to 
 advance wood lilies and anemones grew almost too high flowering 
 convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to 
 tree while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played 
 that was very beautiful but the way was unfit for the girls they 
 would have torn their dresses large rocks covered with moss of 
 various hues were lying about the fresh spring water rippled forth 
 with a peculiar sound i think that can be the bell said 
 one of the confirmed children and then he lay down and listened 
 we must try to find out if it is and there he remained and let the 
 others walk on 
 
 they came to a hut built of the bark of trees and branches a 
 large tree spread its branches over it as if it intended 
 to pour all its fruit on the roof upon which roses were blooming the 
 long boughs covered the gable where a little bell was hanging was 
 this the one they had heard all agreed that it must be so except one 
 who said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard at 
 such a distance and that it had quite a different sound to that which 
 had so touched hearts 
 
 he who spoke was a son and therefore the others said 
 that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other people 
 therefore they let him go alone and as he walked on the solitude 
 of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast but still 
 he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced and 
 sometimes when the wind blew in that direction he could hear the 
 sounds from the stall where the others were singing at 
 tea but the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger soon it 
 seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment the sound came from the left from the side where the heart is now something rustled among the bushes and a little boy stood before the son in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach to his wrists they knew each other the boy was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to take the coat and boots back to his son that he had done and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes for the sound of the bell was too enticing he felt he must go on 
 
 we might go together said the son but the poor boy with 
 the wooden shoes was quite ashamed he pulled at the short sleeves 
 of his jacket and said that he was afraid he could not walk so 
 fast besides he was of opinion that the bell ought to be sought at 
 the right for there was all that was grand and magnificent 
 
 then we shall not meet said the son nodding to the poor 
 boy who went into the deepest part of the wood where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands face and feet until 
 they bled the son also received several good scratches but 
 the sun was shining on his way and it is he whom we will now 
 follow for he was a quick fellow i will and must find the bell he 
 said if i have to go to the end of the world 
 
 ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their teeth 
 shall we beat him they said shall we thrash him he is a 
 son 
 
 but he walked on undaunted deeper and deeper into the wood where 
 the most wonderful flowers were growing there were standing white 
 star lilies with stamens tulips shining when the 
 wind moved them covered with apples like large glittering 
 soap bubbles only think how resplendent these trees were in the 
 sunshine all around were beautiful green meadows where hart and hind played in the grass there grew magnificent oaks and and if the bark was split of any of them long blades of grass grew out of the clefts there were also large smooth lakes in the wood 
 on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings 
 the son often stood still and listened sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes but soon he found that this was a mistake and that the bell was 
 ringing still farther in the wood then the sun set the clouds were 
 as red as fire it became quiet in the wood he sank down on his 
 knees sang an evening hymn and said i shall never find what i am 
 looking for now the sun is setting and the night the dark night is 
 approaching yet i may perhaps see the round sun once more before he disappears beneath the horizon i will climb up these rocks they 
 are as high as the highest trees and then taking hold of the 
 creepers and roots he climbed up on the wet stones where 
 were wriggling and the toads as it were barked at 
 him he reached the top before the sun seen from such a height had 
 quite set oh what a splendour the sea the great majestic sea 
 which was rolling its long waves against the shore stretched out 
 before him and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and 
 there where sea and heaven met all melted together in the most 
 glowing colours the wood was singing and his heart too the whole of nature was one large holy church in which the trees and hovering 
 clouds formed the pillars the flowers and grass the woven velvet 
 carpet and heaven itself was the great cupola up there the flame 
 colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared but millions of 
 stars were lighted diamond lamps were shining and the son 
 stretched his arms out towards heaven towards the sea and towards 
 the wood then suddenly the poor boy with the jacket and the wooden shoes appeared he had arrived just as quickly on the 
 road he had chosen and they ran towards each other and took one 
 hand in the great cathedral of nature and poesy and 
 above them sounded the invisible holy bell happy spirits surrounded 
 them singing hallelujahs and rejoicing

 went on the sun was shining the birds were singing and the 
 confirmed children sang too holding each other by the hand for 
 they had no position yet and they were all equal in the eyes of 
 god two of the smallest soon became tired and returned to the town two little girls sat down and made garlands of flowers they 
 therefore did not go on when the others arrived at the willow trees 
 where the confectioner had put up his stall they said now we are 
 out here the bell does not in reality exist it is only something 
 that people imagine 
 
 then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully and 
 solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to go 
 still further on the wood was very thickly grown it was difficult to 
 advance wood lilies and anemones grew almost too high flowering 
 convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to 
 tree while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played 
 that was very beautiful but the way was unfit for the girls they 
 would have torn their dresses large rocks covered with moss of 
 various hues were lying about the fresh spring water rippled forth 
 with a peculiar sound i think that can be the bell said 
 one of the confirmed children and then he lay down and listened 
 we must try to find out if it is and there he remained and let the 
 others walk on 
 
 they came to a hut built of the bark of trees and branches a 
 large tree spread its branches over it as if it intended 
 to pour all its fruit on the roof upon which roses were blooming the 
 long boughs covered the gable where a little bell was hanging was 
 this the one they had heard all agreed that it must be so except one 
 who said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard at 
 such a distance and that it had quite a different sound to that which 
 had so touched hearts 
 
 he who spoke was a son and therefore the others said 
 that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other people 
 therefore they let him go alone and as he walked on the solitude 
 of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast but still 
 he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced and 
 sometimes when the wind blew in that direction he could hear the 
 sounds from the stall where the others were singing at 
 tea but the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger soon it 
 seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment the sound came from the left from the side where the heart is now something rustled among the bushes and a little boy stood before the son in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach to his wrists they knew each other the boy was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to take the coat and boots back to his son that he had done and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes for the sound of the bell was too enticing he felt he must go on 
 
 we might go together said the son but the poor boy with 
 the wooden shoes was quite ashamed he pulled at the short sleeves 
 of his jacket and said that he was afraid he could not walk so 
 fast besides he was of opinion that the bell ought to be sought at 
 the right for there was all that was grand and magnificent 
 
 then we shall not meet said the son nodding to the poor 
 boy who went into the deepest part of the wood where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands face and feet until 
 they bled the son also received several good scratches but 
 the sun was shining on his way and it is he whom we will now 
 follow for he was a quick fellow i will and must find the bell he 
 said if i have to go to the end of the world 
 
 ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their teeth 
 shall we beat him they said shall we thrash him he is a 
 son 
 
 but he walked on undaunted deeper and deeper into the wood where 
 the most wonderful flowers were growing there were standing white 
 star lilies with stamens tulips shining when the 
 wind moved them covered with apples like large glittering 
 soap bubbles only think how resplendent these trees were in the 
 sunshine all around were beautiful green meadows where hart and hind played in the grass there grew magnificent oaks and and if the bark was split of any of them long blades of grass grew out of the clefts there were also large smooth lakes in the wood 
 on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings 
 the son often stood still and listened sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes but soon he found that this was a mistake and that the bell was 
 ringing still farther in the wood then the sun set the clouds were 
 as red as fire it became quiet in the wood he sank down on his 
 knees sang an evening hymn and said i shall never find what i am 
 looking for now the sun is setting and the night the dark night is 
 approaching yet i may perhaps see the round sun once more before he disappears beneath the horizon i will climb up these rocks they 
 are as high as the highest trees and then taking hold of the 
 creepers and roots he climbed up on the wet stones where 
 were wriggling and the toads as it were barked at 
 him he reached the top before the sun seen from such a height had 
 quite set oh what a splendour the sea the great majestic sea 
 which was rolling its long waves against the shore stretched out 
 before him and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and 
 there where sea and heaven met all melted together in the most 
 glowing colours the wood was singing and his heart too the whole of nature was one large holy church in which the trees and hovering 
 clouds formed the pillars the flowers and grass the woven velvet 
 carpet and heaven itself was the great cupola up there the flame 
 colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared but millions of 
 stars were lighted diamond lamps were shining and the son 
 stretched his arms out towards heaven towards the sea and towards 
 the wood then suddenly the poor boy with the jacket and the wooden shoes appeared he had arrived just as quickly on the 
 road he had chosen and they ran towards each other and took one 
 hand in the great cathedral of nature and poesy and 
 above them sounded the invisible holy bell happy spirits surrounded 
 them singing hallelujahs and rejoicing

 he allowed marius to slide down upon the shore 
 they were in the open air 
 the miasmas darkness horror lay behind him 
 the pure healthful living joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him everywhere around him reigned silence but that charming silence when the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky 
 twilight had descended night was drawing on the great deliverer the friend of all those who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish the sky presented itself in all directions like an enormous calm the river flowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss 
 the aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night in the elms of the was audible 
 a few stars daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith and visible to revery alone formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity 
 evening was unfolding over the head of jean valjean all the sweetness of the infinite 
 it was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose oneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to permit of recognition at close quarters 
 for several seconds jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by that august and caressing serenity such moments of oblivion do come to men suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch everything is eclipsed in the thoughts peace broods over the dreamer like night and beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is illuminated the soul becomes studded with stars jean valjean could not refrain from contemplating that vast clear shadow which rested over him thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal heavens then he bent down swiftly to marius as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him and dipping up water in the hollow of his hand he gently sprinkled a few drops on the face marius eyelids did not open but his mouth still breathed 
 jean valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more when all at once he experienced an indescribable embarrassment such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does not see 
 we have already alluded to this impression with which everyone is familiar 
 he turned round 
 some one was in fact behind him as there had been a short while before 
 a man of lofty stature enveloped in a long coat with folded arms and bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was visible stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where jean valjean was crouching over marius 
 with the aid of the darkness it seemed a sort of apparition an ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight a thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon 
 jean valjean recognized javert 
 the reader has divined no doubt that pursuer was no other than javert 
 javert after his escape from the barricade had betaken himself to the prefecture of police had rendered a verbal account to the prefect in person in a brief audience had then immediately gone on duty again which implied the note the reader will recollect which had been captured on his certain surveillance of the shore on the right bank of the seine near the which had for some time past aroused the attention of the police 
 there he had caught sight of thenardier and had followed him 
 the reader knows the rest 
 thus it will be easily understood that that grating so obligingly opened to jean valjean was a bit of cleverness on part thenardier intuitively felt that javert was still there the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him it was necessary to fling a bone to that an assassin what a godsend 
 such an opportunity must never be allowed to slip 
 thenardier by putting jean valjean outside in his stead provided a prey for the police forced them to relinquish his scent made them forget him in a bigger adventure repaid javert for his waiting which always flatters a spy earned thirty francs and counted with certainty so far as he himself was concerned on escaping with the aid of this diversion 
 jean valjean had fallen from one danger upon another 
 these two encounters this falling one after the other from thenardier upon javert was a rude shock 
 javert did not recognize jean valjean who as we have stated no longer looked like himself 
 he did not unfold his arms he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist by an imperceptible movement and said in a curt calm voice 
 who are you 
 i 
 who is i 
 jean valjean 
 javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth bent his knees inclined his body laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of jean valjean which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices scrutinized him and recognized him 
 their faces almost touched look was terrible 
 jean valjean remained inert beneath grasp like a lion submitting to the claws of a lynx 
 inspector javert said he you have me in your power 
 moreover i have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning i did not give you my address with any intention of escaping from you take me 
 only grant me one favor 
 javert did not appear to hear him 
 he kept his eyes riveted on jean valjean 
 his chin being contracted thrust his lips upwards towards his nose a sign of savage revery 
 at length he released jean valjean straightened himself stiffly up without bending grasped his bludgeon again firmly and as though in a dream he murmured rather than uttered this question 
 what are you doing here 
 and who is this man 
 he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou 
 jean valjean replied and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse javert 
 it is with regard to him that i desire to speak to you dispose of me as you see fit but first help me to carry him home that is all that i ask of you 
 face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed to think him capable of making a concession 
 nevertheless he did not say no 
 again he bent over drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he moistened in the water and with which he then wiped marius brow 
 this man was at the barricade said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself 
 he is the one they called marius 
 a spy of the first quality who had observed everything listened to everything and taken in everything even when he thought that he was to die who had played the spy even in his agony and who with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre had taken notes 
 he seized marius hand and felt his pulse 
 he is wounded said jean valjean 
 he is a dead man said javert 
 jean valjean replied 
 no not yet 
 so you have brought him thither from the barricade remarked javert 
 his preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer and for him not to even notice jean silence after his question 
 jean valjean on his side seemed to have but one thought he resumed 
 he lives in the marais rue des with his grandfather 
 i do not recollect his name 
 jean valjean fumbled in marius coat pulled out his opened it at the page which marius had pencilled and held it out to javert 
 there was still sufficient light to admit of reading

 first epilogue 
 chapter iii 
 
 the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to moscow it was necessary that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east that they should abandon all established traditions and customs and that during their military movement they should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committed during that movement 
 and beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately large group was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done 
 a man without convictions without habits without traditions without a name and not even a frenchman emerges by what seem the strangest chances from among all the seething french parties and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position 
 the ignorance of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance of his opponents the frankness of his falsehoods and the dazzling and limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy his opponents reluctance to fight and his own childish audacity and secure him military fame innumerable so called chances accompany him everywhere the disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of france turns to his advantage his attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the russian service and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing during the war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner owing to various diplomatic considerations the russian armies just those which might have destroyed his prestige do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there 
 on his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed and by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to africa again chance accompanies him impregnable malta surrenders without a shot his most reckless schemes are crowned with success the fleet which subsequently did not let a single boat pass allows his entire army to elude it in africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants and the men who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselves that this is admirable this is glory it resembles caesar and alexander the great and is therefore good 
 this ideal of glory and grandeur which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significance that ideal destined to guide this man and his associates had scope for its development in africa whatever he does succeeds the plague does not touch him the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault his childishly rash and ignoble departure from africa leaving his comrades in distress is set down to his credit and again the fleet twice lets him slip past when intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully he reaches paris the dissolution of the republican government which a year earlier might have ruined him has reached its extreme limit and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him and though he himself has no plan he is quite ready for his new role 
 he had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation 
 he alone with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and egypt his insane his boldness in crime and frankness in lying he alone could justify what had to be done 
 he is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all his mistakes he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success 
 he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes to flee considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him but the once proud and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out are even more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power 
 chance millions of chances give him power and all men as if by agreement to confirm that power chance forms the characters of the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the character of paul i of russia who recognizes his government chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power chance puts the duc in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right since he had the might chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against england which would inevitably have ruined him he never carries out that intention but unexpectedly falls upon mack and the austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius give him the victory at austerlitz and by chance all men not only the french but all europe except england which does not take part in the events about to happen despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes now recognize his authority the title he has given himself and his ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent and reasonable to them all 
 as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement the western forces push toward the east several times in and gaining strength and growing in the group of people that had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central europe the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group during the preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him the king of prussia sends his wife to seek the great mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter the caesars into his bed the pope the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen there is no step no crime or petty fraud he commits which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed the most suitable fete the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt not only is he great but so are his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part and when he is ready so too are the forces 
 the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow that city is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire and the frosts and instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident 
 the invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him 
 a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of and precede the great westward movement there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesion of the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitation midway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached 
 paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chance occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and his craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later an outlawed brigand but by some strange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him

 he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes to flee considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him but the once proud and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out are even more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power 
 chance millions of chances give him power and all men as if by agreement to confirm that power chance forms the characters of the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the character of paul i of russia who recognizes his government chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power chance puts the duc in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right since he had the might chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against england which would inevitably have ruined him he never carries out that intention but unexpectedly falls upon mack and the austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius give him the victory at austerlitz and by chance all men not only the french but all europe except england which does not take part in the events about to happen despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes now recognize his authority the title he has given himself and his ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent and reasonable to them all 
 as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement the western forces push toward the east several times in and gaining strength and growing in the group of people that had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central europe the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group during the preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him the king of prussia sends his wife to seek the great mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter the caesars into his bed the pope the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen there is no step no crime or petty fraud he commits which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed the most suitable fete the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt not only is he great but so are his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part and when he is ready so too are the forces 
 the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow that city is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire and the frosts and instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident 
 the invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him 
 a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of and precede the great westward movement there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesion of the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitation midway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached 
 paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chance occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and his craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later an outlawed brigand but by some strange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him

 first epilogue 
 chapter v 
 
 wedding to bezukhov which took place in was the last happy event in the family of the old rostovs count ilya rostov died that same year and as always happens after the death the family group broke up 
 the events of the previous year the burning of moscow and the flight from it the death of prince andrew despair death and the old countess grief fell blow after blow on the old head he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising 
 the arrangements for marriage occupied him for a while he ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him 
 when pierre and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression a few days later he fell ill and took to his bed he realized from the first that he would not get up again despite the encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand on his last day sobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property that being the chief fault of which he was conscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly died and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs all these acquaintances who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him now said with a common feeling of and emotion as if justifying themselves well whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man you meet such men nowadays and which of us has not weaknesses of his own 
 it was just when the affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died 
 nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his death reached him he at once resigned his commission and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to moscow the state of the affairs became quite obvious a month after his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected the debts amounted to double the value of the property 
 friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his memory which he held sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts 
 the creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the careless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed to pity the old man the cause of their losses if they were losses now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them 
 not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold by auction for half its value and half the debts still remained unpaid nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as the creditors threatened he the government service 
 he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life and so despite his reluctant to remain in moscow among people who had known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil service he accepted a post in moscow in that service doffed the uniform of which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya to a small house on the sivtsev vrazhek 
 natasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from his nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and sonya but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty the countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it was for her son kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep to send for a friend now some expensive article of food for herself or wine for her son or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha or sonya or for nicholas himself 
 sonya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with her whims and secret and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from her 
 he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and because there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that people are valued for but little that could have made him love her he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed 
 nicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream not only did he not save anything but to comply with his demands he even incurred some small debts he could see no way out of this situation the idea of marrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his female relations was repugnant to him the other way out his death never entered his head he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently up and down the room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position

 the arrangements for marriage occupied him for a while he ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him 
 when pierre and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression a few days later he fell ill and took to his bed he realized from the first that he would not get up again despite the encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand on his last day sobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property that being the chief fault of which he was conscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly died and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs all these acquaintances who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him now said with a common feeling of and emotion as if justifying themselves well whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man you meet such men nowadays and which of us has not weaknesses of his own 
 it was just when the affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died 
 nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his death reached him he at once resigned his commission and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to moscow the state of the affairs became quite obvious a month after his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected the debts amounted to double the value of the property 
 friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his memory which he held sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts 
 the creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the careless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed to pity the old man the cause of their losses if they were losses now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them 
 not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold by auction for half its value and half the debts still remained unpaid nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as the creditors threatened he the government service 
 he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life and so despite his reluctant to remain in moscow among people who had known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil service he accepted a post in moscow in that service doffed the uniform of which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya to a small house on the sivtsev vrazhek 
 natasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from his nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and sonya but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty the countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it was for her son kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep to send for a friend now some expensive article of food for herself or wine for her son or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha or sonya or for nicholas himself 
 sonya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with her whims and secret and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from her 
 he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and because there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that people are valued for but little that could have made him love her he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed 
 nicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream not only did he not save anything but to comply with his demands he even incurred some small debts he could see no way out of this situation the idea of marrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his female relations was repugnant to him the other way out his death never entered his head he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently up and down the room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position

 the grandfather 
 basque and the porter had carried marius into the as he still lay stretched out motionless on the sofa upon which he had been placed on his arrival 
 the doctor who had been sent for had hastened thither 
 aunt gillenormand had risen 
 aunt gillenormand went and came in affright wringing her hands and incapable of doing anything but saying 
 heavens is it possible at times she added 
 everything will be covered with blood when her first horror had passed off a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated her mind and took form in the exclamation it was bound to end in this way 
 she did not go so far as i told you so which is customary on this sort of occasion at the orders a camp bed had been prepared beside the sofa the doctor examined marius and after having found that his pulse was still beating that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils he had him placed flat on the bed without a pillow with his head on the same level as his body and even a trifle lower and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration mademoiselle gillenormand on perceiving that they were undressing marius withdrew 
 she set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber 
 the trunk had not suffered any internal injury a bullet deadened by the had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideous laceration which was of no great depth and consequently not dangerous 
 the long underground journey had completed the dislocation of the broken and the disorder there was serious 
 the arms had been slashed with sabre cuts not a single scar disfigured his face but his head was fairly covered with cuts what would be the result of these wounds on the head would they stop short at the hairy cuticle or would they attack the brain 
 as yet this could not be decided 
 a grave symptom was that they had caused a swoon and that people do not always recover from such swoons 
 moreover the wounded man had been exhausted by hemorrhage 
 from the waist down the barricade had protected the lower part of the body from injury 
 basque and nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages nicolette sewed them basque rolled them 
 as lint was lacking the doctor for the time being arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding beside the bed three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out 
 the doctor bathed marius face and hair with cold water 
 a full pail was reddened in an instant the porter candle in hand lighted them 
 the doctor seemed to be pondering sadly 
 from time to time he made a negative sign with his head as though replying to some question which he had inwardly addressed to himself 
 a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor with himself 
 at the moment when the doctor was wiping marius face and lightly touching his still closed eyes with his finger a door opened at the end of the and a long pallid figure made its appearance 
 this was the grandfather 
 the revolt had for the past two days deeply agitated enraged and engrossed the mind of m gillenormand 
 he had not been able to sleep on the previous night and he had been in a fever all day long in the evening he had gone to bed very early recommending that everything in the house should be well barred and he had fallen into a doze through sheer fatigue 
 old men sleep lightly m chamber adjoined the and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken the noise had awakened him 
 surprised at the rift of light which he saw under his door he had risen from his bed and had groped his way thither 
 he stood astonished on the threshold one hand on the handle of the door with his head bent a little forward and quivering his body wrapped in a white which was straight and as destitute of folds as a and he had the air of a phantom who is gazing into a tomb 
 he saw the bed and on the mattress that young man bleeding white with a waxen whiteness with closed eyes and gaping mouth and pallid lips stripped to the waist slashed all over with crimson wounds motionless and brilliantly lighted up 
 the grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbs can tremble his eyes whose corneae were yellow on account of his great age were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter his whole face assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull his arms fell pendent as though a spring had broken and his amazement was betrayed by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands which quivered all over his knees formed an angle in front allowing through the opening in his a view of his poor bare legs all bristling with white hairs and he murmured 
 marius 
 sir said basque monsieur has just been brought back he went to the barricade and 
 he is dead cried the old man in a terrible voice 
 ah 
 the rascal 
 then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this centenarian as erect as a young man 
 sir said he you are the doctor 
 begin by telling me one thing he is dead is he not 
 the doctor who was at the highest pitch of anxiety remained silent 
 m gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter 
 he is dead 
 he is dead 
 he is dead 
 he has got himself killed on the barricades 
 out of hatred to me 
 he did that to spite me 
 ah 
 you this is the way he returns to me misery of my life he is dead 
 he went to the window threw it wide open as though he were stifling and erect before the darkness he began to talk into the street to the night 
 pierced sabred exterminated slashed hacked in pieces 
 just look at that the villain 
 he knew well that i was waiting for him and that i had had his room arranged and that i had placed at the head of my bed his portrait taken when he was a little child he knew well that he had only to come back and that i had been recalling him for years and that i remained by my fireside with my hands on my knees not knowing what to do and that i was mad over it 
 you knew well that you had but to return and to say it is i and you would have been the master of the house and that i should have obeyed you and that you could have done whatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather you knew that well and you said 
 no he is a royalist i will not go 
 and you went to the barricades and you got yourself killed out of malice 
 to revenge yourself for what i said to you about monsieur le duc de berry it is infamous 
 go to bed then and sleep tranquilly he is dead and this is my awakening 
 the doctor who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters quitted marius for a moment went to m gillenormand and took his arm the grandfather turned round gazed at him with eyes which seemed exaggerated in size and bloodshot and said to him calmly 
 i thank you sir 
 i am composed i am a man i witnessed the death of louis xvi i know how to bear events 
 one thing is terrible and that is to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief you will have scribblers chatterers lawyers orators tribunes discussions progress enlightenment the rights of man the liberty of the press and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you 
 ah 
 marius 
 it is abominable 
 killed 
 dead before me a barricade 
 ah the scamp 
 doctor you live in this quarter i believe 
 oh 
 i know you well 
 i see your cabriolet pass my window 
 i am going to tell you 
 you are wrong to think that i am angry 
 one does not fly into a rage against a dead man that would be stupid 
 this is a child whom i have reared i was already old while he was very young 
 he played in the tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair and in order that the inspectors might not grumble i stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel with my cane one day he exclaimed 
 down with louis xviii and off he went it was no fault of mine 
 he was all rosy and blond 
 his mother is dead 
 have you ever noticed that all little children are blond why is it so 
 he is the son of one of those brigands of the loire but children are innocent of their fathers crimes 
 i remember when he was no higher than that 
 he could not manage to pronounce his ds he had a way of talking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping 
 i remember that once in front of the hercules farnese people formed a circle to admire him and marvel at him he was so handsome was that child he had a head such as you see in pictures 
 i talked in a deep voice and i frightened him with my cane but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh 
 in the morning when he entered my room i grumbled but he was like the sunlight to me all the same one cannot defend oneself against those brats 
 they take hold of you they hold you fast they never let you go again 
 the truth is that there never was a cupid like that child 
 now what can you say for your lafayettes your benjamin constants and your tirecuir de corcelles who have killed him 
 this cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion 
 he approached marius who still lay livid and motionless and to whom the physician had returned and began once more to wring his hands 
 the old pallid lips moved as though mechanically and permitted the passage of words that were barely audible like breaths in the death agony 
 ah heartless lad 
 ah clubbist 
 ah wretch 
 ah 
 septembrist 
 reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man addressed to a corpse 
 little by little as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions should come to the light the sequence of words returned but the grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them his voice was so weak and extinct that it seemed to come from the other side of an abyss 
 it is all the same to me i am going to die too that i am and to think that there is not a hussy in paris who would not have been delighted to make this wretch happy 
 a scamp who instead of amusing himself and enjoying life went off to fight and get himself shot down like a brute 
 and for whom 
 why 
 for the republic instead of going to dance at the chaumiere as it is the duty of young folks to do 
 the use of being twenty years old 
 the republic a cursed pretty folly 
 poor mothers beget fine boys do 
 come he is dead 
 that will make two funerals under the same carriage gate so you have got yourself arranged like this for the sake of general handsome eyes 
 what had that general lamarque done to you a slasher 
 a to get oneself killed for a dead man if that enough to drive any one mad 
 just think of it at twenty 
 and without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him 
 the way poor good old fellows are forced to die alone perish in your corner owl 
 well after all so much the better that is what i was hoping for this will kill me on the spot 
 i am too old i am a hundred years old i am a hundred thousand years old i ought by rights to have been dead long ago 
 this blow puts an end to it so all is over what happiness 
 what is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs 
 you are wasting your trouble you fool of a doctor 
 come dead completely dead i know all about it i am dead myself too 
 he done things by half 
 yes this age is infamous infamous and what i think of you of your ideas of your systems of your masters of your oracles of your doctors of your of writers of your rascally philosophers and of all the revolutions which for the last sixty years have been frightening the flocks of crows in the tuileries 
 but you were pitiless in getting yourself killed like this i shall not even grieve over your death do you understand you assassin 
 at that moment marius slowly opened his eyes and his glance still dimmed by lethargic wonder rested on m gillenormand 
 marius cried the old man 
 marius 
 my little marius my child my son 
 you open your eyes you gaze upon me you are alive thanks 
 and he fell fainting

 first epilogue 
 chapter vi 
 
 at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated and how the son has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were saying 
 i never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herself feeling a joyous sense of her love for him remembering her friendly relations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of the family she thought it her duty to go to see them but remembering her relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in moscow 
 nicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only be reached through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiff proud expression she had not seen on it before he inquired about her health led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutes left the room 
 when the princess came out of the countess room nicholas met her again and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom to her remarks about his health he made no reply that to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to say 
 why does she come prowling here what does she want i bear these ladies and all these civilities said he aloud in presence evidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriage had disappeared 
 oh nicholas how can you talk like that cried sonya hardly able to conceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her 
 nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day 
 she sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expressed a wish to see her often but yet always became when she began to talk about her 
 nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess but his silence irritated her 
 she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and you must go and call on her you would at least be seeing somebody and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us 
 but i in the least want to mamma 
 you used to want to and now you really i understand you my dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see anyone 
 but i never said i was dull 
 why you said yourself you want even to see her she is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head you hide everything from me 
 not at all mamma 
 if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only ask you to return a call one would think mere politeness required it well i have asked you and now i interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother 
 well then go if you wish it 
 it matter to me i only wish it for your sake 
 nicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for a patience trying to divert his attention to another topic 
 the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and the day after that 
 after her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by nicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call 
 i expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to her aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations 
 but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and when she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was her relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not express his feeling for her she knew that but it concealed something and until she could discover what that something was she felt that she could not be at ease 
 one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her lessons she was informed that rostov had called with a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sent for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room 
 her first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her

 first epilogue 
 chapter vi 
 
 at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated and how the son has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were saying 
 i never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herself feeling a joyous sense of her love for him remembering her friendly relations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of the family she thought it her duty to go to see them but remembering her relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in moscow 
 nicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only be reached through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiff proud expression she had not seen on it before he inquired about her health led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutes left the room 
 when the princess came out of the countess room nicholas met her again and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom to her remarks about his health he made no reply that to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to say 
 why does she come prowling here what does she want i bear these ladies and all these civilities said he aloud in presence evidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriage had disappeared 
 oh nicholas how can you talk like that cried sonya hardly able to conceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her 
 nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day 
 she sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expressed a wish to see her often but yet always became when she began to talk about her 
 nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess but his silence irritated her 
 she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and you must go and call on her you would at least be seeing somebody and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us 
 but i in the least want to mamma 
 you used to want to and now you really i understand you my dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see anyone 
 but i never said i was dull 
 why you said yourself you want even to see her she is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head you hide everything from me 
 not at all mamma 
 if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only ask you to return a call one would think mere politeness required it well i have asked you and now i interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother 
 well then go if you wish it 
 it matter to me i only wish it for your sake 
 nicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for a patience trying to divert his attention to another topic 
 the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and the day after that 
 after her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by nicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call 
 i expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to her aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations 
 but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and when she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was her relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not express his feeling for her she knew that but it concealed something and until she could discover what that something was she felt that she could not be at ease 
 one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her lessons she was informed that rostov had called with a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sent for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room 
 her first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her 
 they spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of the latest war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise nicholas got up to say 
 with mademoiselle help the princess had maintained the conversation very well but at the very last moment just when he rose she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life that in a fit of she sat still her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that he had risen

 book derailed 
 chapter i 
 
 javert passed slowly down the rue de arme 
 he walked with drooping head for the first time in his life and likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his back 
 up to that day javert had borrowed from attitudes only that which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest that which is expressive of the hands behind the been unknown to him 
 now a change had taken place his whole person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety 
 he plunged into the silent streets 
 nevertheless he followed one given direction 
 he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quai des ormes skirted the quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from the post of the place du chatelet at the angle of the pont there between the and the pont au change on the one hand and the quai de la megisserie and the quai aux fleurs on the other the seine forms a sort of square lake traversed by a rapid 
 this point of the seine is dreaded by mariners 
 nothing is more dangerous than this rapid hemmed in at that epoch and irritated by the piles of the mill on the bridge now demolished the two bridges situated thus close together augment the peril the water hurries in formidable wise through the arches 
 it rolls in vast and terrible waves it accumulates and piles up there the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes 
 men who fall in there never the best of swimmers are drowned there 
 javert leaned both elbows on the parapet his chin resting in both hands and while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of his whiskers he meditated 
 a novelty a revolution a catastrophe had just taken place in the depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself 
 javert was undergoing horrible suffering 
 for several hours javert had ceased to be simple 
 he was troubled that brain so limpid in its blindness had lost its transparency that crystal was clouded 
 javert felt duty divided within his conscience and he could not conceal the fact from himself 
 when he had so unexpectedly encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine there had been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey and of the dog who finds his master again 
 he beheld before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known more than one straight line 
 and the poignant anguish lay in this that the two paths were contrary to each other one of these straight lines excluded the other 
 which of the two was the true one 
 his situation was indescribable 
 to owe his life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repay it to be in spite of himself on a level with a fugitive from justice and to repay his service with another service to allow it to be said to him go and to say to the latter in his turn 
 be free to sacrifice to personal motives duty that general obligation and to be conscious in those personal motives of something that was also general and perchance superior to betray society in order to remain true to his conscience that all these absurdities should be realized and should accumulate upon was what overwhelmed him 
 one thing had amazed was that jean valjean should have done him a favor and one thing petrified him that he javert should have done jean valjean a favor 
 where did he stand 
 he sought to comprehend his position and could no longer find his bearings 
 what was he to do now 
 to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean valjean at liberty was bad 
 in the first case the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys in the second a convict rose above the law and set his foot upon it 
 in both cases dishonor for him javert 
 there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive 
 destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice javert had reached one of those extremities 
 one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think the very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it thought was something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful 
 in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion and it irritated him to have that within him 
 thought on any subject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue thought on the day which had just passed was a torture 
 nevertheless it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after such shocks and render to himself an account of himself 
 what he had just done made him shudder 
 he javert had seen fit to decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the whole social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code upon a release this had suited him he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable every time that he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which he had committed he trembled from head to foot upon what should he decide 
 one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to the rue de arme and commit jean valjean to prison 
 it was clear that that was what he ought to do he could not 
 something barred his way in that direction 
 something 
 what 
 is there in the world anything outside of the tribunals executory sentences the police and the authorities javert was overwhelmed 
 a sacred 
 a convict who could not be touched by the law and that the deed of javert 
 was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the man made to proceed with vigor the man made to these two men who were both the things of the law should have come to such a pass that both of them had set themselves above the law 
 what then such enormities were to happen and no one was to be punished 
 jean valjean stronger than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he javert was to go on eating the bread 
 his revery gradually became terrible 
 he might athwart this revery have also reproached himself on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue des but he never even thought of that the lesser fault was lost in the greater 
 besides that insurgent was obviously a dead man and legally death puts an end to pursuit 
 jean valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit 
 jean valjean disconcerted him 
 all the axioms which had served him as points of support all his life long had crumbled away in the presence of this man 
 jean generosity towards him javert crushed him 
 other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities 
 m madeleine behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed in such fashion that they now formed but one which was venerable 
 javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his for a convict respect for a that a possible thing 
 he shuddered at it yet could not escape from it 
 in vain did he struggle he was reduced to confess in his inmost heart the sublimity of that wretch 
 this was odious 
 a benevolent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement a convict returning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy saving him who had smitten him kneeling on the heights of virtue more nearly akin to an angel than to a man javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed 
 things could not go on in this manner 
 certainly and we insist upon this point he had not yielded without resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous hero who enraged almost as much as he amazed him twenty times as he sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had roared within him 
 a score of times he had been tempted to fling himself upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to arrest him 
 what more simple in fact 
 to cry out at the first post that they is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban to summon the gendarmes and say to them 
 this man is yours then to go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter 
 this man is forever a prisoner of the law the law may do with him what it will 
 what could be more just javert had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to apprehend the man and then as at present he had not been able to do it and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towards jean collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice a strange voice crying to is well deliver up your savior 
 then have the basin of pontius pilate brought and wash your claws 
 then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he beheld himself javert degraded 
 a convict was his benefactor 
 but then why had he permitted that man to leave him alive he had the right to be killed in that barricade 
 he should have asserted that right 
 it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force 
 his supreme anguish was the loss of certainty 
 he felt that he had been uprooted 
 the code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand 
 he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species there had taken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto 
 to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice a whole order of unexpected facts had cropped up and subjugated him a whole new world was dawning on his soul 
 kindness accepted and repaid devotion mercy indulgence violences committed by pity on austerity respect for persons no more definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a tear in the eye of the law no one knows what justice according to god running in inverse sense to justice according to men 
 he perceived amid the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun it horrified and dazzled him an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle 
 he said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled obedience that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue of the functionary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified against a surprise 
 he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist 
 this convict had been good 
 and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been good also 
 so he was becoming depraved 
 he found that he was a coward 
 he conceived a horror of himself 
 ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was to be irreproachable 
 now he had just failed in this 
 how had he come to such a pass 
 how had all this happened he could not have told himself 
 he clasped his head in both hands but in spite of all that he could do he could not contrive to explain it to himself 
 he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which he javert was the slave 
 not for a single instant while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of releasing him 
 it was in some sort without his consciousness that his hand had relaxed and had let him go free 
 all sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes 
 he put questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies frightened him 
 he asked himself 
 what has that convict done that desperate fellow whom i have pursued even to persecution and who has had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me my life in showing mercy upon me 
 his duty 
 no something more and i in showing mercy upon him in my have i done my duty 
 no something more 
 so there is something beyond duty here he took fright his balance became disjointed one of the scales fell into the abyss the other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below 
 without being in the least in the world what is called voltairian or a philosopher or incredulous being on the contrary respectful by instinct towards the established church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole order was his dogma and sufficed for him ever since he had attained to estate and the rank of a functionary he had centred nearly all his religion in the police 
 here we employ words without the least irony and in their most serious acceptation being as we have said a spy as other men are priests 
 he had a superior m gisquet up to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior god 
 this new chief god he became unexpectedly conscious of and he felt embarrassed by him 
 this unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings he did not know what to do with this superior he who was not ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow that he must not disobey nor find fault nor discuss and that in the presence of a superior who amazes him too greatly the inferior has no other resource than that of handing in his resignation 
 but how was he to set about handing in his resignation to god 
 however things might it was to this point that he reverted fact dominated everything else for him and that was that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law 
 he had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban 
 he had just set a at large he had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them that was what he had done 
 he no longer understood himself the very reasons for his action escaped him only their vertigo was left with him 
 up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity engenders 
 this faith had quitted him this probity had deserted him 
 all that he had believed in melted away 
 truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably 
 henceforth he must be a different man he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract 
 he saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold 
 he felt himself emptied useless put out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved 
 authority was dead within him 
 he had no longer any reason for existing 
 a terrible situation to be touched 
 to be granite and to doubt to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart to come to the pass of returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil to be the and to lick the hand to be ice and melt to be the pincers and to turn into a hand to suddenly feel fingers opening to relax a terrible thing 
 the no longer acquainted with his route and retreating 
 to be obliged to confess this to oneself 
 infallibility is not infallible there may exist error in the dogma all has not been said when a code speaks society is not perfect authority is complicated with vacillation a crack is possible in the immutable judges are but men the law may err tribunals may make a mistake to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament 
 that which was passing in javert was the fampoux of a rectilinear conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probity which had been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking against god 
 it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that the engineer of authority mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light that the immovable the direct the correct the geometrical the passive the perfect could bend that there should exist for the locomotive a road to damascus 
 god always within man and refractory he the true conscience to the false a prohibition to the spark to die out an order to the ray to remember the sun an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute humanity which cannot be lost the human heart indestructible that splendid phenomenon the finest perhaps of all our interior marvels did javert understand this 
 did javert penetrate it did javert account for it to himself 
 evidently he did not but beneath the pressure of that incontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting 
 he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy in all this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence it seemed to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever he was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head 
 up to this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing incomprehensible nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided for authority was a plane surface there was no fall in it no dizziness in its presence 
 javert had never beheld the unknown except from below 
 the irregular the unforeseen the disordered opening of chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches 
 now javert threw himself back and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition 
 a gulf on high 
 what one was dismantled from top to bottom one was disconcerted absolutely 
 in what could one trust 
 that which had been agreed upon was giving way 
 what the defect in armor could be discovered by a magnanimous wretch 
 what an honest servitor of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to escape and the crime of arresting him everything was not settled in the orders given by the state to the functionary 
 there might be blind alleys in duty 
 what all this was real was it true that an weighed down with convictions could rise erect and end by being in the right was this credible were there cases in which the law should retire before transfigured crime and stammer its that was the state of the case and javert saw it and javert had touched it and not only could he not deny it but he had taken part in it these were realities 
 it was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity 
 if facts did their duty they would confine themselves to being proofs of the law is god who sends them was anarchy then on the point of now descending from on high 
 in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced and society and the human race and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and terrible the penal laws the thing judged the force due to legislation the decrees of the sovereign courts the magistracy the government prevention repression official cruelty wisdom legal infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all this was rubbish a shapeless mass chaos he himself javert the spy of order incorruptibility in the service of the police the providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect at the summit of all that ruin a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had come this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul 
 was this to be endured 
 no 
 a violent state if ever such existed 
 there were only two ways of escaping from it 
 one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys 
 the other 
 javert quitted the parapet and with head erect this time betook himself with a firm tread towards the indicated by a lantern at one of the corners of the place du chatelet 
 on arriving there he saw through the window a sergeant of police and he entered 
 policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they open the door of a javert mentioned his name showed his card to the sergeant and seated himself at the table of the post on which a candle was burning 
 on a table lay a pen a leaden inkstand and paper provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the night patrols 
 this table still completed by its chair is an institution it exists in all police stations it is invariably ornamented with a saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers and it forms the lowest stage of official style it is there that the literature of the state has its beginning 
 javert took a pen and a sheet of paper and began to write this is what he wrote 
 a few observations for the good of the service 
 in the first place 
 i beg monsieur le prefet to cast his eyes on this 
 secondly 
 prisoners on arriving after examination take off their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being searched 
 many of them cough on their return to prison this entails hospital expenses 
 thirdly 
 the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other so that in case one agent should for any cause grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take his place 
 fourthly 
 it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair even by paying for it 
 fifthly 
 in the madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand 
 sixthly 
 the prisoners called barkers who summon the other prisoners to the parlor force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly 
 this is a theft 
 seventhly 
 for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving shop this is an abuse of the contractor since the cloth is none the worse for it 
 eighthly 
 it is annoying for visitors to la force to be obliged to traverse the boys court in order to reach the parlor of 
 ninthly 
 it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating in the of the prefecture the interrogations put by the magistrates to prisoners 
 for a gendarme who should be sworn to secrecy to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder 
 tenthly 
 mme henry is an honest woman her canteen is very neat but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the of the secret cells 
 this is unworthy of the conciergerie of a great civilization 
 javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography not omitting a single comma and making the paper screech under his pen below the last line he 
 inspector of the st class 
 the post of the place du chatelet june th about one in the morning 
 javert dried the fresh ink on the paper folded it like a letter sealed it wrote on the back 
 note for the administration left it on the table and quitted the post 
 the glazed and grated door fell to behind him 
 again he traversed the place du chatelet diagonally regained the quay and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had abandoned a quarter of an hour previously leaned on his elbows and found himself again in the same attitude on the same of the parapet 
 he did not appear to have stirred 
 the darkness was complete 
 it was the sepulchral moment which follows midnight 
 a ceiling of clouds concealed the stars 
 not a single light burned in the houses of the city no one was passing all of the streets and quays which could be seen were deserted and the towers of the seemed features of the night 
 a street lantern reddened the margin of the quay the outlines of the bridges lay shapeless in the mist one behind the other 
 recent rains had swollen the river 
 the spot where javert was leaning was it will be remembered situated precisely over the rapids of the seine perpendicularly above that formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again like an endless screw 
 javert bent his head and gazed 
 all was black 
 nothing was to be distinguished 
 a sound of foam was audible but the river could not be seen 
 at moments in that dizzy depth a gleam of light appeared and undulated vaguely water possessing the power of taking light no one knows whence and converting it into a snake 
 the light vanished and all became indistinct once more 
 immensity seemed thrown open there 
 what lay below was not water it was a gulf the wall of the quay abrupt confused mingled with the vapors instantly concealed from sight produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite 
 nothing was to be seen but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt a fierce breath rose from this abyss 
 the flood in the river divined rather than perceived the tragic whispering of the waves the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge the imaginable fall into that gloomy void into all that shadow was full of horror

 chapter i 
 
 javert passed slowly down the rue de arme 
 he walked with drooping head for the first time in his life and likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his back 
 up to that day javert had borrowed from attitudes only that which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest that which is expressive of the hands behind the been unknown to him 
 now a change had taken place his whole person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety 
 he plunged into the silent streets 
 nevertheless he followed one given direction 
 he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quai des ormes skirted the quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from the post of the place du chatelet at the angle of the pont there between the and the pont au change on the one hand and the quai de la megisserie and the quai aux fleurs on the other the seine forms a sort of square lake traversed by a rapid 
 this point of the seine is dreaded by mariners 
 nothing is more dangerous than this rapid hemmed in at that epoch and irritated by the piles of the mill on the bridge now demolished the two bridges situated thus close together augment the peril the water hurries in formidable wise through the arches 
 it rolls in vast and terrible waves it accumulates and piles up there the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes 
 men who fall in there never the best of swimmers are drowned there 
 javert leaned both elbows on the parapet his chin resting in both hands and while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of his whiskers he meditated 
 a novelty a revolution a catastrophe had just taken place in the depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself 
 javert was undergoing horrible suffering 
 for several hours javert had ceased to be simple 
 he was troubled that brain so limpid in its blindness had lost its transparency that crystal was clouded 
 javert felt duty divided within his conscience and he could not conceal the fact from himself 
 when he had so unexpectedly encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine there had been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey and of the dog who finds his master again 
 he beheld before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known more than one straight line 
 and the poignant anguish lay in this that the two paths were contrary to each other one of these straight lines excluded the other 
 which of the two was the true one 
 his situation was indescribable 
 to owe his life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repay it to be in spite of himself on a level with a fugitive from justice and to repay his service with another service to allow it to be said to him go and to say to the latter in his turn 
 be free to sacrifice to personal motives duty that general obligation and to be conscious in those personal motives of something that was also general and perchance superior to betray society in order to remain true to his conscience that all these absurdities should be realized and should accumulate upon was what overwhelmed him 
 one thing had amazed was that jean valjean should have done him a favor and one thing petrified him that he javert should have done jean valjean a favor 
 where did he stand 
 he sought to comprehend his position and could no longer find his bearings 
 what was he to do now 
 to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean valjean at liberty was bad 
 in the first case the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys in the second a convict rose above the law and set his foot upon it 
 in both cases dishonor for him javert 
 there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive 
 destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice javert had reached one of those extremities 
 one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think the very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it thought was something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful 
 in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion and it irritated him to have that within him 
 thought on any subject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue thought on the day which had just passed was a torture 
 nevertheless it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after such shocks and render to himself an account of himself 
 what he had just done made him shudder 
 he javert had seen fit to decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the whole social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code upon a release this had suited him he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable every time that he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which he had committed he trembled from head to foot upon what should he decide 
 one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to the rue de arme and commit jean valjean to prison 
 it was clear that that was what he ought to do he could not 
 something barred his way in that direction 
 something 
 what 
 is there in the world anything outside of the tribunals executory sentences the police and the authorities javert was overwhelmed 
 a sacred 
 a convict who could not be touched by the law and that the deed of javert 
 was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the man made to proceed with vigor the man made to these two men who were both the things of the law should have come to such a pass that both of them had set themselves above the law 
 what then such enormities were to happen and no one was to be punished 
 jean valjean stronger than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he javert was to go on eating the bread 
 his revery gradually became terrible 
 he might athwart this revery have also reproached himself on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue des but he never even thought of that the lesser fault was lost in the greater 
 besides that insurgent was obviously a dead man and legally death puts an end to pursuit 
 jean valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit 
 jean valjean disconcerted him 
 all the axioms which had served him as points of support all his life long had crumbled away in the presence of this man 
 jean generosity towards him javert crushed him 
 other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities 
 m madeleine behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed in such fashion that they now formed but one which was venerable 
 javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his for a convict respect for a that a possible thing 
 he shuddered at it yet could not escape from it 
 in vain did he struggle he was reduced to confess in his inmost heart the sublimity of that wretch 
 this was odious 
 a benevolent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement a convict returning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy saving him who had smitten him kneeling on the heights of virtue more nearly akin to an angel than to a man javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed 
 things could not go on in this manner 
 certainly and we insist upon this point he had not yielded without resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous hero who enraged almost as much as he amazed him twenty times as he sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had roared within him 
 a score of times he had been tempted to fling himself upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to arrest him 
 what more simple in fact 
 to cry out at the first post that they is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban to summon the gendarmes and say to them 
 this man is yours then to go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter 
 this man is forever a prisoner of the law the law may do with him what it will 
 what could be more just javert had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to apprehend the man and then as at present he had not been able to do it and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towards jean collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice a strange voice crying to is well deliver up your savior 
 then have the basin of pontius pilate brought and wash your claws 
 then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he beheld himself javert degraded 
 a convict was his benefactor 
 but then why had he permitted that man to leave him alive he had the right to be killed in that barricade 
 he should have asserted that right 
 it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force 
 his supreme anguish was the loss of certainty 
 he felt that he had been uprooted 
 the code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand 
 he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species there had taken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto 
 to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice a whole order of unexpected facts had cropped up and subjugated him a whole new world was dawning on his soul 
 kindness accepted and repaid devotion mercy indulgence violences committed by pity on austerity respect for persons no more definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a tear in the eye of the law no one knows what justice according to god running in inverse sense to justice according to men 
 he perceived amid the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun it horrified and dazzled him an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle 
 he said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled obedience that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue of the functionary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified against a surprise 
 he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist 
 this convict had been good 
 and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been good also 
 so he was becoming depraved 
 he found that he was a coward 
 he conceived a horror of himself 
 ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was to be irreproachable 
 now he had just failed in this 
 how had he come to such a pass 
 how had all this happened he could not have told himself 
 he clasped his head in both hands but in spite of all that he could do he could not contrive to explain it to himself 
 he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which he javert was the slave 
 not for a single instant while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of releasing him 
 it was in some sort without his consciousness that his hand had relaxed and had let him go free 
 all sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes 
 he put questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies frightened him 
 he asked himself 
 what has that convict done that desperate fellow whom i have pursued even to persecution and who has had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me my life in showing mercy upon me 
 his duty 
 no something more and i in showing mercy upon him in my have i done my duty 
 no something more 
 so there is something beyond duty here he took fright his balance became disjointed one of the scales fell into the abyss the other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below 
 without being in the least in the world what is called voltairian or a philosopher or incredulous being on the contrary respectful by instinct towards the established church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole order was his dogma and sufficed for him ever since he had attained to estate and the rank of a functionary he had centred nearly all his religion in the police 
 here we employ words without the least irony and in their most serious acceptation being as we have said a spy as other men are priests 
 he had a superior m gisquet up to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior god 
 this new chief god he became unexpectedly conscious of and he felt embarrassed by him 
 this unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings he did not know what to do with this superior he who was not ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow that he must not disobey nor find fault nor discuss and that in the presence of a superior who amazes him too greatly the inferior has no other resource than that of handing in his resignation 
 but how was he to set about handing in his resignation to god 
 however things might it was to this point that he reverted fact dominated everything else for him and that was that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law 
 he had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban 
 he had just set a at large he had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them that was what he had done 
 he no longer understood himself the very reasons for his action escaped him only their vertigo was left with him 
 up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity engenders 
 this faith had quitted him this probity had deserted him 
 all that he had believed in melted away 
 truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably 
 henceforth he must be a different man he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract 
 he saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold 
 he felt himself emptied useless put out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved 
 authority was dead within him 
 he had no longer any reason for existing 
 a terrible situation to be touched 
 to be granite and to doubt to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart to come to the pass of returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil to be the and to lick the hand to be ice and melt to be the pincers and to turn into a hand to suddenly feel fingers opening to relax a terrible thing 
 the no longer acquainted with his route and retreating 
 to be obliged to confess this to oneself 
 infallibility is not infallible there may exist error in the dogma all has not been said when a code speaks society is not perfect authority is complicated with vacillation a crack is possible in the immutable judges are but men the law may err tribunals may make a mistake to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament 
 that which was passing in javert was the fampoux of a rectilinear conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probity which had been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking against god 
 it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that the engineer of authority mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light that the immovable the direct the correct the geometrical the passive the perfect could bend that there should exist for the locomotive a road to damascus 
 god always within man and refractory he the true conscience to the false a prohibition to the spark to die out an order to the ray to remember the sun an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute humanity which cannot be lost the human heart indestructible that splendid phenomenon the finest perhaps of all our interior marvels did javert understand this 
 did javert penetrate it did javert account for it to himself 
 evidently he did not but beneath the pressure of that incontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting 
 he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy in all this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence it seemed to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever he was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head 
 up to this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing incomprehensible nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided for authority was a plane surface there was no fall in it no dizziness in its presence 
 javert had never beheld the unknown except from below 
 the irregular the unforeseen the disordered opening of chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches 
 now javert threw himself back and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition 
 a gulf on high 
 what one was dismantled from top to bottom one was disconcerted absolutely 
 in what could one trust 
 that which had been agreed upon was giving way 
 what the defect in armor could be discovered by a magnanimous wretch 
 what an honest servitor of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to escape and the crime of arresting him everything was not settled in the orders given by the state to the functionary 
 there might be blind alleys in duty 
 what all this was real was it true that an weighed down with convictions could rise erect and end by being in the right was this credible were there cases in which the law should retire before transfigured crime and stammer its that was the state of the case and javert saw it and javert had touched it and not only could he not deny it but he had taken part in it these were realities 
 it was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity 
 if facts did their duty they would confine themselves to being proofs of the law is god who sends them was anarchy then on the point of now descending from on high 
 in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced and society and the human race and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and terrible the penal laws the thing judged the force due to legislation the decrees of the sovereign courts the magistracy the government prevention repression official cruelty wisdom legal infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all this was rubbish a shapeless mass chaos he himself javert the spy of order incorruptibility in the service of the police the providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect at the summit of all that ruin a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had come this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul 
 was this to be endured 
 no 
 a violent state if ever such existed 
 there were only two ways of escaping from it 
 one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys 
 the other 
 javert quitted the parapet and with head erect this time betook himself with a firm tread towards the indicated by a lantern at one of the corners of the place du chatelet 
 on arriving there he saw through the window a sergeant of police and he entered 
 policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they open the door of a javert mentioned his name showed his card to the sergeant and seated himself at the table of the post on which a candle was burning 
 on a table lay a pen a leaden inkstand and paper provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the night patrols 
 this table still completed by its chair is an institution it exists in all police stations it is invariably ornamented with a saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers and it forms the lowest stage of official style it is there that the literature of the state has its beginning 
 javert took a pen and a sheet of paper and began to write this is what he wrote 
 a few observations for the good of the service 
 in the first place 
 i beg monsieur le prefet to cast his eyes on this 
 secondly 
 prisoners on arriving after examination take off their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being searched 
 many of them cough on their return to prison this entails hospital expenses 
 thirdly 
 the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other so that in case one agent should for any cause grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take his place 
 fourthly 
 it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair even by paying for it 
 fifthly 
 in the madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand 
 sixthly 
 the prisoners called barkers who summon the other prisoners to the parlor force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly 
 this is a theft 
 seventhly 
 for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving shop this is an abuse of the contractor since the cloth is none the worse for it 
 eighthly 
 it is annoying for visitors to la force to be obliged to traverse the boys court in order to reach the parlor of 
 ninthly 
 it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating in the of the prefecture the interrogations put by the magistrates to prisoners 
 for a gendarme who should be sworn to secrecy to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder 
 tenthly 
 mme henry is an honest woman her canteen is very neat but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the of the secret cells 
 this is unworthy of the conciergerie of a great civilization 
 javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography not omitting a single comma and making the paper screech under his pen below the last line he 
 inspector of the st class 
 the post of the place du chatelet june th about one in the morning 
 javert dried the fresh ink on the paper folded it like a letter sealed it wrote on the back 
 note for the administration left it on the table and quitted the post 
 the glazed and grated door fell to behind him 
 again he traversed the place du chatelet diagonally regained the quay and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had abandoned a quarter of an hour previously leaned on his elbows and found himself again in the same attitude on the same of the parapet 
 he did not appear to have stirred 
 the darkness was complete 
 it was the sepulchral moment which follows midnight 
 a ceiling of clouds concealed the stars 
 not a single light burned in the houses of the city no one was passing all of the streets and quays which could be seen were deserted and the towers of the seemed features of the night 
 a street lantern reddened the margin of the quay the outlines of the bridges lay shapeless in the mist one behind the other 
 recent rains had swollen the river 
 the spot where javert was leaning was it will be remembered situated precisely over the rapids of the seine perpendicularly above that formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again like an endless screw 
 javert bent his head and gazed 
 all was black 
 nothing was to be distinguished 
 a sound of foam was audible but the river could not be seen 
 at moments in that dizzy depth a gleam of light appeared and undulated vaguely water possessing the power of taking light no one knows whence and converting it into a snake 
 the light vanished and all became indistinct once more 
 immensity seemed thrown open there 
 what lay below was not water it was a gulf the wall of the quay abrupt confused mingled with the vapors instantly concealed from sight produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite 
 nothing was to be seen but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt a fierce breath rose from this abyss 
 the flood in the river divined rather than perceived the tragic whispering of the waves the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge the imaginable fall into that gloomy void into all that shadow was full of horror 
 javert remained motionless for several minutes gazing at this opening of shadow he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled attention 
 the water roared 
 all at once he took off his hat and placed it on the edge of the quay 
 a moment later a tall black figure which a belated in the distance might have taken for a phantom appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay bent over towards the seine then drew itself up again and fell straight down into the shadows a dull splash followed and the shadow alone was in the secret of the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath the water

 chapter vii 
 
 in the winter of nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald hills with his wife his mother and sonya 
 within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his property and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as well 
 in another three years by he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiating to buy back otradnoe that being his pet dream 
 having started farming from necessity he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas was a plain farmer he did not like innovations especially the english ones then coming into vogue he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management disliked factories the raising of expensive products and the buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate he always had before his eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it the chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygen in the air nor manures nor special plows but that most important agent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made effective the peasant laborer when nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches it was the serf who especially attracted his attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watched the serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods their manner of speech and their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the peasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language to grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform toward them the duties demanded of him and nicholas management produced very brilliant results 
 guided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder and delegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose and these posts never changed hands before analyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit and credit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alike on the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelled from the commune 
 he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and corn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well or got so good a return as did nicholas 
 he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the drones as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity when a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if one had to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions 
 he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to make things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclined to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind 
 often speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he would say what can one do with our russian peasants and imagined that he could not bear them 
 yet he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his whole soul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results 
 countess mary was jealous of this passion of her and regretted that she could not share it but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and peasant matthew ermishin who with his family had carted corn all night or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say well one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under cover 
 still less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately refuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed 
 sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least it never entered my head and i do that for their good all poetry and old wives talk all that doing good to neighbor what i want is that our children should not have to go begging i must put our affairs in order while i am alive all and to do that order and strictness are essential all about it said he clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he can do no good either for himself or for me 
 and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a master the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he was not to be trifled with either in a word he was a real master

 countess mary was jealous of this passion of her and regretted that she could not share it but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and peasant matthew ermishin who with his family had carted corn all night or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say well one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under cover 
 still less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately refuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed 
 sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least it never entered my head and i do that for their good all poetry and old wives talk all that doing good to neighbor what i want is that our children should not have to go begging i must put our affairs in order while i am alive all and to do that order and strictness are essential all about it said he clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he can do no good either for himself or for me 
 and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a master the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he was not to be trifled with either in a word he was a real master

 sieur boulatruelle was that of montfermeil whom the reader has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book 
 boulatruelle as the reader may perchance recall was a man who was occupied with divers and troublesome matters 
 he broke stones and damaged travellers on the highway 
 and thief as he was he cherished one dream he believed in the treasures buried in the forest of montfermeil 
 he hoped some day to find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree in the meanwhile he lived to search the pockets of 
 nevertheless for an instant he was prudent 
 he had just escaped neatly 
 he had been as the reader is aware picked up in garret in company with the other ruffians utility of a vice 
 his drunkenness had been his salvation the authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had been robbed an order of nolle prosequi founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush had set him at liberty he had taken to his heels 
 he had returned to his road from gagny to lagny to make under administrative supervision broken stone for the good of the state with downcast mien in a very pensive mood his ardor for theft somewhat cooled but he was addicted none the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him 
 as for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after his return to his cot here it is 
 one morning boulatruelle while on his way as was his wont to his work and possibly also to his ambush a little before daybreak caught sight through the branches of the trees of a man whose back alone he saw but the shape of whose shoulders as it seemed to him at that distance and in the early dusk was not entirely unfamiliar to him 
 boulatruelle although intoxicated had a correct and lucid memory a defensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflict with legal order

 chapter viii 
 
 one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed 
 once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo a man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the porch to question him and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard on returning to lunch nicholas went up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder countess mary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply 
 such an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mere recollection of him if he had told me he was drunk and did not see but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked 
 countess mary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered 
 why whatever is the matter my dearest 
 the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tears she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow or pity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm 
 the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry 
 nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas and she covered her face with her hands 
 nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and paced up and down the room he understood what she was weeping about but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it just sentimentality old wives tales or is she right he asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself 
 mary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again i give you my word never he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness 
 the tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes she took his hand and kissed it 
 nicholas when when did you break your cameo she asked to change the subject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of head 
 today it was the same affair oh mary remind me of it and again he flushed i give you my word of honor it occur again and let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the broken ring 
 after that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry but he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife and would again promise that this should really be the very last time 
 mary you must despise me he would say i deserve it 
 you should go go away at once if you feel strong enough to control yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband 
 among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the whole summer from spring sowing to harvest he was busy with the work on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business like seriousness leaving home for a month or even two with his hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading the books he read were chiefly historical and on these he spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he said a serious library and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought he would sit in his study with a grave air reading a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters in winter except for business excursions he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his relations with their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her 
 from the time of his marriage sonya had lived in his house before that nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and sonya blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done sonya felt herself to blame toward her and imagined that her wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not find fault with sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her but often felt toward her which she could not overcome 
 once she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about her own injustice toward her 
 you know said natasha you have read the gospels a great deal there is a passage in them that just fits sonya

 though countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel must be understood differently yet looking at sonya she agreed with explanation it really seemed that sonya did not feel her position trying and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole like a cat she had attached herself not to the people but to the home she waited on the old countess petted and spoiled the children was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude

 book and grandfather 
 chapter ii 
 
 marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic war 
 for a long time marius was neither dead nor alive 
 for many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by the wounds themselves 
 he repeated name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity of fever and with the sombre obstinacy of agony 
 the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become and consequently to kill the sick man under certain atmospheric conditions at every change of weather at the slightest storm the physician was uneasy 
 above all things he repeated let the wounded man be subjected to no emotion 
 the dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been invented as yet at that epoch nicolette used up a sheet as big as the ceiling as she put it for lint 
 it was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene as long as there was any danger m gillenormand seated in despair at his pillow was like marius neither alive nor dead 
 every day sometimes twice a day a very well dressed gentleman with white was the description given by the porter came to inquire about the wounded man and left a large package of lint for the dressings 
 finally on the th of september four months to a day after the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius 
 convalescence began 
 but marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched out on a long chair on account of the results called up by the fracture of his there always is a last wound like that which will not close and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely to the great annoyance of the sick person 
 however this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from all pursuit 
 in france there is no wrath not even of a public character which six months will not extinguish 
 revolts in the present state of society are so much the fault of every one that they are followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes 
 let us add that the inexcusable gisquet order which enjoined doctors to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the councils of war did not dare to trouble any one so marius was left in peace 
 m gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish and then through every form of ecstasy 
 it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man he had his big carried to marius bedside he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages mademoiselle gillenormand like a sage and elderly person contrived to spare the fine linen while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed 
 m gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him that for the preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen nor new linen as old linen 
 he was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which mademoiselle gillenormand modestly absented herself when the dead flesh was cut away with scissors he said 
 aie aie nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle senile palsy offer the wounded man a cup of his he overwhelmed the doctor with questions 
 he did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over again 
 on the day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of danger the good man was in a delirium 
 he made his porter a present of three louis 
 that evening on his return to his own chamber he danced a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the following est nee a fougere amour tu vis en elle 
 vrai nid bergere 
 car dans sa prunelle 
 son tu mets ton carquois 
 fripon 
 narquois 
 moi je la chante et plus que diane meme jeanne et ses durs tetons bretons jeanne was born at fougere a true nest i adore her petticoat the rogue 
 love thou dwellest in her for tis in her eyes that thou placest thy quiver sly scamp 
 as for me i sing her and i love more than diana herself jeanne and her firm breton breasts 
 then he knelt upon a chair and basque who was watching him through the door made sure that he was praying 
 up to that time he had not believed in god 
 at each succeeding phase of improvement which became more and more pronounced the grandfather raved 
 he executed a multitude of mechanical actions full of joy he ascended and descended the stairs without knowing why 
 a pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a big bouquet it was m gillenormand who had sent it to her 
 the husband made a jealous scene 
 m gillenormand tried to draw nicolette upon his knees

 book and grandfather 
 chapter ii 
 
 marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic war 
 for a long time marius was neither dead nor alive 
 for many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by the wounds themselves 
 he repeated name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity of fever and with the sombre obstinacy of agony 
 the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become and consequently to kill the sick man under certain atmospheric conditions at every change of weather at the slightest storm the physician was uneasy 
 above all things he repeated let the wounded man be subjected to no emotion 
 the dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been invented as yet at that epoch nicolette used up a sheet as big as the ceiling as she put it for lint 
 it was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene as long as there was any danger m gillenormand seated in despair at his pillow was like marius neither alive nor dead 
 every day sometimes twice a day a very well dressed gentleman with white was the description given by the porter came to inquire about the wounded man and left a large package of lint for the dressings 
 finally on the th of september four months to a day after the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius 
 convalescence began 
 but marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched out on a long chair on account of the results called up by the fracture of his there always is a last wound like that which will not close and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely to the great annoyance of the sick person 
 however this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from all pursuit 
 in france there is no wrath not even of a public character which six months will not extinguish 
 revolts in the present state of society are so much the fault of every one that they are followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes 
 let us add that the inexcusable gisquet order which enjoined doctors to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the councils of war did not dare to trouble any one so marius was left in peace 
 m gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish and then through every form of ecstasy 
 it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man he had his big carried to marius bedside he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages mademoiselle gillenormand like a sage and elderly person contrived to spare the fine linen while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed 
 m gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him that for the preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen nor new linen as old linen 
 he was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which mademoiselle gillenormand modestly absented herself when the dead flesh was cut away with scissors he said 
 aie aie nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle senile palsy offer the wounded man a cup of his he overwhelmed the doctor with questions 
 he did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over again 
 on the day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of danger the good man was in a delirium 
 he made his porter a present of three louis 
 that evening on his return to his own chamber he danced a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the following est nee a fougere amour tu vis en elle 
 vrai nid bergere 
 car dans sa prunelle 
 son tu mets ton carquois 
 fripon 
 narquois 
 moi je la chante et plus que diane meme jeanne et ses durs tetons bretons jeanne was born at fougere a true nest i adore her petticoat the rogue 
 love thou dwellest in her for tis in her eyes that thou placest thy quiver sly scamp 
 as for me i sing her and i love more than diana herself jeanne and her firm breton breasts 
 then he knelt upon a chair and basque who was watching him through the door made sure that he was praying 
 up to that time he had not believed in god 
 at each succeeding phase of improvement which became more and more pronounced the grandfather raved 
 he executed a multitude of mechanical actions full of joy he ascended and descended the stairs without knowing why 
 a pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a big bouquet it was m gillenormand who had sent it to her 
 the husband made a jealous scene 
 m gillenormand tried to draw nicolette upon his knees 
 he called marius m le baron he shouted 
 long live the republic 
 every moment he kept asking the doctor 
 is he no longer in danger he gazed upon marius with the eyes of a grandmother 
 he brooded over him while he ate 
 he no longer knew himself he no longer rendered himself an account of himself 
 marius was the master of the house there was abdication in his joy he was the grandson of his grandson

 first epilogue 
 chapter ix 
 
 it was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december natasha had been staying at her with her husband and children since early autumn pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute 
 besides the bezukhov family nicholas old friend the retired general vasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth of december 
 on the sixth which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for a tail coat and put on narrow boots with pointed toes and drive to the new church he had built and then receive visitors who would come to congratulate him offer them refreshments and talk about the elections of the nobility but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way he examined the accounts of the village in ryazan which belonged to his nephew wrote two business letters and walked over to the granaries cattle yards and stables before dinner having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great day he returned to dinner and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons at which the whole household had assembled at that table were his mother his old lady companion belova his wife their three children with their governess and tutor his nephew with his tutor sonya denisov natasha her three children their governess and old michael ivanovich the late architect who was living on in retirement at bald hills 
 countess mary sat at the other end of the table when her husband took his place she concluded from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him that he was out of humor as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm especially before the soup countess mary well knew that mood of his and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason and she felt unhappy she asked him where he had been he replied she again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily 
 then not mistaken thought countess mary why is he cross with me she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation she knew her remarks sounded unnatural but could not refrain from asking some more questions 
 thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general and lively and she did not talk to her husband when they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess countess mary held out her hand and kissed her husband and asked him why he was angry with her 
 you always have such strange fancies i even think of being angry he replied 
 but the word always seemed to her to imply yes i am angry but i tell you why 
 nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya and the old countess who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree could find nothing to reproach them with but even they had their moments of antagonism occasionally and it was always just after they had been happiest together they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility which occurred most frequently during countess pregnancies and this was such a time 
 well messieurs et mesdames said nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to vex her i have been on my feet since six this morning tomorrow i shall have to suffer so today go and rest 
 and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa 
 always the way thought countess mary he talks to everyone except me i see i see that i am repulsive to him especially when i am in this condition she looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale sallow emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever 
 and everything annoyed her shouting and laughter talk and especially a quick glance sonya gave her 
 sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling irritated 
 having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying she softly left the room and went to the nursery 
 the children were playing at going to moscow in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them she sat down and played with them a little but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her she got up and walking on tiptoe with difficulty went to the small sitting room 
 perhaps he is not asleep have an explanation with him she said to herself little andrew her eldest boy imitating his mother followed her on tiptoe she not notice him 
 mary dear i think he is asleep he was so tired said sonya meeting her in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that she crossed her path everywhere andrew may wake him 
 countess mary looked round saw little andrew following her felt that sonya was right and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh she made no reply but to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door sonya went away by another door from the room in which nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead his mustache and his whole face as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat and at that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door papa standing here countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy he grew silent and quiet ensued for a moment terrible to countess mary she knew how nicholas disliked being waked then through the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring and his voice said crossly 
 i get a peace mary is that you why did you bring him here 
 i only came in to look and did not notice forgive me 
 nicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery five minutes later little natasha her pet having learned from her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room ran to her father unobserved by her mother the little girl boldly opened the creaking door went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs and having examined the position of her father who was asleep with his back to her rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face 
 natasha natasha came countess frightened whisper from the door papa wants to sleep 
 no mamma he want to sleep said little natasha with conviction laughing 
 nicholas lowered his legs rose and took his daughter in his arms 
 come in mary he said to his wife 
 she went in and sat down by her husband 
 i did not notice him following me she said timidly i just looked in 
 holding his little girl with one arm nicholas glanced at his wife and seeing her guilty expression put his other arm around her and kissed her hair 
 may i kiss mamma he asked natasha 
 natasha smiled bashfully 
 again she commanded pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where nicholas had placed the kiss 
 i know why you think i am cross said nicholas replying to the question he knew was in his mind 
 you have no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are like that it always seems to me 
 mary talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he said gaily 
 it seems to be that you love me that i am so plain always and now in this cond 
 oh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears love that makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty but do i love my wife i love her but i know how to put it without you or when something comes between us like this i seem lost and do anything now do i love my finger i love it but just try to cut it off 
 not like that myself but i understand so not angry with me 
 awfully angry he said smiling and getting up and smoothing his hair he began to pace the room 
 do you know mary what been thinking he began immediately thinking aloud in his presence now that they had made it up 
 he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he told her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring 
 countess mary listened till he had finished made some remark and in her turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were about the children 
 you can see the woman in her already she said in french pointing to little natasha you reproach us women with being illogical here is our logic i say papa wants to sleep but she says no laughing and she was right said countess mary with a happy smile 
 yes yes and nicholas taking his little daughter in his strong hand lifted her high placed her on his shoulder held her by the legs and paced the room with her there was an expression of carefree happiness on the faces of both father and daughter 
 but you know you may be unfair you are too fond of this one his wife whispered in french 
 yes but what am i to do i try not to show 
 at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in the hall and anteroom as if someone had arrived 
 somebody has come 
 i am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary and left the room 
 in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a gallop round the room out of breath he took the laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart his capers reminded him of dancing and looking at the round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was an old man taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had danced daniel cooper with his daughter 
 it is he it is he nicholas said countess mary the room a few minutes later now our natasha has come to life you should have seen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so long well come along now quick quick time you two were parted she added looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father 
 nicholas went out holding the child by the hand 
 countess mary remained in the sitting room 
 i should never never have believed that one could be so happy she whispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt through her happiness that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant

 i should never never have believed that one could be so happy she whispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt through her happiness that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant

 first epilogue 
 chapter x 
 
 natasha had married in the early spring of and in already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing she had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively natasha of former days her features were more defined and had a calm soft and serene expression in her face there was none of the animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm now her face and body were of all that one saw and her soul was not visible at all all that struck the eye was a strong handsome and fertile woman the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now that happened only when as was the case that day her husband returned home or a sick child was convalescent or when she and countess mary spoke of prince andrew she never mentioned him to her husband who she imagined was jealous of prince memory or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage at the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days 
 since their marriage natasha and her husband had lived in moscow in petersburg on their estate near moscow or with her mother that is to say in nicholas house the young countess bezukhova was not often seen in society and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable not that natasha liked solitude she did not know whether she liked it or not she even thought that she did not but with her pregnancies her confinements the nursing of her children and sharing every moment of her life she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society all who had known natasha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband as she herself had once exclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood natasha and she kept saying that she had always known that natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother 
 only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurd 
 natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk especially by the french which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries should not neglect her accomplishments should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part she gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive she took no pains with her manners or with of speech or with her toilet or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting she acted in contradiction to all those rules she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely that is with her whole soul leaving no corner of it hidden from him she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her but by something else indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul 
 to fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable she did not know but she had no time at all for it the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dress or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things 
 we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if entire attention is devoted to it 
 the subject which wholly engrossed attention was her family that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear bring into the world nurse and bring up 
 and the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her whole soul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary 
 there were then as now conversations and discussions about rights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha she positively did not understand them 
 these questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that is only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance which lies in the family 
 discussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from dinner did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the family 
 if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinners 
 if the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that case will not have a family 
 if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family that is one wife or one husband natasha needed a husband a husband was given her and he gave her a family and she not only saw no need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different 
 natasha did not care for society in general but prized the more the society of her relatives countess mary and her brother her mother and sonya she valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on napkin and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better 
 to such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair her words and her jealousy she was jealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plain were habitual subjects of jest to those about her the general opinion was that pierre was under his thumb which was really true from the very first days of their married life natasha had announced her demands pierre was greatly surprised by his view to him a perfectly novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family his demands astonished him but they also flattered him and he submitted to them 
 subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman did not dare dine at the club as a pastime did not dare spend money a whim and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on business in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance to make up for this at home pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied that is was reading or writing in his study pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it 
 the entire household was governed according to supposed orders that is by his wishes which natasha tried to guess their way of life and place of residence their acquaintances and ties occupations the upbringing were all selected not merely with regard to expressed wishes but to what natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be and she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons 
 thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nurse three times and natasha fell ill from despair pierre one day told her of view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful when her next baby was born despite the opposition of her mother the doctors and even of her husband himself who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself a thing then unheard of and considered injurious she insisted on having her own way and after that nursed all her babies herself 
 it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute but long afterwards pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion 
 after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife all that was not quite good was rejected and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection

 book and grandfather 
 chapter iv 
 
 mademoiselle gillenormand ends by no longer thinking it a bad thing that m fauchelevent should have entered with something under his arm 
 cosette and marius beheld each other once more 
 what that interview was like we decline to say 
 there are things which one must not attempt to depict the sun is one of them 
 the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in marius chamber at the moment when cosette entered it 
 precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and gazing over it at cosette 
 she appeared on the threshold it seemed to him that she was surrounded by a glory 
 adorable he exclaimed 
 then he blew his nose noisily 
 cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven she was as thoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness she stammered all pale yet flushed she wanted to fling herself into marius arms and dared not 
 ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people 
 people are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone 
 lovers have no need of any people whatever 
 with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile it was monsieur fauchelevent it was jean valjean 
 he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely in black in perfectly new garments and with a white cravat 
 the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct bourgeois in this probable notary the bearer of the corpse who had sprung up at his door on the night of the th of june tattered muddy hideous haggard his face masked in blood and mire supporting in his arms the fainting marius still his scent was aroused 
 when m fauchelevent arrived with cosette the porter had not been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside 
 i know why it is but i help fancying that seen that face before 
 m fauchelevent in marius chamber remained apart near the door he had under his arm a package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume enveloped in paper 
 the enveloping paper was of a greenish hue and appeared to be mouldy 
 does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm mademoiselle gillenormand who did not like books demanded in a low tone of nicolette 
 well retorted m gillenormand who had overheard her in the same tone a learned man 
 what then 
 is that his fault monsieur boulard one of my acquaintances never walked out without a book under his arm either and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that 
 and with a bow he said aloud 
 monsieur tranchelevent 
 
 father gillenormand did not do it intentionally but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his 
 monsieur tranchelevent i have the honor of asking you on behalf of my grandson baron marius pontmercy for the hand of mademoiselle 
 monsieur tranchelevent bowed 
 settled said the grandfather 
 and turning to marius and cosette with both arms extended in blessing he cried 
 permission to adore each other 
 they did not require him to repeat it twice 
 so much the worse the chirping began 
 they talked low 
 marius resting on his elbow on his reclining chair cosette standing beside him 
 oh heavens murmured cosette i see you once again it is thou it is you the idea of going and fighting like that 
 but why 
 it is horrible i have been dead for four months 
 oh how wicked it was of you to go to that battle 
 what had i done to you 
 i pardon you but you will never do it again 
 a little while ago when they came to tell us to come to you i still thought that i was about to die but it was from joy 
 i was so sad 
 i have not taken the time to dress myself i must frighten people with my looks what will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar do speak 
 you let me do all the talking 
 we are still in the rue de arme 
 it seems that your shoulder was terrible they told me that you could put your fist in it 
 and then it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors 
 that is frightful i have cried till i have no eyes left 
 it is queer that a person can suffer like that 
 your grandfather has a very kindly air disturb yourself rise on your elbow you will injure yourself 
 oh how happy i am 
 so our unhappiness is over i am quite foolish 
 i had things to say to you and i no longer know in the least what they were 
 do you still love me 
 we live in the rue de arme 
 there is no garden 
 i made lint all the time stay sir look it is your fault i have a callous on my fingers 
 angel said marius 
 angel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out no other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it 
 then as there were spectators they paused and said not a word more contenting themselves with softly touching each hands 
 m gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried 
 talk loud the rest of you 
 make a noise you people behind the scenes 
 come a little uproar the deuce so that the children can chatter at their ease 
 and approaching marius and cosette he said to them in a very low voice 
 call each other thou 
 stand on ceremony 
 aunt gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light in her elderly household 
 there was nothing aggressive about this amazement it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and envious glance of an owl at two it was the stupid eye of a poor innocent seven and fifty years of age it was a life which had been a failure gazing at that triumph love 
 mademoiselle gillenormand senior said her father to her i told you that this is what would happen to you 
 he remained silent for a moment and then added 
 look at the happiness of others 
 then he turned to cosette 
 how pretty she is how pretty she is 
 a greuze so you are going to have that all to yourself you scamp ah my rogue you are getting off nicely with me you are happy if i were not fifteen years too old we would fight with swords to see which of us should have her 
 come now 
 i am in love with you mademoiselle 
 perfectly simple 
 it is your right you are in the right 
 ah what a sweet charming little wedding this will make 
 our parish is du saint sacrament but i will get a dispensation so that you can be married at the church is better 
 it was built by the jesuits it is more coquettish 
 it is opposite the fountain of cardinal de birague 
 the masterpiece of jesuit architecture is at namur it is called you must go there after you are married it is worth the journey 
 mademoiselle i am quite of your mind i think girls ought to marry that is what they are made for there is a certain whom i should always like to see uncoiffed a fine thing to remain a spinster but it is chilly 
 the bible says 
 multiply 
 in order to save the people jeanne is needed but in order to make people what is needed is mother goose 
 so marry my beauties 
 i really do not see the use in remaining a spinster 
 i know that they have their chapel apart in the church and that they fall back on the society of the virgin but sapristi a handsome husband a fine fellow and at the expiration of a year a big blond brat who nurses lustily and who has fine rolls of fat on his thighs and who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy paws laughing the while like the better than holding a candle at vespers and chanting turris eburnea 
 in allusion to the expression coiffer to remain unmarried 
 the grandfather executed a pirouette on his heels and began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more ainsi bornant les cours de tes revasseries alcippe il est donc vrai dans peu tu te maries 
 thus hemming in the course of thy musings alcippus it is true that thou wilt wed ere long 
 by the way 
 what is it father 
 have not you an intimate friend 
 yes courfeyrac 
 what has become of him 
 he is dead 
 that is good 
 he seated himself near them made cosette sit down and took their four hands in his aged and wrinkled hands 
 she is exquisite this darling 
 a masterpiece this cosette she is a very little girl and a very great lady 
 she will only be a baroness which is a come down for her she was born a marquise what eyelashes she has 
 get it well fixed in your noddles my children that you are in the true road 
 love each other be foolish about it 
 love is the folly of men and the wit of god adore each other 
 only he added suddenly becoming gloomy what a misfortune 
 it has just occurred to me 
 more than half of what i possess is swallowed up in an annuity so long as i live it will not matter but after my death a score of years hence ah my poor children you will not have a sou 
 your beautiful white hands madame la baronne will do the devil the honor of pulling him by the tail 
 tirer le diable par la queue to live from hand to mouth 
 at this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say 
 mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent possesses six hundred thousand francs 
 it was the voice of jean valjean 
 so far he had not uttered a single word no one seemed to be aware that he was there and he had remained standing erect and motionless behind all these happy people 
 what has mademoiselle euphrasie to do with the question inquired the startled grandfather 
 i am she replied cosette 
 six hundred thousand francs resumed m gillenormand 
 minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs possibly said jean valjean 
 and he laid on the table the package which mademoiselle gillenormand had mistaken for a book 
 jean valjean himself opened the package it was a bundle of they were turned over and counted 
 there were five hundred notes for a thousand francs each and one hundred and of five hundred 
 in all five hundred and thousand francs 
 this is a fine book said m gillenormand 
 five hundred and thousand francs murmured the aunt 
 this arranges things well does it not mademoiselle gillenormand senior said the grandfather 
 that devil of a marius has ferreted out the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams just trust to the love affairs of young folks now will you students find studentesses with six hundred thousand francs cherubino works better than rothschild 
 five hundred and thousand francs repeated mademoiselle gillenormand in a low tone 
 five hundred and one might as well say six hundred thousand 
 as for marius and cosette they were gazing at each other while this was going on they hardly heeded this detail

 book and grandfather 
 chapter iv 
 
 mademoiselle gillenormand ends by no longer thinking it a bad thing that m fauchelevent should have entered with something under his arm 
 cosette and marius beheld each other once more 
 what that interview was like we decline to say 
 there are things which one must not attempt to depict the sun is one of them 
 the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in marius chamber at the moment when cosette entered it 
 precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and gazing over it at cosette 
 she appeared on the threshold it seemed to him that she was surrounded by a glory 
 adorable he exclaimed 
 then he blew his nose noisily 
 cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven she was as thoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness she stammered all pale yet flushed she wanted to fling herself into marius arms and dared not 
 ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people 
 people are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone 
 lovers have no need of any people whatever 
 with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile it was monsieur fauchelevent it was jean valjean 
 he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely in black in perfectly new garments and with a white cravat 
 the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct bourgeois in this probable notary the bearer of the corpse who had sprung up at his door on the night of the th of june tattered muddy hideous haggard his face masked in blood and mire supporting in his arms the fainting marius still his scent was aroused 
 when m fauchelevent arrived with cosette the porter had not been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside 
 i know why it is but i help fancying that seen that face before 
 m fauchelevent in marius chamber remained apart near the door he had under his arm a package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume enveloped in paper 
 the enveloping paper was of a greenish hue and appeared to be mouldy 
 does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm mademoiselle gillenormand who did not like books demanded in a low tone of nicolette 
 well retorted m gillenormand who had overheard her in the same tone a learned man 
 what then 
 is that his fault monsieur boulard one of my acquaintances never walked out without a book under his arm either and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that 
 and with a bow he said aloud 
 monsieur tranchelevent 
 
 father gillenormand did not do it intentionally but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his 
 monsieur tranchelevent i have the honor of asking you on behalf of my grandson baron marius pontmercy for the hand of mademoiselle 
 monsieur tranchelevent bowed 
 settled said the grandfather 
 and turning to marius and cosette with both arms extended in blessing he cried 
 permission to adore each other 
 they did not require him to repeat it twice 
 so much the worse the chirping began 
 they talked low 
 marius resting on his elbow on his reclining chair cosette standing beside him 
 oh heavens murmured cosette i see you once again it is thou it is you the idea of going and fighting like that 
 but why 
 it is horrible i have been dead for four months 
 oh how wicked it was of you to go to that battle 
 what had i done to you 
 i pardon you but you will never do it again 
 a little while ago when they came to tell us to come to you i still thought that i was about to die but it was from joy 
 i was so sad 
 i have not taken the time to dress myself i must frighten people with my looks what will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar do speak 
 you let me do all the talking 
 we are still in the rue de arme 
 it seems that your shoulder was terrible they told me that you could put your fist in it 
 and then it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors 
 that is frightful i have cried till i have no eyes left 
 it is queer that a person can suffer like that 
 your grandfather has a very kindly air disturb yourself rise on your elbow you will injure yourself 
 oh how happy i am

 first epilogue 
 chapter xi 
 
 two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovs he had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to come to petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal founders 
 on reading that letter she always read her letters natasha herself suggested that he should go to petersburg though she would feel his absence very acutely she attributed immense importance to all her intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters to timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for his return he was given four weeks leave of absence 
 ever since that leave of absence had expired more than a fortnight before natasha had been in a constant state of alarm depression and irritability 
 denisov now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear a dull dejected look random replies and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress 
 natasha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her mother her brother sonya or countess mary in their efforts to console her tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning 
 all nonsense all rubbish those discussions which lead to nothing and all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed 
 and she would go to the nursery to nurse petya her only boy no one else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose that creature said you are angry you are jealous you would like to pay him out you are afraid but here am i and i am he and that was unanswerable it was more than true 
 during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for comfort so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him and he fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was just what she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily 
 she was nursing her boy when the sound of sleigh was heard at the front door and the old nurse knowing how to please her mistress entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face 
 has he come natasha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move lest she should rouse the dozing baby 
 come whispered the nurse 
 the blood rushed to face and her feet involuntarily moved but she could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his eyes and looked at her here he seemed to be saying and again lazily smacked his lips 
 cautiously withdrawing her breast natasha rocked him a little handed him to the nurse and went with rapid steps toward the door but at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon and she glanced round the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot 
 go worry go she whispered smiling with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress 
 natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom 
 denisov who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe now for the first time recognized the old natasha a flood of brilliant joyful light poured from her transfigured face 
 come she exclaimed as she ran past and denisov felt that he too was delighted that pierre whom he did not much care for had returned 
 on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf he really he he has come she said to herself and rushing at him embraced him pressed his head to her breast and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy happy face covered with hoarfrost yes it is he happy and contented 
 then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight and the joy that had lit up her face vanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words 
 yes all very well for you you are pleased had a good time but what about me you might at least have shown consideration for the children i am nursing and my milk was spoiled petya was at door but you were enjoying yourself yes enjoying 
 pierre knew he was not to blame for he could not have come sooner he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so he made a piteous frightened face and bent down 
 i could not on my honor but how is petya 
 all right now come along i wonder not ashamed if only you could see what i was like without you how i suffered 
 you are well 
 come come she said not letting go of his arm and they went to their rooms 
 when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby son who was again awake on his huge right palm and dandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the broad face with its toothless open mouth the storm was long since over and there was bright joyous sunshine on face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child 
 and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore she asked 
 yes capitally 
 you see he holds it up she meant the head but how he did frighten me seen the princess is it true in love with that 
 yes just fancy 
 at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the baby on his hand stooped kissed them and replied to their inquiries but in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed the baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention 
 how sweet said countess mary looking at and playing with the baby now nicholas she added turning to her husband i understand how it is you see the charm of these delicious marvels 
 i and replied nicholas looking coldly at the baby a lump of flesh come along pierre 
 and yet such an affectionate father said countess mary vindicating her husband but only after they are a year old or so 
 now pierre nurses them splendidly said natasha he says his hand is just made for a seat just look 
 only not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse

 deposit your money in a forest rather than with a notary 
 the reader has no doubt understood without necessitating a lengthy explanation that jean valjean after the champmathieu affair had been able thanks to his first escape of a few days duration to come to paris and to withdraw in season from the hands of laffitte the sum earned by him under the name of monsieur madeleine at and that fearing that he might be recaptured which eventually had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of montfermeil in the locality known as the the sum six hundred and thirty thousand francs all in was not very bulky and was contained in a box only in order to preserve the box from dampness he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings 
 in the same coffer he had placed his other treasures the candlesticks 
 it will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape from the man seen one evening for the first time by boulatruelle was jean valjean 
 later on every time that jean valjean needed money he went to get it in the hence the absences which we have mentioned 
 he had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather in a known to himself alone

 boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe 
 the actual sum was five hundred and thousand five hundred francs 
 jean valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for shall see hereafter he thought 
 the difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years from to 
 the five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs 
 jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint 
 moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert the story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in the moniteur how a police inspector named javert had been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses between the pont au change and the and that a writing left by this man otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a fit of mental aberration and a fact thought jean valjean since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must have been already mad

 moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert the story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in the moniteur how a police inspector named javert had been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses between the pont au change and the and that a writing left by this man otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a fit of mental aberration and a fact thought jean valjean since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must have been already mad

 first epilogue 
 chapter xii 
 
 as in every large household there were at bald hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others every event joyful or sad that took place in that house was important to all these worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others 
 for instance return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so 
 the servants the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life were glad of return because they knew that when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day attend to the estate and would would be in better spirits and temper and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays 
 the children and their governesses were glad of return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only piece to which as he said all possible dances could be danced and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all 
 young nicholas now a slim lad of fifteen delicate and intelligent with curly hair and beautiful eyes was delighted because uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection no one had instilled into him this love for pierre whom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him and little nicholas did love his uncle but loved him with just a shade of contempt pierre however he adored he did not want to be an hussar or a knight of st george like his uncle nicholas he wanted to be learned wise and kind like pierre in presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to him he did not miss a single word he uttered and would afterwards with dessalles or by himself recall and reconsider the meaning of everything pierre had said past life and his unhappiness prior to of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard his adventures in moscow his captivity platon karataev of whom he had heard from pierre his love for natasha of whom the lad was also particularly fond and especially friendship with the father whom nicholas could not remember all this made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint 
 from broken remarks about natasha and his father from the emotion with which pierre spoke of that dead father and from the careful reverent tenderness with which natasha spoke of him the boy who was only just beginning to guess what love is derived the notion that his father had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his friend but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture so the boy also was happy that pierre had arrived 
 the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in 
 the members of the family not to mention his wife were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully 
 the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them and especially that natasha would now be herself again 
 pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations 
 though the most and forgetful of men pierre with the aid of a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgetting his mother and commissions nor the dress material for a present to belova nor toys for his nephews in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything but in time he grew used to this demand knowing that natasha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house and never forgot anything if he now incurred censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things to her other defects as most people thought them but which to pierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she now added stinginess 
 from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before and that his affairs which had been in disorder of late chiefly because of his first debts had begun to improve 
 life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive luxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was no longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power and so that way of life proved economical 
 with a merry smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases 
 what do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman 
 natasha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her 
 for belova excellent she felt the quality of the material it was a ruble an arshin i suppose 
 pierre told her the price 
 too dear natasha remarked how pleased the children will be and mamma too only you need not have bought me this she added unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls of a kind then just coming into fashion 
 adele tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned pierre 
 when am i to wear it and natasha stuck it in her coil of hair when i take little masha into society perhaps they will be fashionable again by then well go now 
 and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess rooms 
 the countess was sitting with her companion belova playing as usual when pierre and natasha came into the drawing room with parcels under their arms 
 the countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with a frill that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper lip had sunk in and her eyes were dim 
 after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence she ate drank slept or kept awake but did not live life gave her no new impressions she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only death could give her but until death came she had to go on living that is to use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her her life had no external aims only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weep work give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had a stomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs she cried as a child does because her nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext 
 thus in the morning especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext deafness 
 she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room 
 it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur 
 and when belova replied oh yes come she would mutter angrily o lord how stupid and deaf she is 
 another pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belova would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her faculty of thinking and the pretext for that was a game of patience when she needed to cry the deceased count would be the pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and his health would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the pretext would be countess mary when her vocal organs needed exercise which was usually toward seven when she had had an rest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience 
 the old condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between nicholas pierre natasha and countess mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed 
 but those glances expressed something more they said that she had played her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole self that we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield to her to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied memento mori said these glances 
 only the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her

 spared nor left behind but it hindreth the march yea and the care of it sometimes loseth or disturbed the victory of great riches there is no real use except it be in the distribution the rest is but conceit so saith solomon where much is there are many to consume it and what hath the owner but the sight of it with his eyes 
 
 the personal fruition in any man cannot reach to feel great riches there is a custody of them or a power of dole and donative of them or a fame of them but no solid use to the owner do you not see what feigned prices are set upon little stones and rarities and what works of ostentation are undertaken because there might seem to be some use of great riches but then you will say they may be of use to buy men out of dangers or troubles 
 as solomon saith riches are as a strong hold in the imagination of the rich man but bus is excellently expressed that it is in imagination and not always in fact for certainly great riches have sold more men than they have bought out seek not proud riches but such as thou mayest get justly use soberly distribute cheerfully and leave contentedly yet have no abstract nor friarly contempt of them but distinguish as cicero saith well of rabirius postumus in studio rei amplificandae apparebat non avaritiae praedam sed instumenturn bonitati quaeri hearken also to solomon and beware of hasty gathering of riches qidfestinat ad divitias non erit insons the poets feign that when plutus which is riches is sent from jupiter he limps and goes slowly but when he is sent from pluto he runs and is swift of foot meaning that riches gotten by good means and just labour pace slowly but when they come by the death of others as by the course of inheritance testaments and the like they come tumbling upon a man but it mought be applied likewise to pluto taking him for the devil for when riches come from the devil as by fraud and oppression and unjust means they come upon speed the ways to enrich are many and most of them foul

 fameuil and dahlia were humming 
 tholomyes was was laughing fantine smiling listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at 
 favourite gazed tenderly at blachevelle and said 
 blachevelle i adore you 
 this called forth a question from blachevelle 
 what would you do favourite if i were to cease to love you 
 i cried favourite 
 ah 
 do not say that even in you were to cease to love me i would spring after you i would scratch you i should rend you i would throw you into the water i would have you arrested 
 blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous of a man who is tickled in his favourite resumed 
 yes i would scream to the police 
 ah 
 i should not restrain myself not at all 
 rabble 
 blachevelle threw himself back in his chair in an ecstasy and closed both eyes proudly 
 dahlia as she ate said in a low voice to favourite amid the uproar 
 so you really idolize him deeply that blachevelle of yours 
 i 
 i detest him replied favourite in the same tone seizing her fork again 
 he is avaricious 
 i love the little fellow opposite me in my house 
 he is very nice that young man do you know can see that he is an actor by profession 
 i love soon as he comes in his mother says to him 
 ah mon dieu my peace of mind is gone 
 there he goes with his shouting 
 but my dear you are splitting my head 
 so he goes up to garrets to black holes as high as he can mount and there he sets to singing declaiming how do i know what so that he can be heard down earns twenty sous a day at an by penning is the son of a former precentor of ah he is very nice 
 he idolizes me so that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes he said to me 
 mamselle make your gloves into fritters and i will eat them 
 it is only artists who can say such things as that 
 ah he is very am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little mind i tell blachevelle that i adore i lie 
 hey 
 how i do lie 
 favourite paused and then went on 
 i am sad you see dahlia 
 it has done nothing but rain all summer the wind irritates me the wind does not abate 
 blachevelle is very stingy there are hardly any green peas in the market one does not know what to eat 
 i have the spleen as the english say butter is so dear and then you see it is horrible here we are dining in a room with a bed in it and that disgusts me with life

 return of the jedi 
 v 
 
 the trees of endor stood a thousand feet tall their trunks covered with shaggy rustbark rose straight as a pillar some of them as big around as a house some thin as aleg their foliage was spindly but lush in color scattering the sunlight in patterns over the forest floor 
 distributed thickly among these ancient giants was the usual array of of several species various deciduous forms variously gnarled and groundcover was primarily fern but so dense in spots as to resemble a gentlegreen sea that rippled softly in the forest breeze 
 this was the entire moon verdant primeval silent light filtered through thesheltering branches like golden ichor as if the very air were alive it was warm andit was cool this was endor 
 the stolen imperial shuttle sat in a clearing many miles from the imperiallanding port camouflaged with a blanket of dead branches leaves and mulch inaddition the little ship was thoroughly dwarfed by the towering trees its steely hullmight have looked incongruous here had it not been so totally inconspicuous 
 on the hill adjacent to the clearing the rebel contingent was just beginning tomake its way up a steep trail leia chewie han and luke led the way followed insingle file by the raggedy helmeted squad of the strike team this unit wascomposed of elite groundfighters of the rebel alliance a scruffy bunch in someways each been for initiative cunning and ferocity some weretrained commandos some paroled they all hated the empire with apassion that exceeded and they all knew this was the crucial they failed to destroy the shield generator here the rebellion was doomed nosecond chances 
 consequently no one had tell them to be alert as they made their way silently upthe forest path they were every on more alert than they had ever been 
 and brought up the rear of brigade domedpates swiveled round and round as he went blinking his sensor lights at theinfinitely tall trees which surrounded them 
 he commented to threepio 
 no i think pretty here his golden companion replied testily withour luck inhabited solely by monsters 
 the trooper just ahead of threepio turned around and gave them a 
 threepio turned back to artoo and whispered quiet artoo 
 they were all a bit nervous 
 up ahead chewie and leia reached the crest of the hill they dropped to theground crawled the last few feet and peered over the edge chewbacca raised hisfeet and peered over the edge chewbacca raised his great paw signaling the rest ofthe group to stop all at once the forest seemed to become much more silent 
 luke and han crawled forward on their bellies to view what the others wereobserving pointing through the ferns chewie and leia cautioned stealth not farbelow in a glen beside a clear pool two imperial scouts had set up temporary were fixing a meal of rations and were preoccupied warming it over a portablecooker two speeder bikes were parked nearby 
 should we try to go around whispered leia 
 take time luke shook his head 
 han peeked from behind a rock yeah and if they catch sight of us and whole for nothing 
 is it just the two of them leia still sounded skeptical 
 take a look smiled luke with a sigh of tension about to be released theyall responded with a similar grin it was beginning 
 leia motioned the rest of the squad to remain where they were then she and chewbacca quietly edged closer to the scout camp 
 when they were quite near the clearing but still covered by underbrush soloslid quickly to the lead position stay here he rasped chewie and i will takecare of this he flashed them his most roguish smile 
 quietly warned luke there might be 
 but before he could finish han jumped up with his furry partner and rushed intothe clearing 
 more out there luke finished speaking to himself he looked over at leia 
 she shrugged you expect some things never changed 
 before luke could respond though they were distracted by a loud commotion inthe glen they flattened to the ground and watched 
 han was engaged in a rousing fist fight with one of the lookedso happy in days the other scout jumped on his speeder bike to escape but bythe time ignited the engines chewie was able to get off a few shots from hiscrossbow laser the scout crashed instantly against an enormous tree abrief muffled explosion followed 
 leia drew her laser pistol and raced into the battle zone followed closely byluke as soon as they were running clear though several large laser blasts went offall around them tumbling them to the ground leia lost her gun 
 dazed they both looked up to see two more imperial scouts emerge from the farside of the clearing heading for their speeder bikes hidden in the peripheral scouts holstered their pistols as they mounted the bikes and fired up the engines 
 leia staggered to her feet over there two more of them 
 i see em answered luke rising stay here 
 but leia had ideas of her own she ran to the remaining rocket it up and took off in pursuit of the fleeing scouts as she tore past luke hejumped up behind her on the bike and off the flew 
 quick center switch he shouted to her over her shoulder over the roar of therocket engines jam their comlinks 
 as luke and leia soared out of the clearing after the imperials han and chewiewere just subduing the last scout hey wait solo shouted but they were threw his weapon to the ground in frustration and the rest of the rebel commandosquad poured over the rise into the clearing 
 luke and leia sped through the dense foliage a few feet off the ground leia atthe controls luke grabbing on behind her the two escaping imperial scouts had agood lead but at two hundred miles per hour leia was the better talent ranin her family 
 she let off a burst from the laser cannon periodically but was still toofar behind to be very accurate the explosions hit away from the moving trees and setting the shrubbery afire as the bikes weaved in and outbetween massive imposing branches 
 move closer luke shouted 
 leia opened the throttle closed the gap the two scouts sensed their pursuergaining and recklessly veered this way and that skimming through a narrow openingbetween two trees one of the bikes scraped the bark tipping the scout almost out ofcontrol slowing him significantly 
 get alongside luke yelled into ear 
 she pulled her speeder so close to the their steering vanes scrapedhideously against each other luke suddenly leaped from the back of bike tothe back of the grabbed the imperial warrior around the neck and flipped himoff the trooper smashed into a thick trunk with a and settled forever into the sea of ferns 
 luke scooted forward to the seat of the speeder bike played with thecontrols a few seconds and lurched forward following leia pulled two of them now tore after the remaining scout 
 over hill and under stonebridge they flew narrowly avoiding collision flamingdry vines in their afterburn the chase swung north and passed a gully where twomore imperial scouts were resting a moment later they swung into pursuit nowhot on luke and tail blasting away with laser cannon luke still behind leiatook a glancing blow 
 keep on that one he shouted up at her indicating the scout in the lead the two behind us 
 leia shot ahead luke at the same instant flared up his retrorocket slammingthe bike into rapid deceleration the two scouts on his tail zipped past him in a bluron either side unable to slow their momentum luke immediately roared into highvelocity again firing with his blasters suddenly in pursuit of his pursuers 
 his third round hit its mark one of the scouts blown out of control wentspinning against a boulder in a rumble of flame 
 the cohort took a single glance at the flash and put his bike intosupercharge mode speeding even faster luke kept pace 
 far ahead leia and the first scout continued their own slalomthrough the barricades of impassive trunks and branches she had tobrake through so many turns in fact leia seemed unable to draw any closer to herquarry suddenly she shot into the air at an unbelievably steep incline and quicklyvanished from sight 
 the scout turned in confusion uncertain whether to relax or cringe at sudden disappearance her whereabouts became clear soon enough outof the leia dove down on him cannon blasting from above the took the shock wave from a near hit her speed was even greater than and in a moment she was racing alongside him but before she knewwhat was happening he reached down and drew a handgun from his she could react he fired 
 her bike spun out of control she jumped free just in speederexploded on a giant tree as leia rolled clear into a tangle of matted vines rotting water the last thing she saw was the orange fireball through a cloud ofsmoking greenery and then blackness 
 the scout looked behind him at the explosion with a satisfied sneer when hefaced forward again though the smug look faded for he was on a collision coursewith a fallen tree in a moment it was all over but the flaming 
 meanwhile luke was closing fast on the last scout as they wove from tree totree luke eased up behind and then drew even with the imperial rider the fleeingsoldier suddenly swerved slamming his bike into both tippedprecariously barely missing a large fallen trunk in their path the scout zoomedunder it luke over when he came down on the other side he crashed directlyon top of the vehicle their steering vanes locked 
 the bikes were shaped more or less like sleds with long thin rodsextending from their snouts and fluttery ailerons for guidance at the tip of the these vanes locked the bikes flew as one though either rider could steer 
 the scout banked hard right to try to smash luke into an onrushing grove ofsaplings on the right but at the last second luke leaned all his weight left turningthe locked speeders actually horizontal with luke on top the scout on the bottom 
 the biker scout suddenly stopped resisting leftward leaning and threw hisown weight in the same direction resulting in the bikes flipping over three hundredsixty degrees and coming to rest exactly upright once morebut with an enormoustree looming immediately in front of luke 
 without thinking he leaped from his bike a fraction of a second later thescout veered steeply steering vanes riderless speedercrashed explosively into the redwood 
 luke rolled decelerating up a slope the scout swooped around and came looking for him 
 luke stumbled out of the bushes as the speeder was bearing down on him fullthrottle laser cannon firing luke ignited his lightsaber and stood his ground hisweapon deflected every bolt the scout fired at luke but the bike kept coming in afew moments the two would meet the bike accelerated even more intent on bodilyslicing the young jedi in half at the last moment though luke perfect timing like a master matador facing a a singlemighty slash of his lightsaber 
 the bike quickly began to shudder then pitch and roll in a second it was outof control entirely and in another second it was a rumbling billow of fire on the forestfloor 
 luke snuffed out his lightsaber and headed back to join the others 
 shuttle swung around the unfinished portion of the death star and settledfluidly into the main docking bay soundless bearings lowered the dark were his feet as they glided down the chilly steel chill with purpose werehis strides and swift 
 the main corridor was filled with courtiers all awaiting an audience with theemperor vader curled his lip at all pompous toadys in their velvetrobes and painted faces perfumed bishops passing notes and passing judgmentsamong who else cared oily bent low from theweight of jewelry still warm from a previous dying flesh easy violent menand women lusting to be tampered with 
 vader had no patience for such petty filth he passed them without a many of them would have paid dearly for felicitous glance from the high darklord 
 when he reached the elevator to the tower he found the door heavily armed royal guards flanked the shaft seemingly unaware presence out of the shadow an officer stepped forward directly in path preventing his further approach 
 you may not enter the officer said evenly 
 vader did not waste words he raised his hand fingers outstretched toward throat ineffably the officer began to choke his knees started face turned ashen 
 gasping for air he spoke again it is 
 like a spring vader released the man from his remote grip the again sank to the floor trembling he rubbed his neck gently 
 i will await his convenience vader said he turned and looked out of theview window endor glowed there floating black space almost as if itwere radiant from some internal source of energy he felt its pull like a magnet likea vacuum like a torch in dead night 
 han and chewie crouched opposite each other in the forest clearing being near the rest of the strike squad much as was around them in groups of twos and threes they all waited 
 even threepio was silent he sat beside artoo polishing his fingers for lack ofanything better to do the others checked their watches or their weapons as theafternoon sunlight ticked away 
 artoo sat unmoving except for the little radar screen that stuck out the top of hisblue and silver dome revolving scanning the forest he exuded the calm patienceof a utilized function a program being run 
 suddenly he beeped 
 threepio ceased his obsessive polishing and looked apprehensively into theforest coming he translated 
 the rest of the squad faced out weapons were raised a twig cracked beyondthe western perimeter no one breathed 
 with a weary stride luke stepped out of the foliage into the clearing allrelaxed lowered their guns luke was tired to care he plopped down on the harddirt beside solo and lay back with an exhausted groan 
 hard day huh kid han commented 
 luke sat up on one elbow smiling it seemed like an awful lot of effort andnoise just to nail a couple of imperial scouts and they even gotten to the reallytough part yet but han could still maintain his light tone it was a state of particular brand of charm luke hoped it never vanished from the we get to that generator he retorted in kind 
 solo looked around into the forest luke had just come from leia 
 face suddenly turned to one of concern she come back 
 i thought she was with you voice marginally rose in pitch and volume 
 we got split up luke explained he exchanged a grim look with solo thenboth of them slowly stood we better look for her 
 you want to rest a while han suggested he could see the fatigue face and wanted to spare him for the coming confrontation which wouldsurely take more strength than any of them had 
 i want to find leia he said softly 
 han nodded without argument he signaled to the rebel officer who wassecond in command of the strike squad the officer ran up and saluted 
 take the squad ahead ordered solo rendezvous at the shieldgenerator at 
 the officer saluted again and immediately organized the troops within aminute they were filing silently into the forest greatly relieved to be moving at last 
 luke chewbacca general solo and the two droids faced in the oppositedirection artoo led the way his revolving scanner sensing for all the parametersthat described his mistress and the others followed him into the woods 
 the first thing leia was aware of was her left elbow it was wet it was lyingin a pool of water getting quite soaked 
 she moved the elbow out of the water with a little splash revealing somethingelse in her entire arm when it moved for the time being she decided tokeep it still 
 the next thing to enter her consciousness were sounds the splash her elbowhad made the rustle of leaves an occasional bird chirp forest sounds with agrunt she took a short breath and noted the grunting sound 
 smells began to fill her nostrils next humid mossy smells leafy oxygen odor of a distant honey the vapor of rare flowers 
 taste came with taste of blood on her tongue she opened andclosed her mouth a few times to localize where the blood was coming from but instead the attempt only brought the recognition of new herhead in her neck in her back she started to move her arms again but this entaileda whole catalogue of new pains so once again she rested 
 next she allowed temperature to waft into her sensorium sun warmed thefingers of her right hand while the palm in shadow stayed cool a breeze draftedthe back of her legs her left hand pressed against the skin of her belly was warm 
 she feltawake 
 actually to witness the damage since seeing things made themreal and seeing her own broken body was not a reality she wanted she opened her eyes things were blurry here at ground browns and grays in the foreground becoming progressively brighter andgreener in the distance slowly things came into focus 
 slowly she saw the ewok 
 a strange small furry creature he stood three feet from face and no morethan three feet tall he had large dark curious brownish eyes and stubby completely covered head to foot with soft brown fur he looked likenothing so much as the stuffed baby wookiee doll leia remembered playing with as achild in face when he first saw the creature standing before her she thought itmerely a dream a childhood memory rising out of her addled brain 
 but this a dream it was an ewok and his name was wicket 
 now was he exclusively as leia focused further she could see a knifestrapped to his waist it was all he wore save for a thing leather mantle onlycovering his head 
 they watched each other unmoving for a long minute the ewok seemedpuzzled by the princess uncertain of what she was or what she intended at themoment leia intended to see if she could sit up 
 she sat up with a groan 
 the sound apparently frightened the little fluffball he rapidly stumbledbackward tripped and fell eeeeep he squeaked 
 leia scrutinized herself closely looking for signs of serious damage herclothes were torn she had cuts bruises and scrapes nothing seemedto be broken or irreparable on the other hand she had no idea where she groaned again 
 that did it for the ewok he jumped up grabbed a spear andheld it defensively in her direction warily he circled poking the pointed javelin ather clearly more fearful than aggressive 
 hey cut that out leia brushed the weapon away with annoyance that wasall she needed be skewered by a teddy bear more gently she not going to hurt you 
 gingerly she stood up testing her legs the ewok backed away with caution 
 be afraid leia tried to put reassurance into her voice i just want tosee what happened to my bike here she knew the more she talked in this tone themore at ease it would put the little creature moreover she knew if she was was doing okay 
 her legs were a little unsteady but she was able to walk slowly over to thecharred remains of the speeder now lying in a pile at the base of thepartially blackened tree 
 her movement was away from the ewok who like a skittish puppy took this asa safe sign and followed her to the wreckage leia picked the imperial laserpistol off the ground it was all that was left of him 
 i think i got off at the right time she muttered 
 the ewok appraised the scene with his big shiny eyes nodded shook his squeaked vociferously for several seconds 
 leia looked all around her at the dense forest then sat down with a sigh on afallen log she was at with the ewok now and they once again regardedeach other a little concerned trouble is sort of stuck here she i even know where here is 
 she put her head in her hands partly to mull over the situation partly to rubsome of the soreness from her temples wicket sat down beside her and mimickedher posture in paws elbows on let out a little sympatheticewok sigh 
 leia laughed appreciatively and scratched the small furry the ears he purred like a kitten 
 you happen to have a comlink on you by any chance she hoped maybe talking about it would give her an idea the ewokblinked a few he only gave her a mystified look leia smiled no iguess not 
 suddenly wicket froze his ears twitched and he sniffed the air he tilted hishead in an attitude of keen attention 
 what is it leia whispered something was obviously amiss then sheheard it a quiet snap in the bushes beyond a tentative rustling 
 all at once the ewok let out a loud terrified screech leia drew her behind the log wicket scurried beside her and squeezed under it a longsilence followed tense uncertain leia trained her senses on the near to fight 
 for all her readiness she expected the laser bolt to come from where off to the right it exploded in front of the log with a shower of light andpine needles she returned the fire short just as quicklysensed something behind her slowly she swiveled to find an imperial scoutstanding over her his weapon leveled at her head he reached out his hand for thepistol she held 
 take that he ordered 
 without warning a furry hand came out from under the log and jabbed the scoutin the leg with a knife the man howled in pain began jumping about on one foot 
 leia dove for his fallen laser pistol she rolled fired and hit the scout squarelyin the chest his heart 
 quickly the forest was quiet once more the noise and light swallowed up as ifthey had never been leia lay still where she was panting softly waiting for anotherattack none came 
 wicket poked his fuzzy head up from under the log and looked around eeeprrp scrp ooooh he mumbled in a tone of awe 
 leia hopped up ran all about the area crouched turned her head from side toside it seemed safe for the time being she motioned to her chubby new on better get out of here 
 as they moved into the thick flora wicket took the lead leia was unsure atfirst but he shrieked urgently at her and tugged her sleeve so she relinquishedcontrol to the odd little beast and followed him 
 she cast her mind adrift for a while letting her feet carry her nimbly alongamong the gargantuan trees she was struck suddenly not by the smallness of theewok who guided her but by her own smallness next to these trees they were tenthousand years old some of them and tall beyond sight they were temples to she championed they reached out to the rest of the universe she feltherself part of their greatness but also dwarfed by it 
 and lonely she felt lonely here in this forest of giants all her life among giants of her own people her father the great senator organa hermother then minister of education her peers and friends giants all 
 but these trees they were like mighty exclamation points announcing theirown preeminence they were here they were older than time they would behere long after leia was gone after the rebellion after the empire 
 and then she feel lonely again but felt a part again of these beings a part of them across time and space connected by the vibrant vitalforce of which 
 it was confusing a part and apart she grasp it she felt large andsmall brave and timid she felt like a tiny creative spark dancing about in the firesof lifedancing behind a furtive pudgy midget bear who kept beckoning her deeperinto the woods 
 it was this then that the alliance was fighting to creatures inmammoth forests helping scared brave princesses to safety leia wished her parentswere alive so she could tell them 
 lord vader stepped out of the elevator and stood at the entrance to the throneroom the hummed either side of the shaft casting an eerie glow on theroyal guards who waited there he marched resolutely down the walkway up thestairs and paused subserviently behind the throne he kneeled motionless 
 almost immediately he heard the voice rise rise and friend 
 vader rose as the throne swiveled around and the emperor faced him 
 they made eye contact from and a breath away across thatabyss vader responded my master a small rebel force has penetrated the shieldand landed on endor 
 yes i know there was no hint of surprise in his tone rather fulfillment 
 vader noted this then went on my son is with them 
 the brow furrowed less than a millimeter his voice remained slightly curious are you sure 
 i felt him my master it was almost a taunt he knew the emperor wasfrightened of young skywalker afraid of his power only together could vader andthe emperor hope to pull the jedi knight over to the dark side he said it his own singularity i felt him 
 strange that i have not the emperor murmured his eyes becoming both knew the force no one was infallible with its had everything to do with awareness with vision certainly vader and his sonwere more closely linked than was the emperor with young inaddition the emperor was now aware of a crosscurrent he read before abuckle in the force he quite understand i wonder if your feelings on thismatter are clear lord vader 
 they are clear my master he knew his presence it galled him andfueled him and lured him and howled in a voice of its own then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him emperor palpatinesaid simply as long as things were clear things were clear 
 he will come to me vader asked skeptically this was not what he felt hefelt drawn 
 of his own free will the emperor assured him it must be of his own freewill else all was lost a spirit could not be coerced into corruption it had to beseduced it had to participate activity it had to crave luke skywalker knewthese things and still he circled the black fire like a cat destinies could never beread with absolute skywalker would come that was clear i haveforeseen it his compassion for you will be his undoing compassion had alwaysbeen the weak belly of the jedi and forever would be it was the ultimatevulnerability the emperor had none the boy will come to you and you willthen bring him before me 
 vader bowed low as you wish 
 with casual malice the emperor dismissed the dark lord with grimanticipation vader strode out of the throne room to board the shuttle for endor 
 luke chewie han and threepio picked their way methodically through theundergrowth behind artoo whose antenna continued to revolve it was remarkablethe way the little droid was able to blaze a trail over jungle terrain like this but he didit without fuss the miniature cutting tools on his walkers and dome slicing neatlythrough anything too dense to push out of the way 
 artoo suddenly stopped causing some consternation on the part of his radar screen spun faster he clicked and whirred to himself then darted forwardwith an excited announcement vrrr deep dwp booooo dwee op 
 threepio raced behind him artoo says the rocket bikes are right 
 they broke into the clearing just ahead of the others but all stopped in a clumpon entering the charred debris of three speeder bikes was strewn around to mention the remains of some imperial scouts 
 they spread out to inspect the rubble little of note was evident except a tornpiece of jacket han held it soberly thinking 
 threepio spoke quietly sensor find no other trace of princess leia 
 i hope nowhere near here now han said to the trees he want toimagine her loss after all that had happened he simply believe it wouldend this way for her 
 looks like she ran into two of them luke said just to say something noneof them wanted to draw any conclusions 
 she seems to have done all right han responded somewhat tersely he wasaddressing luke but speaking to himself 
 only chewbacca seemed uninterested in the clearing in which they werestanding he stood facing the dense foliage beyond then wrinkled his nose sniffing 
 rahrr he shouted plunging into the thicket the others rushed after him 
 artoo whistled softly nervously 
 picking up what threepio snapped try to be more specific would you 
 the trees became significantly taller as the group pushed on not that it waspossible to see any higher but the girth of the trunks was increasingly massive therest of the forest was thinning a bit in the process making passage easier but givingthem the distinct sense that they were shrinking it was an ominous feeling 
 all at once the undergrowth gave way again to yet another open space at thecenter of this clearing a huge several shanks of raw meat the searchers stared thencautiously walked to the stake 
 this threepio voiced the collective question 
 nose was going wild in some kind of olfactory delirium he heldhimself back as long as he could but was finally unable to resist he reached out forone of the slabs of meat 
 no wait shouted luke 
 but it was too late the moment the meat was pulled from the stake a huge netsprang up all around the adventurers instantly hoisting them high above the a twisting jumble of arms and legs 
 artoo whistled was programmed to hate being thewookiee bayed his regret 
 han peeled a hairy paw away from his mouth spitting fur great work always thinking with your stomach 
 take it easy called luke just figure out how to get out of this tried but was unable to free his arms one locked behind him through the net onepinned to leg can anyone reach my lightsaber 
 artoo was bottommost he extended his cutting appendage and began clippingthe loops of the vinery net 
 solo meantime was trying to squeeze his arm past threepio trying to stretch toreach the lightsaber hanging at waist they settled jerkily as artoo cutthrough another piece of mesh leaving han pressed face to face with the protocoldroid 
 out of the way off of 
 how do you think i feel threepio charged there was no protocol in asituation like this 
 i really han began but suddenly artoo cut through the last link andthe entire group crashed out of the net to the ground as they gradually regainedtheir senses sat up checked to make certain the others were all safe one by one theyrealized they were surrounded by twenty furry little creatures all wearing soft leatherhoods or caps all brandishing spears 
 one came close to han pushing a long spear in his face screeching eeee wk 
 solo knocked the weapon aside with a curt directive point that thingsomewhere else 
 a second ewok became alarmed and lunged at han again he deflected thespear but in the process got cut on the arm 
 luke reached for his lightsaber but just then a third ewok ran forward pushingthe more aggressive ones out of the way and shrieked a long string of seeminginvective at them in a decidedly scolding tone at this luke decided to hold off onhis lightsaber 
 han was wounded and angry though he started to holster with a be all right he added never confuse ability with appearance benused to tell actions with motivations luke was uncertain of these littlefurries but he had a feeling 
 han held his arm and held his peace as the ewoks swarmed all their weapons luke even relinquished his lightsaber chewiegrowled suspiciously 
 artoo and threepio were just extracting themselves from the collapsed net asthe ewoks chattered excitedly to each other 
 luke turned to the gold droid threepio can you understand what 
 threepio rose from the mesh trap feeling himself for dents or rattles oh myhead he complained 
 at the sight of his fully upright body the ewoks began squeaking amongthemselves pointing and gesticulating 
 threepio spoke to the one who appeared to be the leader chree breeb a shurrdu 
 bloh wreee dbleeop weeschhreee answered the fuzzy beast 
 du wee sheess 
 reeop glwah wrrripsh 
 shreee 
 suddenly one of the ewoks dropped his spear with a little gasp and prostratedhimself before the shiny droid in another moment all the ewoks followed looked at his friends with a slightly embarrassed shrug 
 chewie let out a puzzled bark artoo whirred speculatively luke and hanregarded the battalion of kowtowing ewoks in wonder 
 then at some invisible signal from one of their group the small creatures beganto chant in unison eekee whoh eekee whoh rheakee rheekee whoh 
 han looked at threepio with total disbelief you say to them 
 hello i think threepio replied almost apologetically he hastened to could be mistaken using a very primitive dialecti believe they think sort of god 
 chewbacca and artoo thought that was very funny they spent several secondshysterically barking and whistling before they finally managed to quiet had to wipe a tear from his eye 
 han just shook his head with a look of patience well howabout using your diving influence to get us out of this he suggested solicitously 
 threepio pulled himself up to his full height and spoke with unrelentingdecorum i beg your pardon captain solo but that be proper 
 proper solo roared he always knew this pompous droid was going to gotoo far with him one this might well be the day 
 against my programming to impersonate a deity he replied to solo as ifnothing so obvious needed explanation 
 han moved threateningly toward the protocol droid his fingers itching to pull aplug listen you pile of bolts if you he got no farther as fifteen ewokspears were thrust menacingly in his face just kidding he smiled affably 
 the procession of ewoks wound its way slowly into the somber creatures inching through a maze the sun had nearlyset now and the long shadows made the cavernous domain even moreimposing than before yet the ewoks seemed well at home turning down eachdense corridor of vines with precision 
 on their shoulders they carried their four chewbacca to long poles wrapped around and around with vines immobilizing themas if they were wriggling larvae in coarse leafy cocoons 
 behind the captives threepio borne on a of branches in theshape of a carried high upon the shoulders of the lowly ewoks like aroyal potentate he perused the mighty forest through which they carried lavender sunset glowing between the vinery the exotic flowers starting toclose the ageless trees the glistening knew that no one before him hadever appreciated these things in just precisely the manner he was now no one elsehad his sensors his circuits his programs his memory so in some realway he was the creator of this little universe its images and colors 
 and it was good

 return of the jedi 
 v 
 
 the trees of endor stood a thousand feet tall their trunks covered with shaggy rustbark rose straight as a pillar some of them as big around as a house some thin as aleg their foliage was spindly but lush in color scattering the sunlight in patterns over the forest floor 
 distributed thickly among these ancient giants was the usual array of of several species various deciduous forms variously gnarled and groundcover was primarily fern but so dense in spots as to resemble a gentlegreen sea that rippled softly in the forest breeze 
 this was the entire moon verdant primeval silent light filtered through thesheltering branches like golden ichor as if the very air were alive it was warm andit was cool this was endor 
 the stolen imperial shuttle sat in a clearing many miles from the imperiallanding port camouflaged with a blanket of dead branches leaves and mulch inaddition the little ship was thoroughly dwarfed by the towering trees its steely hullmight have looked incongruous here had it not been so totally inconspicuous 
 on the hill adjacent to the clearing the rebel contingent was just beginning tomake its way up a steep trail leia chewie han and luke led the way followed insingle file by the raggedy helmeted squad of the strike team this unit wascomposed of elite groundfighters of the rebel alliance a scruffy bunch in someways each been for initiative cunning and ferocity some weretrained commandos some paroled they all hated the empire with apassion that exceeded and they all knew this was the crucial they failed to destroy the shield generator here the rebellion was doomed nosecond chances 
 consequently no one had tell them to be alert as they made their way silently upthe forest path they were every on more alert than they had ever been 
 and brought up the rear of brigade domedpates swiveled round and round as he went blinking his sensor lights at theinfinitely tall trees which surrounded them 
 he commented to threepio 
 no i think pretty here his golden companion replied testily withour luck inhabited solely by monsters 
 the trooper just ahead of threepio turned around and gave them a 
 threepio turned back to artoo and whispered quiet artoo 
 they were all a bit nervous 
 up ahead chewie and leia reached the crest of the hill they dropped to theground crawled the last few feet and peered over the edge chewbacca raised hisfeet and peered over the edge chewbacca raised his great paw signaling the rest ofthe group to stop all at once the forest seemed to become much more silent 
 luke and han crawled forward on their bellies to view what the others wereobserving pointing through the ferns chewie and leia cautioned stealth not farbelow in a glen beside a clear pool two imperial scouts had set up temporary were fixing a meal of rations and were preoccupied warming it over a portablecooker two speeder bikes were parked nearby 
 should we try to go around whispered leia 
 take time luke shook his head 
 han peeked from behind a rock yeah and if they catch sight of us and whole for nothing 
 is it just the two of them leia still sounded skeptical 
 take a look smiled luke with a sigh of tension about to be released theyall responded with a similar grin it was beginning 
 leia motioned the rest of the squad to remain where they were then she and chewbacca quietly edged closer to the scout camp 
 when they were quite near the clearing but still covered by underbrush soloslid quickly to the lead position stay here he rasped chewie and i will takecare of this he flashed them his most roguish smile 
 quietly warned luke there might be 
 but before he could finish han jumped up with his furry partner and rushed intothe clearing 
 more out there luke finished speaking to himself he looked over at leia 
 she shrugged you expect some things never changed 
 before luke could respond though they were distracted by a loud commotion inthe glen they flattened to the ground and watched 
 han was engaged in a rousing fist fight with one of the lookedso happy in days the other scout jumped on his speeder bike to escape but bythe time ignited the engines chewie was able to get off a few shots from hiscrossbow laser the scout crashed instantly against an enormous tree abrief muffled explosion followed 
 leia drew her laser pistol and raced into the battle zone followed closely byluke as soon as they were running clear though several large laser blasts went offall around them tumbling them to the ground leia lost her gun 
 dazed they both looked up to see two more imperial scouts emerge from the farside of the clearing heading for their speeder bikes hidden in the peripheral scouts holstered their pistols as they mounted the bikes and fired up the engines 
 leia staggered to her feet over there two more of them 
 i see em answered luke rising stay here 
 but leia had ideas of her own she ran to the remaining rocket it up and took off in pursuit of the fleeing scouts as she tore past luke hejumped up behind her on the bike and off the flew 
 quick center switch he shouted to her over her shoulder over the roar of therocket engines jam their comlinks 
 as luke and leia soared out of the clearing after the imperials han and chewiewere just subduing the last scout hey wait solo shouted but they were threw his weapon to the ground in frustration and the rest of the rebel commandosquad poured over the rise into the clearing 
 luke and leia sped through the dense foliage a few feet off the ground leia atthe controls luke grabbing on behind her the two escaping imperial scouts had agood lead but at two hundred miles per hour leia was the better talent ranin her family 
 she let off a burst from the laser cannon periodically but was still toofar behind to be very accurate the explosions hit away from the moving trees and setting the shrubbery afire as the bikes weaved in and outbetween massive imposing branches 
 move closer luke shouted 
 leia opened the throttle closed the gap the two scouts sensed their pursuergaining and recklessly veered this way and that skimming through a narrow openingbetween two trees one of the bikes scraped the bark tipping the scout almost out ofcontrol slowing him significantly 
 get alongside luke yelled into ear 
 she pulled her speeder so close to the their steering vanes scrapedhideously against each other luke suddenly leaped from the back of bike tothe back of the grabbed the imperial warrior around the neck and flipped himoff the trooper smashed into a thick trunk with a and settled forever into the sea of ferns 
 luke scooted forward to the seat of the speeder bike played with thecontrols a few seconds and lurched forward following leia pulled two of them now tore after the remaining scout 
 over hill and under stonebridge they flew narrowly avoiding collision flamingdry vines in their afterburn the chase swung north and passed a gully where twomore imperial scouts were resting a moment later they swung into pursuit nowhot on luke and tail blasting away with laser cannon luke still behind leiatook a glancing blow 
 keep on that one he shouted up at her indicating the scout in the lead the two behind us 
 leia shot ahead luke at the same instant flared up his retrorocket slammingthe bike into rapid deceleration the two scouts on his tail zipped past him in a bluron either side unable to slow their momentum luke immediately roared into highvelocity again firing with his blasters suddenly in pursuit of his pursuers 
 his third round hit its mark one of the scouts blown out of control wentspinning against a boulder in a rumble of flame 
 the cohort took a single glance at the flash and put his bike intosupercharge mode speeding even faster luke kept pace 
 far ahead leia and the first scout continued their own slalomthrough the barricades of impassive trunks and branches she had tobrake through so many turns in fact leia seemed unable to draw any closer to herquarry suddenly she shot into the air at an unbelievably steep incline and quicklyvanished from sight 
 the scout turned in confusion uncertain whether to relax or cringe at sudden disappearance her whereabouts became clear soon enough outof the leia dove down on him cannon blasting from above the took the shock wave from a near hit her speed was even greater than and in a moment she was racing alongside him but before she knewwhat was happening he reached down and drew a handgun from his she could react he fired 
 her bike spun out of control she jumped free just in speederexploded on a giant tree as leia rolled clear into a tangle of matted vines rotting water the last thing she saw was the orange fireball through a cloud ofsmoking greenery and then blackness 
 the scout looked behind him at the explosion with a satisfied sneer when hefaced forward again though the smug look faded for he was on a collision coursewith a fallen tree in a moment it was all over but the flaming 
 meanwhile luke was closing fast on the last scout as they wove from tree totree luke eased up behind and then drew even with the imperial rider the fleeingsoldier suddenly swerved slamming his bike into both tippedprecariously barely missing a large fallen trunk in their path the scout zoomedunder it luke over when he came down on the other side he crashed directlyon top of the vehicle their steering vanes locked 
 the bikes were shaped more or less like sleds with long thin rodsextending from their snouts and fluttery ailerons for guidance at the tip of the these vanes locked the bikes flew as one though either rider could steer 
 the scout banked hard right to try to smash luke into an onrushing grove ofsaplings on the right but at the last second luke leaned all his weight left turningthe locked speeders actually horizontal with luke on top the scout on the bottom 
 the biker scout suddenly stopped resisting leftward leaning and threw hisown weight in the same direction resulting in the bikes flipping over three hundredsixty degrees and coming to rest exactly upright once morebut with an enormoustree looming immediately in front of luke 
 without thinking he leaped from his bike a fraction of a second later thescout veered steeply steering vanes riderless speedercrashed explosively into the redwood 
 luke rolled decelerating up a slope the scout swooped around and came looking for him 
 luke stumbled out of the bushes as the speeder was bearing down on him fullthrottle laser cannon firing luke ignited his lightsaber and stood his ground hisweapon deflected every bolt the scout fired at luke but the bike kept coming in afew moments the two would meet the bike accelerated even more intent on bodilyslicing the young jedi in half at the last moment though luke perfect timing like a master matador facing a a singlemighty slash of his lightsaber 
 the bike quickly began to shudder then pitch and roll in a second it was outof control entirely and in another second it was a rumbling billow of fire on the forestfloor 
 luke snuffed out his lightsaber and headed back to join the others 
 shuttle swung around the unfinished portion of the death star and settledfluidly into the main docking bay soundless bearings lowered the dark were his feet as they glided down the chilly steel chill with purpose werehis strides and swift 
 the main corridor was filled with courtiers all awaiting an audience with theemperor vader curled his lip at all pompous toadys in their velvetrobes and painted faces perfumed bishops passing notes and passing judgmentsamong who else cared oily bent low from theweight of jewelry still warm from a previous dying flesh easy violent menand women lusting to be tampered with 
 vader had no patience for such petty filth he passed them without a many of them would have paid dearly for felicitous glance from the high darklord 
 when he reached the elevator to the tower he found the door heavily armed royal guards flanked the shaft seemingly unaware presence out of the shadow an officer stepped forward directly in path preventing his further approach 
 you may not enter the officer said evenly 
 vader did not waste words he raised his hand fingers outstretched toward throat ineffably the officer began to choke his knees started face turned ashen 
 gasping for air he spoke again it is 
 like a spring vader released the man from his remote grip the again sank to the floor trembling he rubbed his neck gently 
 i will await his convenience vader said he turned and looked out of theview window endor glowed there floating black space almost as if itwere radiant from some internal source of energy he felt its pull like a magnet likea vacuum like a torch in dead night 
 han and chewie crouched opposite each other in the forest clearing being near the rest of the strike squad much as was around them in groups of twos and threes they all waited 
 even threepio was silent he sat beside artoo polishing his fingers for lack ofanything better to do the others checked their watches or their weapons as theafternoon sunlight ticked away 
 artoo sat unmoving except for the little radar screen that stuck out the top of hisblue and silver dome revolving scanning the forest he exuded the calm patienceof a utilized function a program being run 
 suddenly he beeped 
 threepio ceased his obsessive polishing and looked apprehensively into theforest coming he translated 
 the rest of the squad faced out weapons were raised a twig cracked beyondthe western perimeter no one breathed 
 with a weary stride luke stepped out of the foliage into the clearing allrelaxed lowered their guns luke was tired to care he plopped down on the harddirt beside solo and lay back with an exhausted groan 
 hard day huh kid han commented 
 luke sat up on one elbow smiling it seemed like an awful lot of effort andnoise just to nail a couple of imperial scouts and they even gotten to the reallytough part yet but han could still maintain his light tone it was a state of particular brand of charm luke hoped it never vanished from the we get to that generator he retorted in kind 
 solo looked around into the forest luke had just come from leia 
 face suddenly turned to one of concern she come back 
 i thought she was with you voice marginally rose in pitch and volume 
 we got split up luke explained he exchanged a grim look with solo thenboth of them slowly stood we better look for her 
 you want to rest a while han suggested he could see the fatigue face and wanted to spare him for the coming confrontation which wouldsurely take more strength than any of them had 
 i want to find leia he said softly 
 han nodded without argument he signaled to the rebel officer who wassecond in command of the strike squad the officer ran up and saluted 
 take the squad ahead ordered solo rendezvous at the shieldgenerator at 
 the officer saluted again and immediately organized the troops within aminute they were filing silently into the forest greatly relieved to be moving at last 
 luke chewbacca general solo and the two droids faced in the oppositedirection artoo led the way his revolving scanner sensing for all the parametersthat described his mistress and the others followed him into the woods 
 the first thing leia was aware of was her left elbow it was wet it was lyingin a pool of water getting quite soaked 
 she moved the elbow out of the water with a little splash revealing somethingelse in her entire arm when it moved for the time being she decided tokeep it still 
 the next thing to enter her consciousness were sounds the splash her elbowhad made the rustle of leaves an occasional bird chirp forest sounds with agrunt she took a short breath and noted the grunting sound 
 smells began to fill her nostrils next humid mossy smells leafy oxygen odor of a distant honey the vapor of rare flowers 
 taste came with taste of blood on her tongue she opened andclosed her mouth a few times to localize where the blood was coming from but instead the attempt only brought the recognition of new herhead in her neck in her back she started to move her arms again but this entaileda whole catalogue of new pains so once again she rested 
 next she allowed temperature to waft into her sensorium sun warmed thefingers of her right hand while the palm in shadow stayed cool a breeze draftedthe back of her legs her left hand pressed against the skin of her belly was warm 
 she feltawake 
 actually to witness the damage since seeing things made themreal and seeing her own broken body was not a reality she wanted she opened her eyes things were blurry here at ground browns and grays in the foreground becoming progressively brighter andgreener in the distance slowly things came into focus 
 slowly she saw the ewok 
 a strange small furry creature he stood three feet from face and no morethan three feet tall he had large dark curious brownish eyes and stubby completely covered head to foot with soft brown fur he looked likenothing so much as the stuffed baby wookiee doll leia remembered playing with as achild in face when he first saw the creature standing before her she thought itmerely a dream a childhood memory rising out of her addled brain 
 but this a dream it was an ewok and his name was wicket 
 now was he exclusively as leia focused further she could see a knifestrapped to his waist it was all he wore save for a thing leather mantle onlycovering his head 
 they watched each other unmoving for a long minute the ewok seemedpuzzled by the princess uncertain of what she was or what she intended at themoment leia intended to see if she could sit up 
 she sat up with a groan 
 the sound apparently frightened the little fluffball he rapidly stumbledbackward tripped and fell eeeeep he squeaked 
 leia scrutinized herself closely looking for signs of serious damage herclothes were torn she had cuts bruises and scrapes nothing seemedto be broken or irreparable on the other hand she had no idea where she groaned again 
 that did it for the ewok he jumped up grabbed a spear andheld it defensively in her direction warily he circled poking the pointed javelin ather clearly more fearful than aggressive 
 hey cut that out leia brushed the weapon away with annoyance that wasall she needed be skewered by a teddy bear more gently she not going to hurt you 
 gingerly she stood up testing her legs the ewok backed away with caution 
 be afraid leia tried to put reassurance into her voice i just want tosee what happened to my bike here she knew the more she talked in this tone themore at ease it would put the little creature moreover she knew if she was was doing okay 
 her legs were a little unsteady but she was able to walk slowly over to thecharred remains of the speeder now lying in a pile at the base of thepartially blackened tree 
 her movement was away from the ewok who like a skittish puppy took this asa safe sign and followed her to the wreckage leia picked the imperial laserpistol off the ground it was all that was left of him 
 i think i got off at the right time she muttered 
 the ewok appraised the scene with his big shiny eyes nodded shook his squeaked vociferously for several seconds 
 leia looked all around her at the dense forest then sat down with a sigh on afallen log she was at with the ewok now and they once again regardedeach other a little concerned trouble is sort of stuck here she i even know where here is 
 she put her head in her hands partly to mull over the situation partly to rubsome of the soreness from her temples wicket sat down beside her and mimickedher posture in paws elbows on let out a little sympatheticewok sigh 
 leia laughed appreciatively and scratched the small furry the ears he purred like a kitten 
 you happen to have a comlink on you by any chance she hoped maybe talking about it would give her an idea the ewokblinked a few he only gave her a mystified look leia smiled no iguess not 
 suddenly wicket froze his ears twitched and he sniffed the air he tilted hishead in an attitude of keen attention 
 what is it leia whispered something was obviously amiss then sheheard it a quiet snap in the bushes beyond a tentative rustling 
 all at once the ewok let out a loud terrified screech leia drew her behind the log wicket scurried beside her and squeezed under it a longsilence followed tense uncertain leia trained her senses on the near to fight 
 for all her readiness she expected the laser bolt to come from where off to the right it exploded in front of the log with a shower of light andpine needles she returned the fire short just as quicklysensed something behind her slowly she swiveled to find an imperial scoutstanding over her his weapon leveled at her head he reached out his hand for thepistol she held 
 take that he ordered 
 without warning a furry hand came out from under the log and jabbed the scoutin the leg with a knife the man howled in pain began jumping about on one foot 
 leia dove for his fallen laser pistol she rolled fired and hit the scout squarelyin the chest his heart 
 quickly the forest was quiet once more the noise and light swallowed up as ifthey had never been leia lay still where she was panting softly waiting for anotherattack none came 
 wicket poked his fuzzy head up from under the log and looked around eeeprrp scrp ooooh he mumbled in a tone of awe 
 leia hopped up ran all about the area crouched turned her head from side toside it seemed safe for the time being she motioned to her chubby new on better get out of here 
 as they moved into the thick flora wicket took the lead leia was unsure atfirst but he shrieked urgently at her and tugged her sleeve so she relinquishedcontrol to the odd little beast and followed him 
 she cast her mind adrift for a while letting her feet carry her nimbly alongamong the gargantuan trees she was struck suddenly not by the smallness of theewok who guided her but by her own smallness next to these trees they were tenthousand years old some of them and tall beyond sight they were temples to she championed they reached out to the rest of the universe she feltherself part of their greatness but also dwarfed by it 
 and lonely she felt lonely here in this forest of giants all her life among giants of her own people her father the great senator organa hermother then minister of education her peers and friends giants all 
 but these trees they were like mighty exclamation points announcing theirown preeminence they were here they were older than time they would behere long after leia was gone after the rebellion after the empire 
 and then she feel lonely again but felt a part again of these beings a part of them across time and space connected by the vibrant vitalforce of which 
 it was confusing a part and apart she grasp it she felt large andsmall brave and timid she felt like a tiny creative spark dancing about in the firesof lifedancing behind a furtive pudgy midget bear who kept beckoning her deeperinto the woods 
 it was this then that the alliance was fighting to creatures inmammoth forests helping scared brave princesses to safety leia wished her parentswere alive so she could tell them 
 lord vader stepped out of the elevator and stood at the entrance to the throneroom the hummed either side of the shaft casting an eerie glow on theroyal guards who waited there he marched resolutely down the walkway up thestairs and paused subserviently behind the throne he kneeled motionless 
 almost immediately he heard the voice rise rise and friend 
 vader rose as the throne swiveled around and the emperor faced him 
 they made eye contact from and a breath away across thatabyss vader responded my master a small rebel force has penetrated the shieldand landed on endor 
 yes i know there was no hint of surprise in his tone rather fulfillment 
 vader noted this then went on my son is with them 
 the brow furrowed less than a millimeter his voice remained slightly curious are you sure 
 i felt him my master it was almost a taunt he knew the emperor wasfrightened of young skywalker afraid of his power only together could vader andthe emperor hope to pull the jedi knight over to the dark side he said it his own singularity i felt him 
 strange that i have not the emperor murmured his eyes becoming both knew the force no one was infallible with its had everything to do with awareness with vision certainly vader and his sonwere more closely linked than was the emperor with young inaddition the emperor was now aware of a crosscurrent he read before abuckle in the force he quite understand i wonder if your feelings on thismatter are clear lord vader 
 they are clear my master he knew his presence it galled him andfueled him and lured him and howled in a voice of its own then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him emperor palpatinesaid simply as long as things were clear things were clear 
 he will come to me vader asked skeptically this was not what he felt hefelt drawn 
 of his own free will the emperor assured him it must be of his own freewill else all was lost a spirit could not be coerced into corruption it had to beseduced it had to participate activity it had to crave luke skywalker knewthese things and still he circled the black fire like a cat destinies could never beread with absolute skywalker would come that was clear i haveforeseen it his compassion for you will be his undoing compassion had alwaysbeen the weak belly of the jedi and forever would be it was the ultimatevulnerability the emperor had none the boy will come to you and you willthen bring him before me 
 vader bowed low as you wish 
 with casual malice the emperor dismissed the dark lord with grimanticipation vader strode out of the throne room to board the shuttle for endor 
 luke chewie han and threepio picked their way methodically through theundergrowth behind artoo whose antenna continued to revolve it was remarkablethe way the little droid was able to blaze a trail over jungle terrain like this but he didit without fuss the miniature cutting tools on his walkers and dome slicing neatlythrough anything too dense to push out of the way 
 artoo suddenly stopped causing some consternation on the part of his radar screen spun faster he clicked and whirred to himself then darted forwardwith an excited announcement vrrr deep dwp booooo dwee op 
 threepio raced behind him artoo says the rocket bikes are right 
 they broke into the clearing just ahead of the others but all stopped in a clumpon entering the charred debris of three speeder bikes was strewn around to mention the remains of some imperial scouts 
 they spread out to inspect the rubble little of note was evident except a tornpiece of jacket han held it soberly thinking 
 threepio spoke quietly sensor find no other trace of princess leia 
 i hope nowhere near here now han said to the trees he want toimagine her loss after all that had happened he simply believe it wouldend this way for her 
 looks like she ran into two of them luke said just to say something noneof them wanted to draw any conclusions 
 she seems to have done all right han responded somewhat tersely he wasaddressing luke but speaking to himself 
 only chewbacca seemed uninterested in the clearing in which they werestanding he stood facing the dense foliage beyond then wrinkled his nose sniffing 
 rahrr he shouted plunging into the thicket the others rushed after him 
 artoo whistled softly nervously 
 picking up what threepio snapped try to be more specific would you 
 the trees became significantly taller as the group pushed on not that it waspossible to see any higher but the girth of the trunks was increasingly massive therest of the forest was thinning a bit in the process making passage easier but givingthem the distinct sense that they were shrinking it was an ominous feeling 
 all at once the undergrowth gave way again to yet another open space at thecenter of this clearing a huge several shanks of raw meat the searchers stared thencautiously walked to the stake 
 this threepio voiced the collective question 
 nose was going wild in some kind of olfactory delirium he heldhimself back as long as he could but was finally unable to resist he reached out forone of the slabs of meat 
 no wait shouted luke 
 but it was too late the moment the meat was pulled from the stake a huge netsprang up all around the adventurers instantly hoisting them high above the a twisting jumble of arms and legs 
 artoo whistled was programmed to hate being thewookiee bayed his regret 
 han peeled a hairy paw away from his mouth spitting fur great work always thinking with your stomach 
 take it easy called luke just figure out how to get out of this tried but was unable to free his arms one locked behind him through the net onepinned to leg can anyone reach my lightsaber 
 artoo was bottommost he extended his cutting appendage and began clippingthe loops of the vinery net 
 solo meantime was trying to squeeze his arm past threepio trying to stretch toreach the lightsaber hanging at waist they settled jerkily as artoo cutthrough another piece of mesh leaving han pressed face to face with the protocoldroid 
 out of the way off of 
 how do you think i feel threepio charged there was no protocol in asituation like this 
 i really han began but suddenly artoo cut through the last link andthe entire group crashed out of the net to the ground as they gradually regainedtheir senses sat up checked to make certain the others were all safe one by one theyrealized they were surrounded by twenty furry little creatures all wearing soft leatherhoods or caps all brandishing spears 
 one came close to han pushing a long spear in his face screeching eeee wk 
 solo knocked the weapon aside with a curt directive point that thingsomewhere else 
 a second ewok became alarmed and lunged at han again he deflected thespear but in the process got cut on the arm 
 luke reached for his lightsaber but just then a third ewok ran forward pushingthe more aggressive ones out of the way and shrieked a long string of seeminginvective at them in a decidedly scolding tone at this luke decided to hold off onhis lightsaber 
 han was wounded and angry though he started to holster with a be all right he added never confuse ability with appearance benused to tell actions with motivations luke was uncertain of these littlefurries but he had a feeling 
 han held his arm and held his peace as the ewoks swarmed all their weapons luke even relinquished his lightsaber chewiegrowled suspiciously 
 artoo and threepio were just extracting themselves from the collapsed net asthe ewoks chattered excitedly to each other 
 luke turned to the gold droid threepio can you understand what 
 threepio rose from the mesh trap feeling himself for dents or rattles oh myhead he complained 
 at the sight of his fully upright body the ewoks began squeaking amongthemselves pointing and gesticulating 
 threepio spoke to the one who appeared to be the leader chree breeb a shurrdu 
 bloh wreee dbleeop weeschhreee answered the fuzzy beast 
 du wee sheess 
 reeop glwah wrrripsh 
 shreee 
 suddenly one of the ewoks dropped his spear with a little gasp and prostratedhimself before the shiny droid in another moment all the ewoks followed looked at his friends with a slightly embarrassed shrug 
 chewie let out a puzzled bark artoo whirred speculatively luke and hanregarded the battalion of kowtowing ewoks in wonder 
 then at some invisible signal from one of their group the small creatures beganto chant in unison eekee whoh eekee whoh rheakee rheekee whoh 
 han looked at threepio with total disbelief you say to them 
 hello i think threepio replied almost apologetically he hastened to could be mistaken using a very primitive dialecti believe they think sort of god 
 chewbacca and artoo thought that was very funny they spent several secondshysterically barking and whistling before they finally managed to quiet had to wipe a tear from his eye 
 han just shook his head with a look of patience well howabout using your diving influence to get us out of this he suggested solicitously 
 threepio pulled himself up to his full height and spoke with unrelentingdecorum i beg your pardon captain solo but that be proper 
 proper solo roared he always knew this pompous droid was going to gotoo far with him one this might well be the day 
 against my programming to impersonate a deity he replied to solo as ifnothing so obvious needed explanation 
 han moved threateningly toward the protocol droid his fingers itching to pull aplug listen you pile of bolts if you he got no farther as fifteen ewokspears were thrust menacingly in his face just kidding he smiled affably 
 the procession of ewoks wound its way slowly into the somber creatures inching through a maze the sun had nearlyset now and the long shadows made the cavernous domain even moreimposing than before yet the ewoks seemed well at home turning down eachdense corridor of vines with precision 
 on their shoulders they carried their four chewbacca to long poles wrapped around and around with vines immobilizing themas if they were wriggling larvae in coarse leafy cocoons 
 behind the captives threepio borne on a of branches in theshape of a carried high upon the shoulders of the lowly ewoks like aroyal potentate he perused the mighty forest through which they carried lavender sunset glowing between the vinery the exotic flowers starting toclose the ageless trees the glistening knew that no one before him hadever appreciated these things in just precisely the manner he was now no one elsehad his sensors his circuits his programs his memory so in some realway he was the creator of this little universe its images and colors 
 and it was good

 kutuzov fell back toward vienna destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn at braunau and traun near linz on october the russian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russian baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge 
 it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and then suddenly spread out in the sunlight objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down below the little town could be seen with its white houses its cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an island and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the danube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns the horse patrols could be discerned 
 among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through his fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on their knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass 
 yes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool a fine place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitski was saying 
 thank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance a lovely place we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendid house 
 look prince said another who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside see our infantrymen have already got there look there in the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval 
 so they will said nesvitski no but what i should like added he munching a pie in his handsome mouth would be to slip in over there 
 he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed and gleamed 
 that would be fine gentlemen 
 the officers laughed 
 just to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girls among them on my word give five years of my life for it 
 they must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers laughing 
 meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general who looked through his field glass 
 yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is be fired on at the crossing and why are they dawdling there 
 on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from their battery a cloud arose then came the distant report of a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing 
 nesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling 
 would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said 
 a bad business said the general without answering him our men have been wasting time 
 i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitski 
 yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected 
 very good answered nesvitski 
 he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle 
 really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill 
 now then see how far it will carry captain just try said the general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the time 
 crew to your guns commanded the officer 
 in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading 
 one came the command 
 number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke showing the spot where it burst 
 the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly visible as if but a throw away and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression

 meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general who looked through his field glass 
 yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is be fired on at the crossing and why are they dawdling there 
 on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from their battery a cloud arose then came the distant report of a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing 
 nesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling 
 would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said 
 a bad business said the general without answering him our men have been wasting time 
 i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitski 
 yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected 
 very good answered nesvitski 
 he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle 
 really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill 
 now then see how far it will carry captain just try said the general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the time 
 crew to your guns commanded the officer 
 in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading 
 one came the command 
 number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke showing the spot where it burst 
 the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly visible as if but a throw away and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression

 chapter 
 
 for some days after that evening mr heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals yet he would not consent formally to exclude hareton and cathy he had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings choosing rather to absent himself and eating once in hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him 
 one night after the family were in bed i heard him go downstairs and out at the front door i did not hear him and in the morning i found he was still away we were in april then the weather was sweet and warm the grass as green as showers and sun could make it and the two dwarf apple trees near the southern wall in full bloom after breakfast catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir trees at the end of the house and she beguiled hareton who had perfectly recovered from his accident to dig and arrange her little garden which was shifted to that corner by the influence of complaints i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around and the beautiful soft blue overhead when my young lady who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border returned only half laden and informed us that mr heathcliff was coming in and he spoke to me she added with a perplexed countenance 
 what did he say asked hareton 
 he told me to begone as fast as i could she answered but he looked so different from his usual look that i stopped a moment to stare at him 
 how he inquired 
 why almost bright and cheerful no almost much excited and wild and glad she replied 
 night walking amuses him then i remarked affecting a careless manner in reality as surprised as she was and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master looking glad would not be an everyday spectacle i framed an excuse to go in heathcliff stood at the open door he was pale and he trembled yet certainly he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes that altered the aspect of his whole face 
 will you have some breakfast i said you must be hungry rambling about all night i wanted to discover where he had been but i did not like to ask directly 
 no not hungry he answered averting his head and speaking rather contemptuously as if he guessed i was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour 
 i felt perplexed i know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition 
 i think it right to wander out of doors i observed instead of being in bed it is not wise at any rate this moist season i dare say catch a bad cold or a fever you have something the matter with you now 
 nothing but what i can bear he replied and with the greatest pleasure provided leave me alone get in and annoy me 
 i obeyed and in passing i noticed he breathed as fast as a cat 
 yes i reflected to myself we shall have a fit of illness i cannot conceive what he has been doing 
 that noon he sat down to dinner with us and received a plate from my hands as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting 
 neither cold nor fever nelly he remarked in allusion to my speech and ready to do justice to the food you give me 
 he took his knife and fork and was going to commence eating when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct he laid them on the table looked eagerly towards the window then rose and went out we saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal and earnshaw said go and ask why he would not dine he thought we had grieved him some way 
 well is he coming cried catherine when her cousin returned 
 nay he answered but not angry he seemed rare and pleased indeed only i made him impatient by speaking to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wondered how i could want the company of anybody else 
 i set his plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he when the room was clear in no degree calmer the same was of joy under his black brows the same bloodless hue and his teeth visible now and then in a kind of smile his frame shivering not as one shivers with chill or weakness but as a cord strong thrilling rather than trembling 
 i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should and i exclaimed 
 have you heard any good news mr heathcliff you look uncommonly animated 
 where should good news come from to me he said animated with hunger and seemingly i must not eat 
 your dinner is here i returned why you get it 
 i want it now he muttered hastily wait till supper and nelly once for all let me beg you to warn hareton and the other away from me i wish to be troubled by nobody i wish to have this place to myself 
 is there some new reason for this banishment i inquired tell me why you are so queer mr heathcliff where were you last night not putting the question through idle curiosity but 
 you are putting the question through very idle curiosity he interrupted with a laugh yet answer it last night i was on the threshold of hell today i am within sight of my heaven i have my eyes on it hardly three feet to sever me and now better go neither see nor hear anything to frighten you if you refrain from prying 
 having swept the hearth and wiped the table i departed more perplexed than ever 
 he did not quit the house again that afternoon and no one intruded on his solitude till at eight i deemed it proper though unsummoned to carry a candle and his supper to him he was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice but not looking out his face was turned to the interior gloom the fire had smouldered to ashes the room was filled with the damp mild air of the cloudy evening and so still that not only the murmur of the beck down gimmerton was distinguishable but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles or through the large stones which it could not cover i uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate and commenced shutting the casements one after another till i came to his 
 must i close this i asked in order to rouse him for he would not stir 
 the light flashed on his features as i spoke oh mr lockwood i cannot express what a terrible start i got by the momentary view those deep black eyes that smile and ghastly paleness it appeared to me not mr heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candle bend towards the wall and it left me in darkness 
 yes close it he replied in his familiar voice there that is pure awkwardness why did you hold the candle horizontally be quick and bring another 
 i hurried out in a foolish state of dread and said to joseph the master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire 
 for i dare not go in myself again just then 
 joseph rattled some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immediately with the supper tray in his other hand explaining that mr heathcliff was going to bed and he wanted nothing to eat till morning we heard him mount the stairs directly he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber but turned into that with the panelled bed its window as i mentioned before is wide enough for anybody to get through and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion of which he had rather we had no suspicion 
 is he a ghoul or a vampire i mused i had read of such hideous incarnate demons and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy and watched him grow to youth and followed him almost through his whole course and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror but where did he come from the little dark thing harboured by a good man to his bane muttered superstition as i dozed into unconsciousness and i began half dreaming to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him and repeating my waking meditations i tracked his existence over again with grim variations at last picturing his death and funeral of which all i can remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument and consulting the sexton about it and as he had no surname and we could not tell his age we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word heathcliff that came true we were if you enter the kirkyard read on his headstone only that and the date of his death 
 dawn restored me to common sense i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window there were none he has stayed at and be all right today i prepared breakfast for the household as was my usual custom but told hareton and catherine to get theirs ere the master came down for he lay late they preferred taking it out of doors under the trees and i set a little table to accommodate them 
 on my i found mr heathcliff below he and joseph were conversing about some farming business he gave clear minute directions concerning the matter discussed but he spoke rapidly and turned his head continually aside and had the same excited expression even more exaggerated when joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose and i put a basin of coffee before him he drew it nearer and then rested his arms on the table and looked at the opposite wall as i supposed surveying one particular portion up and down with glittering restless eyes and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together 
 come now i exclaimed pushing some bread against his hand eat and drink that while it is hot it has been waiting near an hour 
 he notice me and yet he smiled rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so 
 mr heathcliff master i cried for sake stare as if you saw an unearthly vision 
 for sake shout so loud he replied turn round and tell me are we by ourselves 
 of course was my answer of course we are 
 still i involuntarily obeyed him as if i were not quite sure with a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things and leant forward to gaze more at his ease 
 now i perceived he was not looking at the wall for when i regarded him alone it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards distance and whatever it was it communicated apparently both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes at least the anguished yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested that idea the fancied object was not fixed either his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence and even in speaking to me were never weaned away i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread his fingers clenched before they reached it and remained on the table forgetful of their aim 
 i sat a model of patience trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation till he grew irritable and asking why i would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals and saying that on the next occasion i wait i might set the things down and go having uttered these words he left the house slowly sauntered down the garden path and disappeared through the gate 
 the hours crept anxiously by another evening came i did not retire to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he returned after midnight and instead of going to bed shut himself into the room beneath i listened and tossed about and finally dressed and descended it was too irksome to lie up there harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings 
 i distinguished mr step restlessly measuring the floor and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration resembling a groan he muttered detached words also the only one i could catch was the name of catherine coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering and spoken as one would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of his soul i had not courage to walk straight into the apartment but i desired to divert him from his reverie and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire stirred it and began to scrape the cinders it drew him forth sooner than i expected he opened the door immediately and said 
 nelly come it morning come in with your light 
 it is striking four i answered you want a candle to take upstairs you might have lit one at this fire 
 no i wish to go upstairs he said come in and kindle me a fire and do anything there is to do about the room 
 i must blow the coals red first before i can carry any i replied getting a chair and the bellows 
 he roamed to and fro meantime in a state approaching distraction his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between 
 when day breaks send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiries of him while i can bestow a thought on those matters and while i can act calmly i have not written my will yet and how to leave my property i cannot determine i wish i could annihilate it from the face of the earth 
 i would not talk so mr heathcliff i interposed let your will be a while be spared to repent of your many injustices yet i never expected that your nerves would be disordered they are at present marvellously so however and almost entirely through your own fault the way passed these three last days might knock up a titan do take some food and some repose you need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both your cheeks are hollow and your eyes bloodshot like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep 
 it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he replied i assure you it is through no settled designs do both as soon as i possibly can but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within length of the shore i must reach it first and then rest well never mind mr green as to repenting of my injustices done no injustice and i repent of nothing too happy and yet not happy enough my bliss kills my body but does not satisfy itself 
 happy master i cried strange happiness if you would hear me without being angry i might offer some advice that would make you happier 
 what is that he asked give it 
 you are aware mr heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish unchristian life and probably hardly had a bible in your hands during all that period you must have forgotten the contents of the book and you may not have space to search it now could it be hurtful to send for minister of any denomination it does not matter explain it and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts and how unfit you will be for its heaven unless a change takes place before you die 
 rather obliged than angry nelly he said for you remind me of the manner that i desire to be buried in it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening you and hareton may if you please accompany me and mind particularly to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins no minister need come nor need anything be said over tell you i have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncovered by me 
 and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast and died by that means and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk i said shocked at his godless indifference how would you like it 
 they do that he replied if they did you must have me removed secretly and if you neglect it you shall prove practically that the dead are not annihilated 
 as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den and i breathed freer but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the house he wanted somebody with him i declined telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone 
 i believe you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh something too horrible to live under a decent roof then turning to catherine who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he added half you come chuck not hurt you no to you made myself worse than the devil well there is one who shrink from my company by god relentless oh damn it unutterably too much for flesh and blood to mine 
 he solicited the society of no one more at dusk he went into his chamber through the whole night and far into the morning we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself hareton was anxious to enter but i bade him fetch mr kenneth and he should go in and see him when he came and i requested admittance and tried to open the door i found it locked and heathcliff bid us be damned he was better and would be left alone so the doctor went away 
 the following evening was very wet indeed it poured down till and as i took my morning walk round the house i observed the window swinging open and the rain driving straight in he cannot be in bed i thought those showers would drench him through he must either be up or out but make no more ado go boldly and look 
 having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key i ran to unclose the panels for the chamber was vacant quickly pushing them aside i peeped in mr heathcliff was on his back his eyes met mine so keen and fierce i started and then he seemed to smile i could not think him dead but his face and throat were washed with rain the bedclothes dripped and he was perfectly still the lattice flapping to and fro had grazed one hand that rested on the sill no blood trickled from the broken skin and when i put my fingers to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark 
 i hasped the window i combed his black long hair from his forehead i tried to close his eyes to extinguish if possible that frightful lifelike gaze of exultation before anyone else beheld it they would not shut they seemed to sneer at my attempts and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too taken with another fit of cowardice i cried out for joseph joseph shuffled up and made a noise but resolutely refused to meddle with him 
 th harried off his soul he cried and he muh hev his carcass intuh t bargain for aw care ech what a wicked un he looks girning at death and the old sinner grinned in mockery i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed but suddenly composing himself he fell on his knees and raised his hands and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights 
 i felt stunned by the awful event and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness but poor hareton the most wronged was the only one that really suffered much he sat by the corpse all night weeping in bitter earnest he pressed its hand and kissed the sarcastic savage face that everyone else shrank from contemplating and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart though it be tough as tempered steel 
 mr kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days fearing it might lead to trouble and then i am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose it was the consequence of his strange illness not the cause 
 we buried him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wished earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carry the coffin comprehended the whole attendance the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave we stayed to see it covered hareton with a streaming face dug green sods and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly but the country folk if you ask them would swear on the bible that he walks there are those who speak to having met him near the church and on the moor and even in this house idle tales say and so say i yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago i was going to the grange one dark evening threatening just at the turn of the heights i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him he was crying terribly and i supposed the lambs were skittish and would not be guided 
 the matter my little man i asked 
 heathcliff and a woman yonder under t nab he blubbered un i darnut pass em 
 i saw nothing but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down he probably raised the phantoms from thinking as he traversed the moors alone on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat yet still i like being out in the dark now and i like being left by myself in this grim house i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the grange 
 they are going to the grange then i said 
 yes answered mrs dean is soon as they are married and that will be on new day 
 and who will live here then 
 why joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a lad to keep him company they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up 
 for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it i observed 
 no mr lockwood said nelly shaking her head i believe the dead are at peace but it is not right to speak of them with levity 
 at that moment the garden gate swung to the ramblers were returning 
 they are afraid of nothing i grumbled watching their approach through the window together they would brave satan and all his legions 
 as they stepped on to the doorstones and halted to take a last look at the more correctly at each other by her felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again and pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs dean and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his gay indiscretions had he not fortunately recognized me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet 
 my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk when beneath its walls i perceived decay had made progress even in seven months many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass and slates jutted off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms 
 i sought and soon discovered the three headstones on the slope next the moor the middle one grey and half buried in heath edgar only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot still bare 
 i lingered round them under that benign sky watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass and wondered how anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth

 it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he replied i assure you it is through no settled designs do both as soon as i possibly can but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within length of the shore i must reach it first and then rest well never mind mr green as to repenting of my injustices done no injustice and i repent of nothing too happy and yet not happy enough my bliss kills my body but does not satisfy itself 
 happy master i cried strange happiness if you would hear me without being angry i might offer some advice that would make you happier 
 what is that he asked give it 
 you are aware mr heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish unchristian life and probably hardly had a bible in your hands during all that period you must have forgotten the contents of the book and you may not have space to search it now could it be hurtful to send for minister of any denomination it does not matter explain it and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts and how unfit you will be for its heaven unless a change takes place before you die 
 rather obliged than angry nelly he said for you remind me of the manner that i desire to be buried in it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening you and hareton may if you please accompany me and mind particularly to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins no minister need come nor need anything be said over tell you i have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncovered by me 
 and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast and died by that means and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk i said shocked at his godless indifference how would you like it 
 they do that he replied if they did you must have me removed secretly and if you neglect it you shall prove practically that the dead are not annihilated 
 as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den and i breathed freer but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the house he wanted somebody with him i declined telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone 
 i believe you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh something too horrible to live under a decent roof then turning to catherine who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he added half you come chuck not hurt you no to you made myself worse than the devil well there is one who shrink from my company by god relentless oh damn it unutterably too much for flesh and blood to mine 
 he solicited the society of no one more at dusk he went into his chamber through the whole night and far into the morning we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself hareton was anxious to enter but i bade him fetch mr kenneth and he should go in and see him when he came and i requested admittance and tried to open the door i found it locked and heathcliff bid us be damned he was better and would be left alone so the doctor went away 
 the following evening was very wet indeed it poured down till and as i took my morning walk round the house i observed the window swinging open and the rain driving straight in he cannot be in bed i thought those showers would drench him through he must either be up or out but make no more ado go boldly and look 
 having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key i ran to unclose the panels for the chamber was vacant quickly pushing them aside i peeped in mr heathcliff was on his back his eyes met mine so keen and fierce i started and then he seemed to smile i could not think him dead but his face and throat were washed with rain the bedclothes dripped and he was perfectly still the lattice flapping to and fro had grazed one hand that rested on the sill no blood trickled from the broken skin and when i put my fingers to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark 
 i hasped the window i combed his black long hair from his forehead i tried to close his eyes to extinguish if possible that frightful lifelike gaze of exultation before anyone else beheld it they would not shut they seemed to sneer at my attempts and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too taken with another fit of cowardice i cried out for joseph joseph shuffled up and made a noise but resolutely refused to meddle with him 
 th harried off his soul he cried and he muh hev his carcass intuh t bargain for aw care ech what a wicked un he looks girning at death and the old sinner grinned in mockery i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed but suddenly composing himself he fell on his knees and raised his hands and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights 
 i felt stunned by the awful event and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness but poor hareton the most wronged was the only one that really suffered much he sat by the corpse all night weeping in bitter earnest he pressed its hand and kissed the sarcastic savage face that everyone else shrank from contemplating and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart though it be tough as tempered steel 
 mr kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days fearing it might lead to trouble and then i am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose it was the consequence of his strange illness not the cause 
 we buried him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wished earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carry the coffin comprehended the whole attendance the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave we stayed to see it covered hareton with a streaming face dug green sods and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly but the country folk if you ask them would swear on the bible that he walks there are those who speak to having met him near the church and on the moor and even in this house idle tales say and so say i yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago i was going to the grange one dark evening threatening just at the turn of the heights i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him he was crying terribly and i supposed the lambs were skittish and would not be guided 
 the matter my little man i asked 
 heathcliff and a woman yonder under t nab he blubbered un i darnut pass em 
 i saw nothing but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down he probably raised the phantoms from thinking as he traversed the moors alone on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat yet still i like being out in the dark now and i like being left by myself in this grim house i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the grange 
 they are going to the grange then i said 
 yes answered mrs dean is soon as they are married and that will be on new day 
 and who will live here then 
 why joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a lad to keep him company they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up 
 for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it i observed 
 no mr lockwood said nelly shaking her head i believe the dead are at peace but it is not right to speak of them with levity 
 at that moment the garden gate swung to the ramblers were returning 
 they are afraid of nothing i grumbled watching their approach through the window together they would brave satan and all his legions 
 as they stepped on to the doorstones and halted to take a last look at the more correctly at each other by her felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again and pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs dean and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his gay indiscretions had he not fortunately recognized me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet 
 my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk when beneath its walls i perceived decay had made progress even in seven months many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass and slates jutted off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms 
 i sought and soon discovered the three headstones on the slope next the moor the middle one grey and half buried in heath edgar only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot still bare 
 i lingered round them under that benign sky watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass and wondered how anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth

 chapter 
 
 
 though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort jo still found time for literary labors the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best she saw that money conferred power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than life 
 the dream of filling home with comforts giving beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years most cherished castle in the air 
 the experience had seemed to open a way which might after long traveling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chateau en espagne but the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the treasures if i remember rightly but the up again and take another spirit was as strong in jo as in jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags 
 she took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even america read rubbish she told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to mr dashwood editor of the weekly volcano she had never read sartor resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners so she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigar smoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance somewhat daunted by this reception jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment 
 excuse me i was looking for the weekly volcano office i wished to see mr dashwood 
 down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep feeling that she must get through the matter somehow jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion 
 a friend of mine desired me to as an like your glad to write more if this suits 
 while she blushed and blundered mr dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages 
 not a first attempt i take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a sign of a novice 
 no sir she has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the blarneystone banner 
 oh did she and mr dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots well you can leave it if you like more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but run my eye over it and give you an answer next week 
 now jo did not like to leave it for mr dashwood suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week 
 when she went again mr dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced mr dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and mr dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first 
 take this editors never say i if you object to a few alterations too long but omitting the passages marked will make it just the right said in a businesslike tone 
 jo hardly knew her own ms again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender patent might on being asked to cut off her legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral she had carefully put in as ballast for much been stricken out 
 but sir i thought every story should have some sort of a moral so i took care to have a few of my sinners repent 
 mr editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could 
 people want to be amused not preached at you know morals sell nowadays which was not quite a correct statement by the way 
 you think it would do with these alterations then 
 yes a new plot and pretty well worked good and so on was mr affable reply 
 what do is what compensation began jo not exactly knowing how to express herself 
 oh yes well we give from to thirty for things of this sort pay when it comes out returned mr dashwood as if that point had escaped him such trifles do escape the editorial mind it is said 
 very well you can have it said jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the work even seemed good pay 
 shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success 
 well look at it promise to take it tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral what name would your friend like to put on it in a careless tone 
 none at all if you please she wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said jo blushing in spite of herself 
 
 just as she likes of course the tale will be out next week will you call for the money or shall i send it asked mr dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be 
 call good morning sir 
 as she departed mr dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark poor and proud as usual but do 
 following mr directions and making mrs northbury her model jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking 
 like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and mr dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch 
 she soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home she had a feeling that father and mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories mr dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word 
 she thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her secret 
 but mr dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons she studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her she delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed she thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a character she was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us 
 she was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when jo most needed hers she got it 
 i know whether the study of shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections 
 mr bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied proceeding which would have much surprised him had he know it for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit 
 why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first he was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth he was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet everyone was his friend no longer young but as as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle if he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others the pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words 
 his very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable his apacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath his rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full his very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other 
 it said jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher who shoveled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of bhaer 
 jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the professor added much to her regard for him he never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him he never spoke of himself and in a conversation with miss norton divulged the pleasing fact from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr bhaer had never told it she felt proud to know that he was an honored professor in berlin though only a poor in america and his homely life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner miss norton had the entree into most society which jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her the solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on jo and the professor she took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities 
 jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off but her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance turning as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de staels of the age who looked daggers at another corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible the scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the british nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party 
 before the evening was half over jo felt so completely disillusioned that she sat down in a corner to recover herself mr bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess the conversations were miles beyond comprehension but she enjoyed it though kant and hegel were unknown gods the subjective and objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over it dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only god jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday 
 she looked round to see how the professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimest expression she had ever seen him wear he shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs 
 now mr bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken as he glanced from jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand 
 he bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of eloquence which made his broken english musical and his plain face beautiful he had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo the old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new god was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact she felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when mr bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him 
 she did neither but she remembered the scene and gave the professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent she began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and good will then her friend friedrich bhaer was not only good but great 
 this belief strengthened daily she valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near to losing everything it all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the professor came in to give jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head which tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off 
 evident he look in his glass before coming down thought jo with a smile as he said goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the death of wallenstein 
 she said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a german read schiller is rather an absorbing occupation after the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for jo was in a gay mood that night and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment the professor know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible 
 mees marsch for what do you laugh in your face haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad 
 how can i be respectful sir when you forget to take your hat off said jo 
 lifting his hand to his head the professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol 
 ah i see him now it is that imp tina who makes me a fool with my cap well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him 
 but the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because mr bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with great disgust i wish these papers did not come in the house they are not for children to see nor young people to read it is not well and i haf no patience with those who make this harm 
 jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villian and a viper she did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the volcano it was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied he knew that jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him he did not say to himself it is none of my business no right to say anything as many people would have done he only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from love and care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle all this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely 
 yes you are right to put it from you i do not think that good young girls should see such things they are made pleasant to some but i would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash 
 all may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it i see any harm in supplying it many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin 
 there is a demand for whisky but i think you and i do not care to sell it if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest they haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it no they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing 
 mr bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney 
 i should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the professor coming back with a relieved air 
 jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute then she thought consolingly to herself mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so i be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face shall we go on sir be very good and proper now 
 i shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words weekly volcano were printed in large type on her forehead 
 as soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories being a little shortsighted mr bhaer sometimes used eye glasses and jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book now she seemed to have on the mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay 
 they are trash and will soon be worse trash if i go on for each is more sensational than the last gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money i know so for i read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr bhaer got hold of them 
 jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze 
 yes the best place for such inflammable nonsense better burn the house down i suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the demon of the jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes 
 but when nothing remained of all her three work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages 
 i think i done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently i almost wish i any conscience so inconvenient if i care about doing right and feel uncomfortable when doing wrong i should get on capitally i help wishing sometimes that mother and father been so particular about such things 
 ah jo instead of wishing that thank god that father and mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood 
 jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of mrs sherwood miss edgeworth and hannah more and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it she had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century she sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with mr dashwood that morals sell 
 then she tried a story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it the only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief but much as she liked to write for children jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular sabbath school nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues so nothing came of these trials land jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility 
 i know anything wait until i do before i try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if i do better honest at least which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good 
 while these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but professor bhaer he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant 
 he helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons besides german and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life 
 it was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave mrs kirke till june everyone seemed sorry when the time came the children were inconsolable and mr hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind 
 going home ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening 
 she was going early so she bade them all goodbye overnight and when his turn came she said warmly now sir you forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you never forgive you if you do for i want them all to know my friend 
 do you shall i come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see 
 yes come next month laurie graduates then and enjoy commencement as something new 
 that is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone 
 yes my boy teddy very proud of him and should like you to see him 
 jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another something in mr face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew if it had not been for tina on her knee she know what would have become of her fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the professor did not see it but he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially 
 i fear i shall not make the time for that but i wish the friend much success and you all happiness gott bless you and with that he shook hands warmly shouldered tina and went away 
 but after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart once when he remembered jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find 
 it is not for me i must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan then as if reproach ing himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow took down his meerschaum and opened his plato 
 he did his best and did it manfully but i think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home 
 early as it was he was at the station next morning to see jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought well the gone and written no books earned no fortune but made a friend worth having and try to keep him all my life
