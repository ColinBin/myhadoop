 kitty writes to me that nothing she longs for so much as quiet and solitude dolly said after the silence that had followed 
 and how is she better levin asked in agitation 
 thank god quite well again i never believed her lungs were affected 
 oh very glad said levin and dolly fancied she saw something touching helpless in his face as he said this and looked silently into her face 
 let me ask you konstantin dmitrievich said darya alexandrovna smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile why are you angry with kitty 
 i not angry with her said levin 
 yes you are why was it you did not come to see us or them when you were in moscow 
 darya alexandrovna he said blushing up to the roots of his hair i wonder really that with your kind heart you feel this how it is you feel no pity for me if nothing else when you know 
 what do i know 
 you know that i proposed and was refused said levin and all the tenderness he had been feeling for kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered 
 what makes you suppose i know 
 because everybody knows it 
 just where you are mistaken i did not know it though i had guessed it was so 
 well now you know it 
 all i knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable and that she begged me never to speak of it and if she would not tell me she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else but what did pass between you tell me 
 i have told you 
 when was it 
 when i was at their house the last time 
 do you know said darya alexandrovna i am awfully awfully sorry for her you suffer only from pride 
 perhaps so said levin but 
 she interrupted him 
 but she poor girl i am awfully awfully sorry for her now i see it all 
 well darya alexandrovna you must excuse me he said getting up darya alexandrovna till we meet again 
 no wait a minute she said clutching him by the sleeve wait a minute sit down 
 please please let us talk of this he said sitting down and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried 
 if i did not like you she said and tears came into her eyes if i did not know you as i do know you 
 the feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more rose up and took possession of heart 
 yes i understand it all now said darya alexandrovna you understand it for you men who are free and make your own choice always clear whom you love but a in a position of suspense with all a or modesty a girl who sees you men from afar who takes everything on trust a girl may have and often has such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say 
 yes if the heart does not speak 
 no the heart does speak but just consider you men have views about a girl you come to the house you make friends you criticize you wait to see if you have found what you love and then when you are sure you love her you propose 
 well not quite it 
 anyway you propose when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from but a girl is not asked she is expected to make her choice and yet she cannot choose she can only answer yes or no 
 yes to choose between me and vronsky thought levin and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again and only weighed on his heart and set it aching 
 darya alexandrovna he said how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other not love the choice has been made and so much the better and there can be no repetition 
 ah pride pride said darya alexandrovna as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know at the time when you proposed to kitty she was just in a position in which she could not answer she was in doubt doubt between you and vronsky him she was seeing every day and you she had not seen for a long while supposing she had been older i for instance in her place could have felt no doubt i always disliked him and my dislike proved to be justified 
 levin recalled answer she had said no that cannot be 
 darya alexandrovna he said dryly i appreciate your confidence in me i believe you are making a mistake but whether i am right or wrong that pride you so despise makes any thought of katerina alexandrovna out of the question for me you understand utterly out of the question 
 i will only say one thing more you know that i am speaking of my sister whom i love as i love my own children i say she cared for you all i meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing 
 i know said levin jumping up you only knew how you are hurting me just as if a child of yours were dead and they were to say to you he would have been like this and like that and he might have lived and how happy you would have been in him but dead dead dead 
 how absurd you are said darya alexandrovna looking with mournful tenderness at excitement yes i see it all more and more clearly she went on musingly so you come to see us then when here 
 no i come of course i avoid meeting katerina alexandrovna but as far as i can i will try to save her the annoyance of my presence 
 you are very very absurd repeated darya alexandrovna looking with tenderness into his face very well then let it be as though we had not spoken of this what have you come for tania she said in french to the little girl who had come in 
 my spade mamma 
 i speak french and you must too 
 the little girl tried to say it in french but could not remember the french for spade the mother prompted her and then told her in french where to look for the spade and this made a disagreeable impression on levin 
 everything in darya house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before 
 and why does she talk french with the children he thought how unnatural and false it is and the children feel it so learning french and unlearning sincerity he thought to himself unaware that darya alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already and yet even at the cost of some loss of sincerity believed it necessary to teach her children french in that way 
 but why are you going do stay a little 
 levin stayed to tea but his good humor had vanished and he felt ill at ease 
 after tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in and when he came back he found darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed with a troubled face and tears in her eyes while levin had been outside an incident had occurred which had all at once shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day and her pride in her children grisha and tania had been fighting over a ball darya alexandrovna hearing a scream in the nursery ran in and saw a terrible sight tania was pulling hair while he with a face hideous with rage was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her something snapped in darya heart when she saw this it was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life she felt that these children of hers that she was so proud of were not merely most ordinary but positively bad children with coarse brutal propensities wicked children 
 she could not talk or think of anything else and she could not help speaking to levin of her misery 
 levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her saying that it showed nothing bad that all children fight but even as he said it he was thinking in his heart no i be artificial and talk french with my children but my children be like that all one has to do is not spoil children not to distort their nature and be delightful no my children be like that 
 he said and drove away and she did not try to detain him

 chapter 
 
 in the middle of july the elder of the village on estate about twenty verstas from pokrovskoe came to levin to report about the hay and how things were going there the chief source of income on his estate was from the water meadows in former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the dessiatina when levin took over the management of the estate he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more and he fixed the price at roubles the dessiatina the peasants would not give that price and as levin suspected kept off other purchasers then levin had driven over himself and arranged to have the grass cut partly by hired labor partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop the peasants of this village put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement but it was carried out and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double two years ago and the previous year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement and the hay had been cut on the same system this year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut and that fearing rain he had invited the countinghouse clerk over had divided the crop in his presence and had raked together eleven stacks as the share from the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division without asking leave from the whole tone of the peasant levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter 
 arriving by dinnertime at the village and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his the husband of his wet nurse levin went to see the old man in his beehouse wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay parmenich a talkative comely old man gave levin a very warm welcome showed him all he was doing told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year but gave vague and unwilling answers to inquiries about the mowing this confirmed levin still more in his suspicions he went to the hayfields and examined the stacks the haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagonloads each and to convict the peasants levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly to lift one stack and carry it into the barn there turned out to be only loads in the stack in spite of the village assertions about the compressibility of hay and its having settled down in the stacks and his swearing that everything had been done in fear of god levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders and that therefore he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack after a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking as their share these eleven stacks reckoning them as fifty loads each and apportioning the share anew the arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon when the last of the hay had been divided levin entrusting the superintendence of the rest to the countinghouse clerk sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants 
 in front of him in the bend of the river beyond the little marsh moved a line of peasant women merrily chattering with their ringing voices and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green aftermath after the women came the men with pitchforks and from the gray rows there were growing up broad high soft haycocks to the left telegas were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared and one after another the haycocks vanished flung up in huge forkfuls and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hindquarters 
 what weather for haying what hay be said an old man squatting down beside levin tea not hay like scattering grain to the ducks the way they pick it up he added pointing to the growing haycocks since dinnertime carried a good half of it 
 the last load eh he shouted to a young peasant who drove by standing in the front of an empty telega box shaking the reins of hemp 
 the last dad the lad shouted back pulling in the horse and smiling he looked round at a bright peasant girl who sat in the telega box smiling too and drove on 
 that your son asked levin 
 my dear youngest said the old man with a tender smile 
 what a fine fellow 
 the all right 
 married already 
 yes two years last st day 
 any children 
 children indeed why for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself and bashful too answered the old man what hay this is tea indeed he repeated wishing to change the subject 
 levin looked more attentively at vanka parmenov and his wife they were loading a haycock onto the wagon not far from him ivan parmenov was standing on the wagon taking laying in place and stamping down the huge bundles of hay which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him at first in armfuls and then on the pitchfork the young wife worked easily merrily and deftly the hay did not once break away by her fork first she tedded it stuck the fork into it then with a rapid supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up and arching her full bosom under the long white apron with a deft turn swung the fork in her arms and flung the bundle of hay high onto the wagon ivan obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor made haste opening wide his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the wagon as she raked together what was left of the hay the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck and arranging the red kerchief that was gone backward baring her white brow not browned by the sun she crept under the wagon to tie up the load ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece and at something she said he laughed aloud in the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous young freshly awakened love

 in front of him in the bend of the river beyond the little marsh moved a line of peasant women merrily chattering with their ringing voices and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green aftermath after the women came the men with pitchforks and from the gray rows there were growing up broad high soft haycocks to the left telegas were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared and one after another the haycocks vanished flung up in huge forkfuls and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hindquarters 
 what weather for haying what hay be said an old man squatting down beside levin tea not hay like scattering grain to the ducks the way they pick it up he added pointing to the growing haycocks since dinnertime carried a good half of it

 the load was tied on ivan jumped down and took the quiet sleek horse by the bridle the young wife flung the rake up on the load with a bold step swinging her arms she went to join the women who were forming a ring for the haymakers dance ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded wagons the peasant women with their rakes on their shoulders gay with bright flowers and chattering with ringing merry voices walked behind the hay wagon one wild untrained female voice broke into a song and sang it alone through a verse and then the same verse was unanimously taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices of all sorts coarse and fine 
 the women all singing began to come close to levin and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment the storm swooped down enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying and the other haycocks and wagonloads and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life but he could do nothing and had to lie and look on and listen when the peasants with their singing had vanished out of sight and hearing a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation his physical inactivity his alienation from this world came over levin 
 some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay some whom he had treated with contumely and who had tried to cheat him those very peasants had greeted him and evidently had not were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him any regret any recollection even of having tried to deceive him all that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor god gave the day god gave the strength and the day and the strength were consecrated to labor and that labor was its own reward for whom the labor what would be its fruits these were idle considerations beside the point 
 often levin had admired this life often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life but today for the first time especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of ivan parmenov to his young wife the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary artificial idle and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious pure and generally delightful life 
 the old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home the people had all gone their different ways those who lived near had gone home while those who came from afar were gathered into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasants still lay on the haycock and still looked on and listened and mused the peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night at first there was the sound of merry talk and general laughing over the supper then singing again and laughter 
 all the long day of toil had left no trace in them save lightness of heart before the early dawn all was hushed nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before morning rousing himself levin got up from the haycock and looking at the stars he saw that the night was over 
 well what am i going to do how am i to set about it he said to himself trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in this brief night all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought one was the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation gave him satisfaction and was easy and simple another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he felt clearly and he was convinced he would find in it its content its peace and its dignity of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious but a third series of ideas turned upon the question of how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing took clear shape for him a wife work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how am i to set about it he asked himself again and could not find an answer i slept all night though and i think it out clearly he said to himself work it out later one certain this night has decided my fate all my old dreams of home life were absurd not the real thing he told himself all ever so much simpler and better 
 how beautiful he thought looking at the strange as it were shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky how exquisite it all is in this exquisite night and when was there time for that cloud shell to form just now i looked at the sky and there was nothing in it only two white streaks yes and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed 
 he went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad toward the village a slight wind arose and the sky looked gray and sullen the gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn the full triumph of light over darkness 
 shrinking from the cold levin walked rapidly looking at the ground that someone coming he thought catching the tinkle of bells and lifting his head forty paces from him a carriage and four with the luggage on its top was driving toward him along the grassy highroad on which he was walking the shaft horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road 
 this was all levin noticed and without wondering who it could be he gazed absently at the coach 
 in the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner and at the window evidently only just awake sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap with a face full of light and thought full of a subtle complex inner life that was remote from levin she was gazing from the window at the glow of the sunrise 
 at the very instant when this apparition was vanishing the truthful eyes glanced at him she recognized him and her face lighted up with wondering delight 
 he could not be mistaken there were no other eyes like those in all the world there was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life it was she it was kitty he comprehended that she was driving to ergushovo from the railway station and everything that had been stirring levin during this sleepless night all the resolutions he had made all vanished at once he recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl there only in this carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road and was rapidly disappearing there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late 
 she did not look out again the sound of the carriage springs was no longer audible the bells could scarcely be heard the barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village and all that was left was the empty fields all round the village in front and he himself isolated and apart from it all wandering lonely along the deserted highroad 
 he glanced at the sky expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night there was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell there in the remote heights above a mysterious change had been accomplished there was no trace of a shell and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets the sky had grown blue and bright and with the same softness but with the same remoteness it met his questioning gaze 
 no he said to himself however good that life of simplicity and toil may be i cannot go back to it i love her

 the old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home the people had all gone their different ways those who lived near had gone home while those who came from afar were gathered into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasants still lay on the haycock and still looked on and listened and mused the peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night at first there was the sound of merry talk and general laughing over the supper then singing again and laughter 
 all the long day of toil had left no trace in them save lightness of heart before the early dawn all was hushed nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before morning rousing himself levin got up from the haycock and looking at the stars he saw that the night was over 
 well what am i going to do how am i to set about it he said to himself trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in this brief night all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought one was the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation gave him satisfaction and was easy and simple another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he felt clearly and he was convinced he would find in it its content its peace and its dignity of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious but a third series of ideas turned upon the question of how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing took clear shape for him a wife work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how am i to set about it he asked himself again and could not find an answer i slept all night though and i think it out clearly he said to himself work it out later one certain this night has decided my fate all my old dreams of home life were absurd not the real thing he told himself all ever so much simpler and better 
 how beautiful he thought looking at the strange as it were shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky how exquisite it all is in this exquisite night and when was there time for that cloud shell to form just now i looked at the sky and there was nothing in it only two white streaks yes and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed 
 he went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad toward the village a slight wind arose and the sky looked gray and sullen the gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn the full triumph of light over darkness 
 shrinking from the cold levin walked rapidly looking at the ground that someone coming he thought catching the tinkle of bells and lifting his head forty paces from him a carriage and four with the luggage on its top was driving toward him along the grassy highroad on which he was walking the shaft horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road 
 this was all levin noticed and without wondering who it could be he gazed absently at the coach 
 in the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner and at the window evidently only just awake sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap with a face full of light and thought full of a subtle complex inner life that was remote from levin she was gazing from the window at the glow of the sunrise 
 at the very instant when this apparition was vanishing the truthful eyes glanced at him she recognized him and her face lighted up with wondering delight 
 he could not be mistaken there were no other eyes like those in all the world there was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life it was she it was kitty he comprehended that she was driving to ergushovo from the railway station and everything that had been stirring levin during this sleepless night all the resolutions he had made all vanished at once he recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl there only in this carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road and was rapidly disappearing there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late 
 she did not look out again the sound of the carriage springs was no longer audible the bells could scarcely be heard the barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village and all that was left was the empty fields all round the village in front and he himself isolated and apart from it all wandering lonely along the deserted highroad 
 he glanced at the sky expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night there was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell there in the remote heights above a mysterious change had been accomplished there was no trace of a shell and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets the sky had grown blue and bright and with the same softness but with the same remoteness it met his questioning gaze 
 no he said to himself however good that life of simplicity and toil may be i cannot go back to it i love her

 none but those who were most intimate with alexei alexandrovich knew that while on the surface the coldest and most rational of men he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character alexei alexandrovich could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved the sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lost all power of reflection the head clerk of his board and the secretary were aware of this and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears if they did not want to ruin their chances he will get angry and will not listen to you they used to say and as a fact in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in alexei alexandrovich by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger i can do nothing kindly leave the room he would usually shout in such cases 
 when returning from the races anna had informed him of her relations with vronsky and immediately afterward had burst into tears hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich for all the fury aroused in him against her was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the situation he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stirred nor looked at her this was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed anna 
 when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage and making an effort to master himself took leave of her with his usual urbanity and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision 
 his words confirming his worst suspicions had sent a cruel pang to the heart of alexei alexandrovich that pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her engendered by her tears but when he was all alone in the carriage alexei alexandrovich to his surprise and delight felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy 
 he experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge bigger than the head itself being torn out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feels all at once that what has so long envenomed his existence and enchained his attention exists no longer and that he can live and think again and take an interest in other things besides his tooth this feeling alexei alexandrovich was experiencing the agony had been strange and terrible but now it was over he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife 
 no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman i always knew it and always saw it though i tried to deceive myself to spare her he said to himself and it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it he recalled incidents of their past life in which he had never seen anything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman i made a mistake in linking my life to hers but there was nothing wrong in my mistake and so i cannot be unhappy not i who am to blame he told himself but she but i have nothing to do with her she does not exist for me 
 all that would befall her and her son toward whom his sentiments were as much changed as toward her ceased to interest him the only thing that interested him now was the question in what way he could best with most propriety and comfort for himself and so with most justice shake clear the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall and then proceed along his path of active honorable and useful existence 
 i cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime i have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me and i shall find it he said to himself frowning more and more neither the first nor the last and to say nothing of historical instances dating from menelaus recently revived in the memory of all by la belle hlne a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before alexei imagination daryalov poltavsky prince karibanov count paskudin dram yes even dram such an honest capable fellow semionov chagin sigonin alexei alexandrovich remembered admitting that a certain quite irrational ridicule falls to the lot of these men yet i never saw anything but a misfortune in it and always felt sympathy for it alexei alexandrovich said to himself though indeed this was not the fact and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind but the more often he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands the more highly he had thought of himself it is a misfortune which may befall anyone and this misfortune has befallen me the only thing to be done is to make the best of the situation and he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in 
 daryalov fought a duel 
 the duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of alexei alexandrovich in his youth just because he was physically a fainthearted man and was himself well aware of the fact alexei alexandrovich could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself and never made use of any weapon in his life this horror had in his youth set him often pondering on dueling and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger having attained success and an established position in the world he had long ago forgotten this feeling but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that alexei alexandrovich spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects and hugging the idea of a duel though he was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight one 
 no doubt our society is still so barbarous not the same in england that very many and among these were those whose opinion alexei alexandrovich particularly valued look favorably on the duel but what result is attained by it suppose i call him out alexei alexandrovich went on to himself and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge and the pistol aimed at him he shuddered and knew that he never would do it suppose i call him out suppose i am taught he went on musing i am placed i press the trigger he said to himself closing his eyes and it turns out i have killed him alexei alexandrovich said to himself and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas what sense is there in murdering a man in order to define relation to a guilty wife and son i should still have to decide what i ought to do with her but what is more probable and what would doubtlessly occur i should be killed or wounded i the innocent person should be the victim killed or wounded even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side i know beforehand that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman needed by russia to be exposed to danger what would come of it it would come of it that knowing beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceiving myself and others a duel is quite impossible and no one expects it of me my aim is simply to safeguard my reputation which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties official duties which had always been of great consequence in alexei eyes seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment 
 considering and rejecting the duel alexei alexandrovich turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar alexei alexandrovich could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view in all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife and the very party who being in fault had not the right to contract a marriage had formed counterfeit ties with a new husband in his own case alexei alexandrovich saw that a legal divorce that is to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated was impossible of attainment he saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his guilt required by the law out of the question he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward even if he had them and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her 
 an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attained by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he supposed contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife at the bottom of his heart alexei alexandrovich still had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with vronsky so that her crime would be to her advantage the mere notion of this so exasperated alexei alexandrovich that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony and got up and changed his place in the carriage and for a long while after he sat with scowling brows wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug 
 apart from formal divorce one might still do as karibanov paskudin and that good fellow dram did that is separate from wife he went on thinking when he had regained his composure but this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce and what was more a separation quite as much as a regular divorce flung his wife into the arms of vronsky no out of the question out of the question he said aloud twisting his rug about him again i cannot be unhappy but neither she nor he ought to be happy 
 the feeling of jealousy which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty had passed away at the instant when with agony the tooth had been extracted by his words but that feeling had been replaced by another the desire not merely that she should not triumph but that she should get due punishment for her crime he did not acknowledge this feeling but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind and having dishonored him and once again going over the conditions inseparable from a duel a divorce a separation and once again rejecting them alexei alexandrovich felt convinced that there was only one solution to keep her with him concealing what had happened from the world and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue and still more though this he did not admit to himself to punish her i must communicate to her my decision that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external status quo and that such i agree to retain on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes that is to say cessation of all intercourse with her lover when this decision had been finally adopted another weighty consideration occurred to alexei alexandrovich in support of it by such a course only shall i be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion he told himself in adopting this course i am not casting off a guilty wife but giving her a chance of amendment and indeed difficult as the task will be to me i shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation though alexei alexandrovich was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion yet now when his conclusion corresponded as it seemed to him with the requirements of religion this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction and to some extent restored his peace of mind he was pleased to think that even in such an important crisis in life no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference as he pondered over subsequent developments alexei alexandrovich did not see indeed why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before no doubt she could never regain his esteem but there was not and there could not be any sort of reason why his existence should be troubled and why he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife yes time will pass time which arranges all things and the old relations will be reestablished alexei alexandrovich told himself so far reestablished that is that i shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life she is bound to be unhappy but i am not to blame and so i cannot be unhappy

 no doubt our society is still so barbarous not the same in england that very many and among these were those whose opinion alexei alexandrovich particularly valued look favorably on the duel but what result is attained by it suppose i call him out alexei alexandrovich went on to himself and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge and the pistol aimed at him he shuddered and knew that he never would do it suppose i call him out suppose i am taught he went on musing i am placed i press the trigger he said to himself closing his eyes and it turns out i have killed him alexei alexandrovich said to himself and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas what sense is there in murdering a man in order to define relation to a guilty wife and son i should still have to decide what i ought to do with her but what is more probable and what would doubtlessly occur i should be killed or wounded i the innocent person should be the victim killed or wounded even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side i know beforehand that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman needed by russia to be exposed to danger what would come of it it would come of it that knowing beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceiving myself and others a duel is quite impossible and no one expects it of me my aim is simply to safeguard my reputation which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties official duties which had always been of great consequence in alexei eyes seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment 
 considering and rejecting the duel alexei alexandrovich turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar alexei alexandrovich could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view in all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife and the very party who being in fault had not the right to contract a marriage had formed counterfeit ties with a new husband in his own case alexei alexandrovich saw that a legal divorce that is to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated was impossible of attainment he saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his guilt required by the law out of the question he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward even if he had them and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her 
 an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attained by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he supposed contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife at the bottom of his heart alexei alexandrovich still had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with vronsky so that her crime would be to her advantage the mere notion of this so exasperated alexei alexandrovich that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony and got up and changed his place in the carriage and for a long while after he sat with scowling brows wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug 
 apart from formal divorce one might still do as karibanov paskudin and that good fellow dram did that is separate from wife he went on thinking when he had regained his composure but this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce and what was more a separation quite as much as a regular divorce flung his wife into the arms of vronsky no out of the question out of the question he said aloud twisting his rug about him again i cannot be unhappy but neither she nor he ought to be happy 
 the feeling of jealousy which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty had passed away at the instant when with agony the tooth had been extracted by his words but that feeling had been replaced by another the desire not merely that she should not triumph but that she should get due punishment for her crime he did not acknowledge this feeling but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind and having dishonored him and once again going over the conditions inseparable from a duel a divorce a separation and once again rejecting them alexei alexandrovich felt convinced that there was only one solution to keep her with him concealing what had happened from the world and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue and still more though this he did not admit to himself to punish her i must communicate to her my decision that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external status quo and that such i agree to retain on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes that is to say cessation of all intercourse with her lover when this decision had been finally adopted another weighty consideration occurred to alexei alexandrovich in support of it by such a course only shall i be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion he told himself in adopting this course i am not casting off a guilty wife but giving her a chance of amendment and indeed difficult as the task will be to me i shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation though alexei alexandrovich was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion yet now when his conclusion corresponded as it seemed to him with the requirements of religion this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction and to some extent restored his peace of mind he was pleased to think that even in such an important crisis in life no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference as he pondered over subsequent developments alexei alexandrovich did not see indeed why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before no doubt she could never regain his esteem but there was not and there could not be any sort of reason why his existence should be troubled and why he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife yes time will pass time which arranges all things and the old relations will be reestablished alexei alexandrovich told himself so far reestablished that is that i shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life she is bound to be unhappy but i am not to blame and so i cannot be unhappy

 none but those who were most intimate with alexei alexandrovich knew that while on the surface the coldest and most rational of men he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character alexei alexandrovich could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved the sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lost all power of reflection the head clerk of his board and the secretary were aware of this and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears if they did not want to ruin their chances he will get angry and will not listen to you they used to say and as a fact in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in alexei alexandrovich by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger i can do nothing kindly leave the room he would usually shout in such cases 
 when returning from the races anna had informed him of her relations with vronsky and immediately afterward had burst into tears hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich for all the fury aroused in him against her was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the situation he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stirred nor looked at her this was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed anna 
 when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage and making an effort to master himself took leave of her with his usual urbanity and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision 
 his words confirming his worst suspicions had sent a cruel pang to the heart of alexei alexandrovich that pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her engendered by her tears but when he was all alone in the carriage alexei alexandrovich to his surprise and delight felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy 
 he experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge bigger than the head itself being torn out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feels all at once that what has so long envenomed his existence and enchained his attention exists no longer and that he can live and think again and take an interest in other things besides his tooth this feeling alexei alexandrovich was experiencing the agony had been strange and terrible but now it was over he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife 
 no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman i always knew it and always saw it though i tried to deceive myself to spare her he said to himself and it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it he recalled incidents of their past life in which he had never seen anything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman i made a mistake in linking my life to hers but there was nothing wrong in my mistake and so i cannot be unhappy not i who am to blame he told himself but she but i have nothing to do with her she does not exist for me 
 all that would befall her and her son toward whom his sentiments were as much changed as toward her ceased to interest him the only thing that interested him now was the question in what way he could best with most propriety and comfort for himself and so with most justice shake clear the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall and then proceed along his path of active honorable and useful existence 
 i cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime i have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me and i shall find it he said to himself frowning more and more neither the first nor the last and to say nothing of historical instances dating from menelaus recently revived in the memory of all by la belle hlne a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before alexei imagination daryalov poltavsky prince karibanov count paskudin dram yes even dram such an honest capable fellow semionov chagin sigonin alexei alexandrovich remembered admitting that a certain quite irrational ridicule falls to the lot of these men yet i never saw anything but a misfortune in it and always felt sympathy for it alexei alexandrovich said to himself though indeed this was not the fact and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind but the more often he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands the more highly he had thought of himself it is a misfortune which may befall anyone and this misfortune has befallen me the only thing to be done is to make the best of the situation and he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in

 in his study alexei alexandrovich walked up and down twice and stopped at an immense writing table on which six candles had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him he cracked his knuckles and sat down sorting out his writing appurtenances putting his elbows on the table he bent his head on one side thought a minute and began to write without pausing for a second he wrote without using any form of address to her and wrote in french making use of the plural vous which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding russian form

 he read the letter through and felt pleased with it and especially because he had remembered to enclose money there was not a harsh word not a reproach in it nor was there undue indulgence most of all it was a golden bridge for a return folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife and putting it in an envelope with the money he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the appointments of his writing table

 alexei alexandrovich ordered tea to be brought to the study and playing with the massive paper knife he moved to his easy chair near which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the french work on les tables eugubines that he had begun over the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of anna a fine painting by a celebrated artist alexei alexandrovich glanced at it the unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him as they did that night of their last explanation insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in alexei eyes of the black lace about the head admirably touched in by the painter the black hair and handsome white hand the fourth finger of which was covered with rings after looking at the portrait for a minute alexei alexandrovich shuddered so that his lips quivered and produced brrr and turned away he made haste to sit down in his easy chair and opened the book he tried to read but he could not revive the very vivid interest he had felt before in eugubine inscriptions he looked at the book and thought of something else he thought not of his wife but of a complication that had arisen in his official life which at the time constituted the chief interest of it he felt that he had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair and that he had originated a leading idea he could say it without calculated to clear up the whole business to strengthen him in his official career to discomfit his enemies and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the state directly the servant had set the tea and left the room alexei alexandrovich got up and went to the writing table moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of current papers with a scarcely perceptible smile of he took a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication the complication was of this nature alexei characteristic quality as a politician that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses the qualification that with his unflagging ambition his reserve his honesty and his had made his career was his contempt for red tape his cutting down of correspondence his direct contact wherever possible with the living fact and his economy it happened that the famous commission of the nd of june had set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the zaraisky province which fell under alexei department and was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms alexei alexandrovich was aware of the truth of this the irrigation of these lands in the zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of alexei predecessor and vast sums of money had actually been spent and were still being spent on this business and utterly unproductively and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever alexei alexandrovich had perceived this at once on entering office and would have liked to lay hands on the business but at first when he did not yet feel secure in his position he knew it would affect too many interests and would be imprudent later on he had been engrossed in other questions and had simply forgotten this case it went of itself like all such cases by the mere force of inertia many people gained their livelihood by this business especially one highly conscientious and musical family all the daughters played on stringed instruments and alexei alexandrovich knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters the raising of this question by a hostile ministry was in alexei opinion a dishonorable proceeding seeing that in every ministry there were things similar and worse which no one inquired into for reasons of official etiquette however now that the gauntlet had been thrown down to him he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the commission of irrigation of the lands in the zaraisky province but in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either he demanded also the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the native tribes organization the question of the native tribes had been brought up incidentally in the committee of the nd of june and had been pressed forward actively by alexei alexandrovich as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes in the committee this question had been a ground of contention between several ministries the ministry hostile to alexei alexandrovich proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity and that if there were anything wrong it arose mainly from the failure on the part of alexei ministry to carry out the measures prescribed by law now alexei alexandrovich intended to demand first that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot secondly if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official data in the hands of the committee that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the a political b administrative c economic d ethnographical e material and f religious points of view thirdly that evidence should be required from the rival ministry of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that ministry for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed and fourthly and finally that that ministry be asked to explain why it had as appeared from the reports submitted before the committee under nos and dated december and june respectively acted in direct contravention of the intention of the basic and organic law t statute and the note to statute a flush of eagerness suffused the face of alexei alexandrovich as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit having filled a sheet of paper he got up rang and sent a note to the head clerk to look up certain necessary facts for him getting up and walking about the room he glanced again at the portrait frowned and smiled contemptuously after reading a little more of the book on eugubine inscriptions and renewing his interest in it alexei alexandrovich went to bed at eleven and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his wife he saw it now in by no

shuddered so that his lips quivered and produced brrr and turned away he made haste to sit down in his easy chair and opened the book he tried to read but he could not revive the very vivid interest

the gauntlet had been thrown down to him he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the commission of irrigation of the

 though anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted vronsky when he told her their position was impossible and persuaded her to lay open everything to her husband at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable and she longed with her whole soul to change it on the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so she was glad of it after her husband had left her she told herself that she was glad that now everything was made clear and at least there would be no more lying and deception it seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever it might be bad this new position but it would be clear there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it the pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear she thought that evening she saw vronsky but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband though to make the position clear it was necessary to tell him 
 when she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange coarse words and could not imagine what would come of it but the words were spoken and alexei alexandrovich had gone away without saying anything i saw vronsky and did not tell him at the very instant he was going away i would have turned him back and told him but i changed my mind because it was strange that i had not told him the first minute why was it i wanted to tell him and and in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face she knew what had kept her from it she knew that she had been ashamed her position which had seemed to her simplified the night before suddenly struck her now as not only not simple but as absolutely hopeless she felt terrified at the disgrace of which she had not even thought before directly she thought of what her husband would do the most terrible ideas came to her mind she had a vision of being turned out of the house of her shame being proclaimed to all the world she asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house and she could not find an answer 
 when she thought of vronsky it seemed to her that he did not love her that he was already beginning to be tired of her that she could not offer herself to him and she felt bitter against him for it it seemed to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband and had continually repeated in her imagination she had said to everyone and everyone had heard them she could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face she could not bring herself to call her maid and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess 
 the maid who had been listening at her door for a long while came into her room of her own accord anna glanced inquiringly into her face and blushed with a scared look the maid begged her pardon for coming in saying that she had fancied the bell rang she brought her clothes and a note the note was from betsy betsy reminded her that liza merkalova and baroness stoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers kaluzhsky and old stremov come if only as a study in characters i shall expect you she finished 
 anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh 
 nothing i need nothing she said to annushka who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table you may go dress at once and come down i need nothing nothing 
 annushka went out but anna did not begin dressing and sat in the same position her head and hands hanging listlessly and every now and then she shivered all over was apparently about to make some gesture utter some word and sank back into lifelessness again she repeated continually my god my god but neither god nor my had any meaning to her the idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from alexei alexandrovich himself although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up she knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life she was not simply miserable she began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition never experienced before in which she found herself she felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her soul just as objects sometimes appear double to overtired eyes she hardly knew at times what it was she feared and what she hoped for whether she feared or desired what had happened or what was going to happen and exactly what she longed for she could not have said 
 ah what am i doing she said to herself feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her head when she came to herself she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands each side of her temples and she was pressing them she jumped up and began walking about 
 the coffee is ready and mademoiselle and seriozha are waiting said annushka coming back again and finding anna in the same position 
 seriozha what about seriozha anna asked with sudden eagerness recollecting her existence for the first time that morning 
 been naughty i think answered annushka with a smile 
 in what way 
 some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room i think he ate one of them on the sly 
 the recollection of her son suddenly roused anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself she recalled the partly sincere though greatly exaggerated role of the mother living for her child which she had taken up of late years and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a dominion independent of any position she would be placed in by her relations to her husband or to vronsky this dominion was her son in whatever position she might be placed she could not abandon her son her husband might put her to shame and turn her out vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life apart she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach she could not leave her son she had an aim in life and she must act act to secure the position of her son so that he might not be taken from her quickly indeed as quickly as possible she must take action before he was taken from her she must take her son and go away here was the one thing she had to do now she must be calm and get out of this insufferable position the thought of immediate action binding her to her son of going away somewhere with him gave her this calming 
 she dressed quickly went downstairs and with resolute steps walked into the drawing room where she found as usual waiting for her the coffee seriozha and his governess seriozha all in white with his back and head bent was standing at a table under a looking glass and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well and in which he resembled his father he was doing something to the flowers he carried 
 the governess had a particularly severe expression seriozha screamed shrilly as he often did ah mamma and stopped hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers 
 the governess after saying good morning began a long and detailed account of naughtiness but anna did not hear her she was considering whether she would take her with her or not no i take her she decided go alone with my son 
 yes very wrong said anna and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him not severely but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy and she kissed him leave him to me she said to the astonished governess and without letting go of her son she sat down at the table where coffee was set ready for her 
 mamma i i he said trying to make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches 
 seriozha she said as soon as the governess had left the room that was wrong but never do it again will you you love me 
 she felt that the tears were coming into her eyes can i help loving him she said to herself looking deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eyes and can he ever join his father in punishing me is it possible he will not feel for me tears were already flowing down her face and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out on the terrace 
 after the thundershowers of the last few days cold bright weather had set in the air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves 
 she shivered both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air 
 run along run along to mariette she said to seriozha who had followed her out and she began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace can it be that they forgive me understand how it all could not have been otherwise she said to herself 
 standing still and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind with their freshly washed brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine she knew that they would not forgive her that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky that green and again she felt that everything was doubling in her soul i think she said to herself i must get ready to go where when whom to take with me yes to moscow by the evening train annushka and seriozha and only the most necessary things but first i must write to them both she went quickly indoors into her boudoir sat down at the table and wrote to her husband 
 after what has happened i cannot remain any longer in your house i am going away and taking my son with me i know the law and so i know with which of the parents the son should remain but i take him with me because i cannot live without him be generous leave him to me 
 up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally but the appeal to his generosity a quality she did not recognize in him and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching pulled her up 
 of my fault and my remorse i cannot speak because 
 she stopped again finding no connection in her ideas no she said to herself no need of anything and tearing up the letter she wrote it again leaving out the allusion to generosity and sealed it up 
 another letter had to be written to vronsky i have told my husband she wrote and she sat a long while unable to write more it was so coarse so unfeminine and what more am i to write him she said to herself again a flush of shame spread over her face she recalled his composure and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits no need of anything she said to herself and closing her blotting case she went upstairs told the governess and the servants that she was going that day to moscow and at once set to work to pack up her things

 she felt that the tears were coming into her eyes can i help loving him she said to herself looking deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eyes and can he ever join his father in punishing me is it possible he will not feel for me tears were already flowing down her face and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out on the terrace 
 after the thundershowers of the last few days cold bright weather had set in the air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves 
 she shivered both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air 
 run along run along to mariette she said to seriozha who had followed her out and she began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace can it be that they forgive me understand how it all could not have been otherwise she said to herself 
 standing still and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind with their freshly washed brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine she knew that they would not forgive her that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky that green and again she felt that everything was doubling in her soul i think she said to herself i must get ready to go where when whom to take with me yes to moscow by the evening train annushka and seriozha and only the most necessary things but first i must write to them both she went quickly indoors into her boudoir sat down at the table and wrote to her husband 
 after what has happened i cannot remain any longer in your house i am going away and taking my son with me i know the law and so i know with which of the parents the son should remain but i take him with me because i cannot live without him be generous leave him to me 
 up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally but the appeal to his generosity a quality she did not recognize in him and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching pulled her up 
 of my fault and my remorse i cannot speak because 
 she stopped again finding no connection in her ideas no she said to herself no need of anything and tearing up the letter she wrote it again leaving out the allusion to generosity and sealed it up 
 another letter had to be written to vronsky i have told my husband she wrote and she sat a long while unable to write more it was so coarse so unfeminine and what more am i to write him she said to herself again a flush of shame spread over her face she recalled his composure and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits no need of anything she said to herself and closing her blotting case she went upstairs told the governess and the servants that she was going that day to moscow and at once set to work to pack up her things

 though anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted vronsky when he told her their position was impossible and persuaded her to lay open everything to her husband at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable and she longed with her whole soul to change it on the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so she was glad of it after her husband had left her she told herself that she was glad that now everything was made clear and at least there would be no more lying and deception it seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever it might be bad this new position but it would be clear there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it the pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear she thought that evening she saw vronsky but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband though to make the position clear it was necessary to tell him 
 when she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange coarse words and could not imagine what would come of it but the words were spoken and alexei alexandrovich had gone away without saying anything i saw vronsky and did not tell him at the very instant he was going away i would have turned him back and told him but i changed my mind because it was strange that i had not told him the first minute why was it i wanted to tell him and and in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face she knew what had kept her from it she knew that she had been ashamed her position which had seemed to her simplified the night before suddenly struck her now as not only not simple but as absolutely hopeless she felt terrified at the disgrace of which she had not even thought before directly she thought of what her husband would do the most terrible ideas came to her mind she had a vision of being turned out of the house of her shame being proclaimed to all the world she asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house and she could not find an answer 
 when she thought of vronsky it seemed to her that he did not love her that he was already beginning to be tired of her that she could not offer herself to him and she felt bitter against him for it it seemed to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband and had continually repeated in her imagination she had said to everyone and everyone had heard them she could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face she could not bring herself to call her maid and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess 
 the maid who had been listening at her door for a long while came into her room of her own accord anna glanced inquiringly into her face and blushed with a scared look the maid begged her pardon for coming in saying that she had fancied the bell rang she brought her clothes and a note the note was from betsy betsy reminded her that liza merkalova and baroness stoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers kaluzhsky and old stremov come if only as a study in characters i shall expect you she finished 
 anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh 
 nothing i need nothing she said to annushka who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table you may go dress at once and come down i need nothing nothing 
 annushka went out but anna did not begin dressing and sat in the same position her head and hands hanging listlessly and every now and then she shivered all over was apparently about to make some gesture utter some word and sank back into lifelessness again she repeated continually my god my god but neither god nor my had any meaning to her the idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from alexei alexandrovich himself although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up she knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life she was not simply miserable she began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition never experienced before in which she found herself she felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her soul just as objects sometimes appear double to overtired eyes she hardly knew at times what it was she feared and what she hoped for whether she feared or desired what had happened or what was going to happen and exactly what she longed for she could not have said 
 ah what am i doing she said to herself feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her head when she came to herself she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands each side of her temples and she was pressing them she jumped up and began walking about 
 the coffee is ready and mademoiselle and seriozha are waiting said annushka coming back again and finding anna in the same position 
 seriozha what about seriozha anna asked with sudden eagerness recollecting her existence for the first time that morning 
 been naughty i think answered annushka with a smile 
 in what way 
 some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room i think he ate one of them on the sly 
 the recollection of her son suddenly roused anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself she recalled the partly sincere though greatly exaggerated role of the mother living for her child which she had taken up of late years and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a dominion independent of any position she would be placed in by her relations to her husband or to vronsky this dominion was her son in whatever position she might be placed she could not abandon her son her husband might put her to shame and turn her out vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life apart she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach she could not leave her son she had an aim in life and she must act act to secure the position of her son so that he might not be taken from her quickly indeed as quickly as possible she must take action before he was taken from her she must take her son and go away here was the one thing she had to do now she must be calm and get out of this insufferable position the thought of immediate action binding her to her son of going away somewhere with him gave her this calming 
 she dressed quickly went downstairs and with resolute steps walked into the drawing room where she found as usual waiting for her the coffee seriozha and his governess seriozha all in white with his back and head bent was standing at a table under a looking glass and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well and in which he resembled his father he was doing something to the flowers he carried 
 the governess had a particularly severe expression seriozha screamed shrilly as he often did ah mamma and stopped hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers 
 the governess after saying good morning began a long and detailed account of naughtiness but anna did not hear her she was considering whether she would take her with her or not no i take her she decided go alone with my son 
 yes very wrong said anna and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him not severely but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy and she kissed him leave him to me she said to the astonished governess and without letting go of her son she sat down at the table where coffee was set ready for her 
 mamma i i he said trying to make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches 
 seriozha she said as soon as the governess had left the room that was wrong but never do it again will you you love me

 all the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters gardeners and footmen going to and fro carrying out things cupboards and chests were open twice they had to run to a store for cord pieces of newspaper were cluttering the floor two trunks some bags and plaids had been carried down into the hall the carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps anna forgetting her inward agitation in the work of packing was standing at a table in her boudoir packing her traveling bag when annushka called her attention to the clatter of some carriage driving up anna looked out of the window and saw alexei messenger on the steps ringing at the front doorbell 
 run and find out what it is she said and with a calm sense of being prepared for anything she sat down in a low chair folding her hands on her knees a footman brought in a thick packet directed in alexei hand 
 the messenger has orders to wait for an answer he said 
 very well she said and as soon as he had left the room she tore open the letter with trembling fingers a packet of unfolded banknotes done up with a band fell out of it she extricated the letter and began reading it from the end preparations shall be made for your arrival here i attach particular significance to compliance she read she ran through it backward read it all through and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning when she had finished she felt that she was cold all over and that a fearful calamity such as she had not expected had burst upon her 
 in the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband and wished for nothing so much as that those words might be unspoken and here this letter regarded them as unspoken and gave her what she had wanted but now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she had been able to conceive 
 right she said of course always right a christian generous yes vile base creature and no one understands it except me and no one ever will and i explain it they say so religious so so upright so clever but they see what seen they know how he has crushed my life for eight years crushed everything that was living in me he has not once even thought that a live woman who must have love they know how at every step humiliated me and been just as pleased with himself i striven striven with all my strength to find something to give meaning to my life i struggled to love him to love my son when i could not love my husband but the time came when i knew that i cheat myself any longer that i was alive that i was not to blame that god has made me so that i must love and live and now what does he do if killed me if killed him i could have borne anything i could have forgiven anything but no he 
 how was it i guess what he would do doing just natural to his mean character keep himself in the right while drive me in my ruin still lower still to worse ruin 
 you can conjecture what awaits you and your son she recalled a part of his letter a threat to take away my child and most likely according to their stupid law he can but i know very well why he says it he believe even in my love for my child or he despises it just as he always used to ridicule it he despises that feeling in me but he knows that i abandon my child that i abandon my child that there could be no life for me without my child even with him whom i love but that if i abandoned my child and ran away from him i should be acting like the most infamous basest of women he knows that and knows that i am incapable of doing that 
 our life must go on as it has done in the past she recalled another sentence in his letter that life was miserable enough in the old days it has been awful of late what will it be now and he knows all that he knows that i repent breathing repent loving he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit but he wants to go on torturing me i know him i know that at home and is happy in deceit like a fish swimming in the water no i give him that happiness break through the web of lies in which he wants to catch me come what may better than lying and deceit 
 but how my god my god was ever a woman so miserable as i am 
 no i will break through it i will break through it she cried jumping up and keeping back her tears and she went to the writing table to write him another letter but at the bottom of her heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through anything that she was not strong enough to get out of her old position however false and dishonorable it might be 
 she sat down at the writing table but instead of writing she clasped her hands on the table and laying her head on them burst into tears with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying she was weeping because her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been annihilated forever she knew beforehand that everything would go on in the old way and far worse indeed than in the old way she felt that her position in the world she enjoyed and which had seemed to her of so little consequence in the morning was now precious to her that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join her lover that however much she might struggle she could not be stronger than herself she would never know freedom in love but would remain forever a guilty wife with the menace of detection hanging over her at every instant deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from her whose life she could never share she knew that this was how it would be and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in and she cried without restraint as children cry when they are punished 
 the sound of a steps forced her to rouse herself and hiding her face from him she pretended to be writing 
 the messenger asks if any answer the footman informed her 
 any answer yes said anna let him wait ring 
 what can i write she thought what can i decide upon alone what do i know what do i want what is there i care for again she felt that her soul was beginning to double she was terrified again at this feeling and clutched at the first pretext for doing something which might divert her thoughts from herself i ought to see alexei so she called vronsky in her thoughts no one but he can tell me what i ought to do go to perhaps i shall see him there she said to herself completely forgetting that when she had told him the day before that she was not going to princess he had said that in that case he should not go either she went up to the table wrote to her husband i have received your letter a and ringing the bell gave it to the footman

 all the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters gardeners and footmen going to and fro carrying out things cupboards and chests were open twice they had to run to a store for cord pieces of newspaper were cluttering the floor two trunks some bags and plaids had been carried down into the hall the carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps anna forgetting her inward agitation in the work of packing was standing at a table in her boudoir packing her traveling bag when annushka called her attention to the clatter of some carriage driving up anna looked out of the window and saw alexei messenger on the steps ringing at the front doorbell 
 run and find out what it is she said and with a calm sense of being prepared for anything she sat down in a low chair folding her hands on her knees a footman brought in a thick packet directed in alexei hand 
 the messenger has orders to wait for an answer he said 
 very well she said and as soon as he had left the room she tore open the letter with trembling fingers a packet of unfolded banknotes done up with a band fell out of it she extricated the letter and began reading it from the end preparations shall be made for your arrival here i attach particular significance to compliance she read she ran through it backward read it all through and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning when she had finished she felt that she was cold all over and that a fearful calamity such as she had not expected had burst upon her 
 in the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband and wished for nothing so much as that those words might be unspoken and here this letter regarded them as unspoken and gave her what she had wanted but now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she had been able to conceive 
 right she said of course always right a christian generous yes vile base creature and no one understands it except me and no one ever will and i explain it they say so religious so so upright so clever but they see what seen they know how he has crushed my life for eight years crushed everything that was living in me he has not once even thought that a live woman who must have love they know how at every step humiliated me and been just as pleased with himself i striven striven with all my strength to find something to give meaning to my life i struggled to love him to love my son when i could not love my husband but the time came when i knew that i cheat myself any longer that i was alive that i was not to blame that god has made me so that i must love and live and now what does he do if killed me if killed him i could have borne anything i could have forgiven anything but no he 
 how was it i guess what he would do doing just natural to his mean character keep himself in the right while drive me in my ruin still lower still to worse ruin 
 you can conjecture what awaits you and your son she recalled a part of his letter a threat to take away my child and most likely according to their stupid law he can but i know very well why he says it he believe even in my love for my child or he despises it just as he always used to ridicule it he despises that feeling in me but he knows that i abandon my child that i abandon my child that there could be no life for me without my child even with him whom i love but that if i abandoned my child and ran away from him i should be acting like the most infamous basest of women he knows that and knows that i am incapable of doing that 
 our life must go on as it has done in the past she recalled another sentence in his letter that life was miserable enough in the old days it has been awful of late what will it be now and he knows all that he knows that i repent breathing repent loving he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit but he wants to go on torturing me i know him i know that at home and is happy in deceit like a fish swimming in the water no i give him that happiness break through the web of lies in which he wants to catch me come what may better than lying and deceit 
 but how my god my god was ever a woman so miserable as i am 
 no i will break through it i will break through it she cried jumping up and keeping back her tears and she went to the writing table to write him another letter but at the bottom of her heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through anything that she was not strong enough to get out of her old position however false and dishonorable it might be 
 she sat down at the writing table but instead of writing she clasped her hands on the table and laying her head on them burst into tears with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying she was weeping because her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been annihilated forever she knew beforehand that everything would go on in the old way and far worse indeed than in the old way she felt that her position in the world she enjoyed and which had seemed to her of so little consequence in the morning was now precious to her that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join her lover that however much she might struggle she could not be stronger than herself she would never know freedom in love but would remain forever a guilty wife with the menace of detection hanging over her at every instant deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from her whose life she could never share she knew that this was how it would be and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in and she cried without restraint as children cry when they are punished 
 the sound of a steps forced her to rouse herself and hiding her face from him she pretended to be writing 
 the messenger asks if any answer the footman informed her 
 any answer yes said anna let him wait ring 
 what can i write she thought what can i decide upon alone what do i know what do i want what is there i care for again she felt that her soul was beginning to double she was terrified again at this feeling and clutched at the first pretext for doing something which might divert her thoughts from herself i ought to see alexei so she called vronsky in her thoughts no one but he can tell me what i ought to do go to perhaps i shall see him there she said to herself completely forgetting that when she had told him the day before that she was not going to princess he had said that in that case he should not go either she went up to the table wrote to her husband i have received your letter a and ringing the bell gave it to the footman

 the croquet party to which the princess tverskaia had invited anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers these two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new peterburg circle nicknamed in imitation of some imitation les sept merveilles du monde these ladies belonged to a circle which though of the highest society was utterly hostile to that in which anna moved moreover old stremov one of the most influential people in peterburg and the admirer of liza merkalova was alexei enemy in the political world from all these considerations anna had not meant to go and the hints in princess note referred to her refusal but now anna was eager to go in the hope of seeing vronsky 
 anna arrived at princess earlier than the other guests 
 at the very moment of her entry footman with his side whiskers combed out and looking like a kammerjunker went in too he stopped at the door and taking off his cap let her pass anna recognized him and only then recalled that vronsky had told her the day before that he would not come most likely he was sending a note to say so 
 as she took off her outer garment in the hall she heard the footman say rolling his even like a kammerjunker from the count for the princess as he handed over the note 
 she longed to question him as to where his master was she longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her or to go herself to see him but none of the three courses was possible already she heard bells ringing ahead of her to announce her arrival and princess footman was standing at the open door waiting for her to pass into the inner rooms 
 the princess is in the garden she will be informed immediately would you be pleased to walk into the garden announced another footman in another room 
 the position of uncertainty of indecision was still the same as at home worse in fact since it was impossible to take any step impossible to see vronsky and she had to remain here among outsiders in company so uncongenial to her present mood but she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her she was not alone all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to and she felt less wretched than at home she was not forced to think what she had to do everything would be done of itself on meeting betsy coming toward her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance anna smiled to her just as she always did princess tverskaia was walking with tushkevich and a young lady a relation who to the great joy of her parents in the provinces was spending the summer with the fashionable princess 
 there was probably something unusual about anna for betsy noticed it at once 
 i slept badly answered anna looking intently at the footman who came to meet them and as she supposed brought note 
 how glad i am come said betsy tired and was just longing to have some tea before they come you might go she turned to tushkevich with masha and try the croquet ground over there where been clipping it we shall have time to talk a little over tea have a cozy chat eh she said in english to anna with a smile pressing the hand which held a parasol 
 yes especially as i stay very long with you forced to go on to old madame vrede been promising to go for a century said anna to whom lying alien as it was to her nature had become not merely simple and natural in society but a positive source of satisfaction why she said this which she had not thought of a second before she could not have explained she had said it simply from the reflection that as vronsky would not be here she had better secure her own freedom and try to see him somehow but why she had spoken of old hoffraulein vrede whom she had to go and see as she had to see many other people she could not have explained and yet as it afterward turned out had she cudgeled her brains for the most cunning subterfuge to meet vronsky she could have thought of nothing better 
 no not going to let you go for anything answered betsy looking intently into face really if i were not fond of you i should feel offended one would think you were afraid my society would compromise you tea in the small dining room please she said half closing her eyes as she always did when addressing the footman 
 taking the note from him she read it 
 alexei is playing us false she said in french he writes that he come she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that vronsky could mean anything more to anna than a game of croquet anna knew that betsy knew everything but hearing how she spoke of vronsky before her she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing 
 ah said anna indifferently as though not greatly interested in the matter and she went on smiling how can you or your friends compromise anyone 
 this playing with words this hiding of a secret had a great fascination for anna as indeed it has for all women and it was not the necessity of concealment not the purpose for which the concealment was contrived but the process of concealment itself which attracted her 
 i be more catholic than the pope she said stremov and liza merkalova why the cream of the cream of society besides received everywhere and i she laid special stress on the i have never been strict and intolerant simply that i the time 
 no you care perhaps to meet stremov let him and alexei alexandrovich tilt at each other in the committee no affair of ours but in society the most amiable man i know and an ardent croquet player you shall see and in spite of his absurd position as lovesick swain at his age you ought to see how he carries off the absurd position very nice you know sappho stoltz oh a new type quite new 
 betsy went on with all this chatter yet at the same time from her shrewd glance anna felt that she partly guessed her plight and was hatching something for her benefit they were in the little boudoir 
 i must write to alexei though and betsy sat down to the table scribbled a few lines and put the note in an envelope telling him to come to dinner one lady extra to dinner with me and no man to take her in look what said will that persuade him excuse me i must leave you for a minute would you seal it up please and send it off she said from the door i have to give some directions 
 without a hesitation anna sat down to the table with letter and without reading it wrote below essential for me to see you come to the vrede garden i shall be there at six she sealed it up and betsy coming back in her presence handed the note for transmittal 
 at tea which was brought them on a little tea table in the cool little drawing room a cozy chat promised by princess tverskaia before the arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women they criticized the people they were expecting and the conversation fell upon liza merkalova 
 very sweet and i always liked her said anna 
 you ought to like her she raves about you yesterday she came up to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you she says a real heroine of romance and that if she were a man she would do all sorts of mad things for your sake stremov says she does that as it is 
 but do tell me please i never could make it out said anna after being silent for some time speaking in a tone that showed she was not asking an idle question but that what she was asking was of greater importance to her than it should have been do tell me please what are her relations with prince kaluzhsky mishka as called met them so little what does it mean 
 betsy smiled with her eyes and looked intently at anna 
 a new mode she said all adopted that mode flung their caps over the windmills but there are ways and ways of flinging them 
 yes but precisely what are her relations with kaluzhsky 
 betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter a thing which rarely happened with her 
 encroaching on princess special domain now the question of an enfant terrible and betsy obviously tried to restrain herself but could not and went off into peals of that infectious laughter peculiar to people who do not laugh often better ask them she brought out between tears of laughter 
 no you laugh said anna laughing too in spite of herself but i never could understand it i understand the role in it 
 the husband liza husband carries her shawl and is always ready to be of use but no one cares to inquire about what is really going on you know in decent society one talk or think even of certain details of the toilet how it is in this case 
 will you be at madame fete asked anna to change the conversation 
 i think so answered betsy and without looking at her friend she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea putting a cup before anna she took out a thin cigarette and fitting it into a silver holder she lighted it like this you see in a fortunate position she began quite serious now as she took up her cup i understand you and i understand liza liza now is one of those naive natures that like children know good and bad anyway she comprehend it when she was very young and now aware that the lack of comprehension suits her now perhaps she know on purpose said betsy with a subtle smile but anyway it suits her the very same thing you see may be looked at tragically and turned into misery or it may be looked at simply and even humorously possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically 
 how i should like to know other people just as i know myself said anna seriously and dreamily am i worse than other people or better i think worse

 betsy smiled with her eyes and looked intently at anna

 the croquet party to which the princess tverskaia had invited anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers these two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new peterburg circle nicknamed in imitation of some imitation les sept merveilles du monde these ladies belonged to a circle which though of the highest society was utterly hostile to that in which anna moved moreover old stremov one of the most influential people in peterburg and the admirer of liza merkalova was alexei enemy in the political world from all these considerations anna had not meant to go and the hints in princess note referred to her refusal but now anna was eager to go in the hope of seeing vronsky 
 anna arrived at princess earlier than the other guests 
 at the very moment of her entry footman with his side whiskers combed out and looking like a kammerjunker went in too he stopped at the door and taking off his cap let her pass anna recognized him and only then recalled that vronsky had told her the day before that he would not come most likely he was sending a note to say so 
 as she took off her outer garment in the hall she heard the footman say rolling his even like a kammerjunker from the count for the princess as he handed over the note 
 she longed to question him as to where his master was she longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her or to go herself to see him but none of the three courses was possible already she heard bells ringing ahead of her to announce her arrival and princess footman was standing at the open door waiting for her to pass into the inner rooms 
 the princess is in the garden she will be informed immediately would you be pleased to walk into the garden announced another footman in another room 
 the position of uncertainty of indecision was still the same as at home worse in fact since it was impossible to take any step impossible to see vronsky and she had to remain here among outsiders in company so uncongenial to her present mood but she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her she was not alone all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to and she felt less wretched than at home she was not forced to think what she had to do everything would be done of itself on meeting betsy coming toward her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance anna smiled to her just as she always did princess tverskaia was walking with tushkevich and a young lady a relation who to the great joy of her parents in the provinces was spending the summer with the fashionable princess 
 there was probably something unusual about anna for betsy noticed it at once 
 i slept badly answered anna looking intently at the footman who came to meet them and as she supposed brought note 
 how glad i am come said betsy tired and was just longing to have some tea before they come you might go she turned to tushkevich with masha and try the croquet ground over there where been clipping it we shall have time to talk a little over tea have a cozy chat eh she said in english to anna with a smile pressing the hand which held a parasol

 they heard the sound of steps and a voice then a voice and laughter and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests sappho stoltz and a young man beaming with excess of health the vaska it was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak truffles and burgundy were profitable for his health vaska bowed to the two ladies and glanced at them but only for one second he walked after sappho into the drawing room and followed her about as though he were chained to her keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her sappho stoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes she walked with smart little steps in shoes and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man 
 anna had never met this new star of fashion and was struck by her beauty the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried and the boldness of her manners on her head there was such an echafaudage of soft golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust of which so much was exposed in front the impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress and the question involuntarily rose in mind where in the undulating mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman so small and slender so naked in front and so hidden behind and below really came to an end 
 betsy made haste to introduce her to anna 
 only fancy we all but ran over two soldiers she began telling them at once using her eyes smiling and twitching away her train which she at first threw too much to one side i drove here with vaska ah to be sure you know each other and mentioning his surname she introduced the young man and reddening broke into a ringing laugh at her mistake that is at her having called him vaska before a stranger vaska bowed once more to anna but he said nothing to her he addressed sappho lost your bet we got here first pay up said he smiling 
 sappho laughed still more festively 
 not just now said she 
 all one have it later 
 very well very well oh yes she turned suddenly to princess betsy i am a nice person i positively forgot it brought you a visitor and here he comes 
 the unexpected young visitor whom sappho had brought with her and whom she had forgotten was however a personage of such consequence that in spite of his youth both the ladies rose on his entrance 
 he was a new admirer of like vaska he now dogged her footsteps 
 soon after prince kaluzhsky arrived and liza merkalova with stremov liza merkalova was a thin brunette with an oriental languid type of face and charming as everyone used to say ineffable eyes the tone of her dark dress anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty liza was as soft and loose as sappho was tight and shackled 
 but to taste liza was far more attractive betsy had said to anna that she had adopted the pose of an unsophisticated child but when anna saw her she felt this was not the truth she really was unsophisticated spoiled yet a sweet and irresponsible woman it is true that her tone was the same as that like sappho she had two men one young and one old tacked on to her and devouring her with their eyes but there was something in her higher than her surroundings there was in her the glow of the real diamond among paste this glow shone out in her charming truly ineffable eyes the weary and at the same time passionate glance of those eyes encircled by dark rings impressed one by its perfect sincerity everyone looking into those eyes fancied he knew her wholly and knowing her could not but love her at the sight of anna her whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight 
 ah how glad i am to see you she said going up to her yesterday at the races i wanted just to get to you but gone away i did so want to see you especially yesterday it awful she said looking at anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul 
 yes i had no idea it would be so thrilling said anna blushing 
 the company got up at this moment to go into the garden 
 not going said liza smiling and settling herself close to anna you go either will you who wants to play croquet 
 oh i like it said anna 
 there how do you manage never to be bored by things one has but to look at you to be joyful alive but bored 
 how can you be bored why you live among the merriest people in peterburg said anna 
 possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored but we are not amused ourselves i certainly am not but awfully awfully bored 
 sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men betsy and stremov remained at the tea table 
 you bored said betsy sappho says they enjoyed themselves tremendously at your house last night 
 ah how dreary it all was said liza merkalova we all drove back to my place after the races and always the same people always the same always the same thing we lounged about on sofas all the evening enjoyable about that no do tell me how you manage never to be bored she said addressing anna again one has but to look at you and one sees a woman who may be happy or unhappy but who bored tell me how do you do it 
 i do nothing answered anna blushing at these searching questions 
 the best way stremov put in 
 stremov was a man of fifty partly gray but still vigorous in appearance very ugly but with a characteristic and intelligent face liza merkalova was his niece and he spent all his leisure hours with her on meeting anna karenina since he was alexei enemy in the government he tried like a shrewd man and a man of the world to be particularly cordial with her the wife of his enemy 
 nothing he put in with a subtle smile the very best way i told you long ago he said turning to liza merkalova that in order not to be bored you think going to be bored just as you be afraid of not being able to fall asleep if afraid of sleeplessness precisely what anna arkadyevna has just said 
 i should be very glad if i had said it for not only clever but true said anna smiling 
 no do tell me why it is one go to sleep and one help being bored 
 to sleep well one should work and to enjoy oneself one should also work 
 what am i to work for when my work is of no use to anybody and i and knowingly make a pretense at it 
 incorrigible said stremov without looking at her and he spoke again to anna 
 as he rarely met anna he could say nothing but banalities to her but he said those banalities when was she returning to peterburg and how fond countess lidia ivanovna was of her with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that 
 tushkevich came in announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet 
 no go away please pleaded liza merkalova hearing that anna was going stremov joined in her entreaties 
 too violent a transition he said to go from such company to old madame vrede and besides you will only give her a chance for talking scandal while here you will arouse other feelings of the finest and directly opposed to scandal he said to her 
 anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty this shrewd flattering words the naive childlike affection shown her by liza merkalova and all the worldly atmosphere she was used to it was all so easy while that which was in store for her was so difficult that she was for a minute in uncertainty should she remain should she put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation but remembering what was in store for her when she would be alone at home if she did not come to some decision remembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched her hair in both hands she said and went away

 ah how dreary it all was said liza merkalova we all drove back to my place after the races and always the same people always the same always the same thing we lounged about on sofas all the evening enjoyable about that no do tell me how you manage never to be bored she said addressing anna again one has but to look at you and one sees a woman who may be happy or unhappy but who bored tell me how do you do it 
 i do nothing answered anna blushing at these searching questions 
 the best way stremov put in 
 stremov was a man of fifty partly gray but still vigorous in appearance very ugly but with a characteristic and intelligent face liza merkalova was his niece and he spent all his leisure hours with her on meeting anna karenina since he was alexei enemy in the government he tried like a shrewd man and a man of the world to be particularly cordial with her the wife of his enemy 
 nothing he put in with a subtle smile the very best way i told you long ago he said turning to liza merkalova that in order not to be bored you think going to be bored just as you be afraid of not being able to fall asleep if afraid of sleeplessness precisely what anna arkadyevna has just said 
 i should be very glad if i had said it for not only clever but true said anna smiling 
 no do tell me why it is one go to sleep and one help being bored 
 to sleep well one should work and to enjoy oneself one should also work 
 what am i to work for when my work is of no use to anybody and i and knowingly make a pretense at it 
 incorrigible said stremov without looking at her and he spoke again to anna 
 as he rarely met anna he could say nothing but banalities to her but he said those banalities when was she returning to peterburg and how fond countess lidia ivanovna was of her with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that 
 tushkevich came in announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet 
 no go away please pleaded liza merkalova hearing that anna was going stremov joined in her entreaties 
 too violent a transition he said to go from such company to old madame vrede and besides you will only give her a chance for talking scandal while here you will arouse other feelings of the finest and directly opposed to scandal he said to her 
 anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty this shrewd flattering words the naive childlike affection shown her by liza merkalova and all the worldly atmosphere she was used to it was all so easy while that which was in store for her was so difficult that she was for a minute in uncertainty should she remain should she put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation but remembering what was in store for her when she would be alone at home if she did not come to some decision remembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched her hair in both hands she said and went away

 they heard the sound of steps and a voice then a voice and laughter and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests sappho stoltz and a young man beaming with excess of health the vaska it was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak truffles and burgundy were profitable for his health vaska bowed to the two ladies and glanced at them but only for one second he walked after sappho into the drawing room and followed her about as though he were chained to her keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her sappho stoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes she walked with smart little steps in shoes and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man 
 anna had never met this new star of fashion and was struck by her beauty the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried and the boldness of her manners on her head there was such an echafaudage of soft golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust of which so much was exposed in front the impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress and the question involuntarily rose in mind where in the undulating mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman so small and slender so naked in front and so hidden behind and below really came to an end 
 betsy made haste to introduce her to anna 
 only fancy we all but ran over two soldiers she began telling them at once using her eyes smiling and twitching away her train which she at first threw too much to one side i drove here with vaska ah to be sure you know each other and mentioning his surname she introduced the young man and reddening broke into a ringing laugh at her mistake that is at her having called him vaska before a stranger vaska bowed once more to anna but he said nothing to her he addressed sappho lost your bet we got here first pay up said he smiling 
 sappho laughed still more festively 
 not just now said she 
 all one have it later 
 very well very well oh yes she turned suddenly to princess betsy i am a nice person i positively forgot it brought you a visitor and here he comes 
 the unexpected young visitor whom sappho had brought with her and whom she had forgotten was however a personage of such consequence that in spite of his youth both the ladies rose on his entrance 
 he was a new admirer of like vaska he now dogged her footsteps 
 soon after prince kaluzhsky arrived and liza merkalova with stremov liza merkalova was a thin brunette with an oriental languid type of face and charming as everyone used to say ineffable eyes the tone of her dark dress anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty liza was as soft and loose as sappho was tight and shackled 
 but to taste liza was far more attractive betsy had said to anna that she had adopted the pose of an unsophisticated child but when anna saw her she felt this was not the truth she really was unsophisticated spoiled yet a sweet and irresponsible woman it is true that her tone was the same as that like sappho she had two men one young and one old tacked on to her and devouring her with their eyes but there was something in her higher than her surroundings there was in her the glow of the real diamond among paste this glow shone out in her charming truly ineffable eyes the weary and at the same time passionate glance of those eyes encircled by dark rings impressed one by its perfect sincerity everyone looking into those eyes fancied he knew her wholly and knowing her could not but love her at the sight of anna her whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight 
 ah how glad i am to see you she said going up to her yesterday at the races i wanted just to get to you but gone away i did so want to see you especially yesterday it awful she said looking at anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul 
 yes i had no idea it would be so thrilling said anna blushing 
 the company got up at this moment to go into the garden 
 not going said liza smiling and settling herself close to anna you go either will you who wants to play croquet 
 oh i like it said anna 
 there how do you manage never to be bored by things one has but to look at you to be joyful alive but bored 
 how can you be bored why you live among the merriest people in peterburg said anna 
 possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored but we are not amused ourselves i certainly am not but awfully awfully bored 
 sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men betsy and stremov remained at the tea table 
 you bored said betsy sappho says they enjoyed themselves tremendously at your house last night 
 ah how dreary it all was said liza merkalova we all drove back to my place after the races and always the same people always the same always the same thing we lounged about on sofas all the evening enjoyable about that no do tell me how you manage never to be bored she said addressing anna again one has but to look at you and one sees a woman who may be happy or unhappy but who bored tell me how do you do it

 in spite of apparently frivolous life in society he was a man who hated disorder in early youth in the corps of pages he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal when he had tried being in difficulties to borrow money and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again 
 in order to keep his affairs in some sort of order he was wont about five times a year more or less frequently according to circumstances to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape this he would call his day of washing up or faire la lessive 
 on waking up late in the morning after the races vronsky put on a white linen coat and without shaving or taking his bath he distributed about the table money bills and letters and set to work petritsky who knew he was on such occasions on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing table quietly dressed and went out without getting in his way 
 every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions and the difficulty of making them clear is something exceptional and personal peculiar to himself and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is so indeed it seemed to vronsky and not without inward pride and not without reason he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties and would have been forced to some dishonorable course if he had found himself in such a difficult position but vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into difficulties 
 what vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary position writing out on note paper in his minute handwriting all that he owed he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds which he left out for the sake of clearness reckoning up his cash and the balance in his bankbook he found that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles and nothing coming in before the new year reckoning over again his list of debts vronsky copied it dividing it into three classes in the first class he put the debts which he would have to pay at once or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there would not be a delay in paying such debts amounted to about four thousand one thousand five hundred for a horse and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade venevsky who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in presence vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time he had that amount then but venevsky and iashvin had insisted that they would pay and not vronsky who had not played so far so good but vronsky knew that in this dirty business though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for venevsky it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the cheat and have no more words with him and so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles the second class eight thousand roubles consisted of less important debts these were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses to the purveyor of oats and hay the englishman the saddler and so on he would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too in order to be quite free from anxiety the last class of debts to shops to hotels to his tailor were such as need not be considered so that he needed at least six thousand roubles and he only had one thousand eight hundred for current expenses for a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue which was what everyone fixed as income such debts one would suppose could hardly be embarrassing but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand his immense property which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand was left undivided between the brothers at the time when the elder brother with a mass of debts had married princess varia chirkova the daughter of a dekabrist without any fortune whatever alexei had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his estate reserving for himself only thousand a year from it alexei had said at the time to his brother that the sum would be sufficient for him until he married which he would probably never do and his brother who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments and was only just married could not decline the gift his mother who had her own separate property had allowed alexei every year twenty thousand in addition to the thousand he had reserved and alexei had spent it all of late his mother incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving moscow had given up sending him the money and in consequence of this vronsky who had been in the habit of living on the scale of thousand a year having only received twenty thousand that year now found himself in difficulties to get out of these difficulties he could not apply to his mother for money her last letter which he had received the day before had particularly exasperated him by the hints it contained that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the army but not to lead a life which scandalized all good society his attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever toward her but he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered even though he felt now vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his liaison with madame karenina that his generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income but it was impossible to draw back he had only to recall his wife to remember how that sweet delightful varia sought at every convenient opportunity to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift it was as impossible as beating a woman or stealing or lying one thing only could and ought to be done and vronsky determined upon it without an hesitation to borrow money from a moneylender ten thousand roubles a proceeding which presented no difficulty to cut down his expenses generally and to sell his race horses resolving on this he promptly wrote a note to rolandaky who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him then he sent for the englishman and the moneylender and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay having finished this business he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother then he took out of his notebook three notes of read them again burned them and remembering their conversation on the previous day he sank

 life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do this code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies but then the principles were never doubtful and vronsky as he never went outside that circle had never had a hesitation about doing what he ought to do these principles laid down as invariable rules that one must pay a cardsharper but need not pay a tailor that one must never tell a lie to a man but one may to a woman that one must never cheat anyone but one may a husband that one must never pardon an insult but one may give one and so on these principles were possibly not reasonable and not good but they were of unfailing certainty and so long as he adhered to them vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up but of late in regard to his relations with anna vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue 
 his present relation to anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple it was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided 
 she was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him and he loved her and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same respect or even more than a lawful wife he would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word by a hint to humiliate her or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for 
 his attitude toward society too was clear everyone might know might suspect it but no one might dare to speak of it if any did speak he was ready to force all who might do so to be silent and to respect the nonexistent honor of the woman he loved 
 his attitude to the husband was the clearest of all from the moment that anna loved vronsky he had regarded his own right over her as the one thing unassailable her husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person no doubt he was in a pitiable position but how could that be helped the one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand and vronsky was prepared for this at any minute 
 but of late new inner relations had arisen between her and him which frightened vronsky by their indefiniteness only the day before she had told him that she was with child and he felt that this fact and what she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life and he had been indeed caught unawares and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband he had said that but now thinking things over he saw clearly that it would be better to manage avoiding that and at the same time as he told himself this he was afraid whether such an avoidance were not wrong 
 if i told her to leave her husband it would mean uniting her life with mine am i prepared for that how can i take her away now when i have no money supposing i could arrange but how can i take her away while in the service if i say it i ought to be prepared to do it that is i ought to have the money and to retire from the army 
 and he grew thoughtful the question whether to retire from the service or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life of which none knew but he 
 ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood a dream which he did not confess even to himself though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his love his first steps in the world and in the service had been successful but two years before he had made a great mistake anxious to show his independence and for the sake of advancement he had refused a post that had been offered him hoping that this refusal would heighten his value but it turned out that he had been too bold and he was passed over and having whether he liked or not taken up for himself the position of an independent man he carried it off with great tact and good sense behaving as though he bore no grudge against anyone nor regarding himself as injured in any way and caring for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself in reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before when he had gone to moscow he felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done anything but cared to do nothing was already beginning to pall that many people were beginning to fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a straightforward fellow his connection with madame karenina by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention had given him a fresh distinction which had soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while but a week ago that worm had been roused up again with fresh force the friend of his childhood a man of the same set of the same coterie his comrade in the corps of pages serpukhovskoy who had left school with him and had been his rival in class in gymnastics in their scrapes and their dreams of glory had come back a few days before from central asia where he had gained two steps up in rank and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young

 chapter 
 
 come to fetch you your lessive lasted a good time today said petritsky well is it over 
 over answered vronsky smiling with his eyes only and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it 
 always just as if come out of a bath after it said petritsky come from gritzka that was what they called the colonel expected there 
 vronsky without answering looked at his comrade thinking of something else 
 yes is that music at his place he said listening to the familiar bass sounds of trumpets of polkas and waltzes floating across to him the fete 
 come 
 aha said vronsky why i know 
 the smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever 
 having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love that he sacrificed his ambition to it at any rate having taken up this role vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of serpukhovskoy or vexed at him for not having come to him first upon coming to the regiment serpukhovskoy was a good friend and he was delighted he had come 
 ah very glad 
 the colonel demin had taken a large country house the whole party was on the wide lower balcony in the courtyard the first objects that met eyes were a band of singers in short white linen jackets standing near a barrel of vodka and the robust figure of the colonel surrounded by officers he had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting to drown out the band playing an offenbach quadrille waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side a group of soldiers a quartermaster and several subalterns came up to the balcony with vronsky the colonel returned to the table went out again on the steps with a tumbler in his hand and proposed the toast to the health of our former comrade the gallant general prince serpukhovskoy hurrah 
 the colonel was followed by serpukhovskoy who came out on the steps smiling with a glass in his hand 
 you always get younger bondarenko he said to the sergeant standing just before him still though doing his second term of service 
 it was three years since vronsky had seen serpukhovskoy he looked more robust had let his whiskers grow but was still the same graceful creature whose face and figure were even more striking from their fineness and nobility than their beauty the only change vronsky detected in him was that subdued continual beaming which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone vronsky knew that radiant air and immediately observed it in serpukhovskoy 
 as serpukhovskoy came down the steps he saw vronsky a smile of pleasure lighted up his face he tossed his head upward and waved the glass in his hand greeting vronsky and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before kissing the sergeant who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed 
 here he is shouted the colonel iashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers 
 serpukhovskoy kissed the moist fresh lips of the brave sergeant and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief walked up to vronsky 
 how glad i am he said squeezing his hand and drawing him to one side 
 you look after him the colonel shouted to iashvin pointing to vronsky and he went down below to the soldiers 
 why you at the races yesterday i expected to see you there said vronsky scrutinizing serpukhovskoy 
 i did go but late i beg your pardon he added and turned to the adjutant please have this distributed from me each man as much as it comes to 
 and he hurriedly took three notes for a hundred roubles each from his pocketbook and blushed 
 vronsky have a bite or a drink asked iashvin hi something for the count to eat there drink that 
 the spree at the lasted a long while 
 there was a great deal of drinking they swung serpukhovskoy and tossed him in the air then they did the same to the colonel then to the accompaniment of the band the colonel himself danced with petritsky then the colonel who began to show signs of weakening sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to iashvin the superiority of russia over prussia especially in cavalry attack and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment serpukhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found vronsky there vronsky was sousing his head with water he had taken off his coat and put his red hairy neck under the tap and was rubbing it and his head with his hands when he had finished vronsky sat down by serpukhovskoy they both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them 
 always been hearing about you through my wife said serpukhovskoy glad been seeing her pretty often 
 friendly with varia and the only women in peterburg i care about seeing answered vronsky smiling he smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn to and he was glad of it 
 the only ones serpukhovskoy queried smiling 
 yes and i heard news of you but not only through your wife said vronsky checking hint by assuming a stern expression i was greatly delighted to hear of your success but not a bit surprised i expected even more 
 serpukhovskoy smiled such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him and he did not think it necessary to conceal it 
 well i on the contrary expected less own up frankly but glad very glad ambitious my weakness and i confess to it 
 perhaps you confess to it if you been successful said vronsky 
 i suppose so said serpukhovskoy smiling again i say life be worth living without it but it would be dull of course i may be mistaken but i fancy i have a certain capacity for the line chosen and that if there is to be power of any sort in my hands it will be better than in the hands of a good many people i know said serpukhovskoy with beaming consciousness of success and so the nearer i get to it the better pleased i am 
 perhaps that is true for you but not for everyone i used to think so too but now i see and think life worth living not only for that 
 there it comes there it comes said serpukhovskoy laughing ever since i heard about you about your refusal i began of course i approved of what you did but there are ways of doing everything and i think your action was good in itself but you do it in quite the way you should have done 
 done be undone and you know i never go back on what done and besides very well off 
 very well off for the time but not satisfied with that i say this to your brother a charming child like our host here there he goes he added listening to the roar of a hurrah and happy that does not satisfy you 
 i say it did 
 yes but not the only thing such men as you are wanted 
 by whom 
 by whom by society by russia russia needs men she needs a party or else everything goes and will go to the dogs 
 how do you mean party against the russian communists 
 no said serpukhovskoy frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity tout a est une blague that has always been and always will be there are no communists but intriguing people have to invent a noxious dangerous party an old trick no wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me 
 but why so vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power why they independent men 
 simply because they have not or have not had from birth an independent fortune not had a name they born close to the sun as we were they can be bought either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a trend and they bring forward some notion some trend that they believe in that does harm and the whole policy is really only a means to a house at the expense of the crown and so much income cela pas plus fin que a when you get a peep at their cards i may be inferior to them more stupid perhaps though i see why i should be inferior to them but you and i have one important certain advantage over them in being more difficult to buy and such men are more needed than ever 
 vronsky listened attentively but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of serpukhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers and already had his likes and dislikes in that world while his own interest in his service did not go beyond the interests of his squadron vronsky felt too how powerful serpukhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in through his intelligence and gift of eloquence so rarely met with in the world in which he moved and ashamed as he was of the feeling he felt envious 
 still i the one thing of paramount importance for that he answered i the desire for power i had it once but gone 
 excuse me not true said serpukhovskoy smiling 
 yes true true now to be truthful vronsky added 
 yes true now another thing but that now last forever 
 perhaps answered vronsky 
 you say perhaps serpukhovskoy went on as though guessing his thoughts but i say for certain and what i wanted to see you for your action was just what it should have been i see that but you ought not to persevere in it i only ask you to give me carte blanche not going to offer you my protection though indeed why i protect you protected me often enough i should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing yes he said smiling to him as tenderly as a woman give me carte blanche retire from the regiment and get you in imperceptibly 
 but you must understand that i want nothing said vronsky except to leave things just as they were 
 serpukhovskoy got up and stood facing him 
 you said leave things just as they were i understand what that means but listen the same age known a greater number of women perhaps than i have smile and gestures told vronsky that he be afraid that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place but married and believe me in getting to know wife thoroughly if one loves her as someone has said one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them 
 coming directly vronsky shouted to an officer who looked into the room and called them to the colonel 
 vronsky was longing now to hear serpukhovskoy to the end and know what he would say to him 
 and my opinion for you women are the chief stumbling block in a career hard to love a woman and do anything only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance marriage now how am i to tell you what i mean said serpukhovskoy who liked similes wait wait a minute yes just as you can only carry a fardeau yet do something with your hands when the fardeau is tied on your back and marriage and what i felt when i was married my hands were suddenly set free but if you drag that fardeau about with you without marriage your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing look at mazankov at krupov ruined their careers for the sake of women 
 what women said vronsky recalling the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected 
 the firmer the footing in society the worse it is much the same as not merely carrying the fardeau in your arms but tearing it away from someone else

 come to fetch you your lessive lasted a good time today said petritsky well is it over 
 over answered vronsky smiling with his eyes only and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it 
 always just as if come out of a bath after it said petritsky come from gritzka that was what they called the colonel expected there 
 vronsky without answering looked at his comrade thinking of something else 
 yes is that music at his place he said listening to the familiar bass sounds of trumpets of polkas and waltzes floating across to him the fete 
 come 
 aha said vronsky why i know 
 the smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever 
 having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love that he sacrificed his ambition to it at any rate having taken up this role vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of serpukhovskoy or vexed at him for not having come to him first upon coming to the regiment serpukhovskoy was a good friend and he was delighted he had come 
 ah very glad 
 the colonel demin had taken a large country house the whole party was on the wide lower balcony in the courtyard the first objects that met eyes were a band of singers in short white linen jackets standing near a barrel of vodka and the robust figure of the colonel surrounded by officers he had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting to drown out the band playing an offenbach quadrille waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side a group of soldiers a quartermaster and several subalterns came up to the balcony with vronsky the colonel returned to the table went out again on the steps with a tumbler in his hand and proposed the toast to the health of our former comrade the gallant general prince serpukhovskoy hurrah 
 the colonel was followed by serpukhovskoy who came out on the steps smiling with a glass in his hand 
 you always get younger bondarenko he said to the sergeant standing just before him still though doing his second term of service 
 it was three years since vronsky had seen serpukhovskoy he looked more robust had let his whiskers grow but was still the same graceful creature whose face and figure were even more striking from their fineness and nobility than their beauty the only change vronsky detected in him was that subdued continual beaming which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone vronsky knew that radiant air and immediately observed it in serpukhovskoy 
 as serpukhovskoy came down the steps he saw vronsky a smile of pleasure lighted up his face he tossed his head upward and waved the glass in his hand greeting vronsky and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before kissing the sergeant who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed 
 here he is shouted the colonel iashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers 
 serpukhovskoy kissed the moist fresh lips of the brave sergeant and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief walked up to vronsky 
 how glad i am he said squeezing his hand and drawing him to one side 
 you look after him the colonel shouted to iashvin pointing to vronsky and he went down below to the soldiers 
 why you at the races yesterday i expected to see you there said vronsky scrutinizing serpukhovskoy 
 i did go but late i beg your pardon he added and turned to the adjutant please have this distributed from me each man as much as it comes to 
 and he hurriedly took three notes for a hundred roubles each from his pocketbook and blushed 
 vronsky have a bite or a drink asked iashvin hi something for the count to eat there drink that 
 the spree at the lasted a long while 
 there was a great deal of drinking they swung serpukhovskoy and tossed him in the air then they did the same to the colonel then to the accompaniment of the band the colonel himself danced with petritsky then the colonel who began to show signs of weakening sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to iashvin the superiority of russia over prussia especially in cavalry attack and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment serpukhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found vronsky there vronsky was sousing his head with water he had taken off his coat and put his red hairy neck under the tap and was rubbing it and his head with his hands when he had finished vronsky sat down by serpukhovskoy they both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them 
 always been hearing about you through my wife said serpukhovskoy glad been seeing her pretty often 
 friendly with varia and the only women in peterburg i care about seeing answered vronsky smiling he smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn to and he was glad of it 
 the only ones serpukhovskoy queried smiling 
 yes and i heard news of you but not only through your wife said vronsky checking hint by assuming a stern expression i was greatly delighted to hear of your success but not a bit surprised i expected even more 
 serpukhovskoy smiled such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him and he did not think it necessary to conceal it 
 well i on the contrary expected less own up frankly but glad very glad ambitious my weakness and i confess to it 
 perhaps you confess to it if you been successful said vronsky 
 i suppose so said serpukhovskoy smiling again i say life be worth living without it but it would be dull of course i may be mistaken but i fancy i have a certain capacity for the line chosen and that if there is to be power of any sort in my hands it will be better than in the hands of a good many people i know said serpukhovskoy with beaming consciousness of success and so the nearer i get to it the better pleased i am 
 perhaps that is true for you but not for everyone i used to think so too but now i see and think life worth living not only for that 
 there it comes there it comes said serpukhovskoy laughing ever since i heard about you about your refusal i began of course i approved of what you did but there are ways of doing everything and i think your action was good in itself but you do it in quite the way you should have done 
 done be undone and you know i never go back on what done and besides very well off 
 very well off for the time but not satisfied with that i say this to your brother a charming child like our host here there he goes he added listening to the roar of a hurrah and happy that does not satisfy you 
 i say it did 
 yes but not the only thing such men as you are wanted 
 by whom 
 by whom by society by russia russia needs men she needs a party or else everything goes and will go to the dogs 
 how do you mean party against the russian communists 
 no said serpukhovskoy frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity tout a est une blague that has always been and always will be there are no communists but intriguing people have to invent a noxious dangerous party an old trick no wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me 
 but why so vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power why they independent men 
 simply because they have not or have not had from birth an independent fortune not had a name they born close to the sun as we were they can be bought either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a trend and they bring forward some notion some trend that they believe in that does harm and the whole policy is really only a means to a house at the expense of the crown and so much income cela pas plus fin que a when you get a peep at their cards i may be inferior to them more stupid perhaps though i see why i should be inferior to them but you and i have one important certain advantage over them in being more difficult to buy and such men are more needed than ever 
 vronsky listened attentively but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of serpukhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers and already had his likes and dislikes in that world while his own interest in his service did not go beyond the interests of his squadron vronsky felt too how powerful serpukhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in through his intelligence and gift of eloquence so rarely met with in the world in which he moved and ashamed as he was of the feeling he felt envious 
 still i the one thing of paramount importance for that he answered i the desire for power i had it once but gone 
 excuse me not true said serpukhovskoy smiling 
 yes true true now to be truthful vronsky added 
 yes true now another thing but that now last forever 
 perhaps answered vronsky 
 you say perhaps serpukhovskoy went on as though guessing his thoughts but i say for certain and what i wanted to see you for your action was just what it should have been i see that but you ought not to persevere in it i only ask you to give me carte blanche not going to offer you my protection though indeed why i protect you protected me often enough i should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing yes he said smiling to him as tenderly as a woman give me carte blanche retire from the regiment and get you in imperceptibly 
 but you must understand that i want nothing said vronsky except to leave things just as they were 
 serpukhovskoy got up and stood facing him 
 you said leave things just as they were i understand what that means but listen the same age known a greater number of women perhaps than i have smile and gestures told vronsky that he be afraid that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place but married and believe me in getting to know wife thoroughly if one loves her as someone has said one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them 
 coming directly vronsky shouted to an officer who looked into the room and called them to the colonel 
 vronsky was longing now to hear serpukhovskoy to the end and know what he would say to him 
 and my opinion for you women are the chief stumbling block in a career hard to love a woman and do anything only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance marriage now how am i to tell you what i mean said serpukhovskoy who liked similes wait wait a minute yes just as you can only carry a fardeau yet do something with your hands when the fardeau is tied on your back and marriage and what i felt when i was married my hands were suddenly set free but if you drag that fardeau about with you without marriage your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing look at mazankov at krupov ruined their careers for the sake of women 
 what women said vronsky recalling the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected 
 the firmer the footing in society the worse it is much the same as not merely carrying the fardeau in your arms but tearing it away from someone else 
 you have never loved vronsky said softly looking straight before him and thinking of anna 
 perhaps but you remember what said to you and another thing women are all more materialistic than men we make something immense out of love but they are always

 it was six already and so in order to be there quickly and at the same time not to drive with his own horses known to everyone vronsky got into hackney coach and told the coachman to drive as quickly as possible it was a roomy coach with seats for four he sat in one corner stretched his legs out on the front seat and sank into deep thought 
 a vague sense of the clearness to which his affairs had been brought a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of serpukhovskoy who had considered him a man who was needed and most of all the anticipation of the meeting before him all blended into a general joyous sense of life this feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling he dropped his legs crossed one leg over the other knee and taking it in his hand felt the springy muscle of the calf where it had been grazed the day before by his fall and leaning back he drew several deep breaths 
 happy very happy he said to himself he had often before had this sense of physical joy in his own body but he had never felt so fond of himself of his own body as at that moment he enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg he enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed the bright cold august day which had made anna feel so hopeless seemed to him keenly stimulating and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water the scent of brilliantine on his mustaches struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh air everything he saw from the carriage window everything in that cold pure air in the pale light of the sunset was as fresh and gay and strong as he was himself the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings the figures of and carriages that met him now and then the motionless green of the trees and grass the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses and trees and bushes and even from the rows of potatoes everything was bright like a pretty landscape freshly painted and varnished 
 get on get on he said to the driver putting his head out of the window and pulling a note out of his pocket he handed it to the man as he looked round the hand fumbled with something at the lamp the whip cracked and the coach rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad 
 i want nothing nothing but this happiness he thought staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows and picturing to himself anna just as he had seen her last time and as i go on i love her more and more the garden of the crown villa whereabouts will she be where how why did she fix on this place to meet me and why does she write in letter he thought now for the first time wondering at it but there was now no time for wonder he called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue and opening the door jumped out of the carriage as it was moving and went up the avenue that led to the house there was no one in the avenue but looking round to the right he caught sight of her her face was hidden by a veil but he drank in with glad eyes the special movement in walking peculiar to her alone the slope of her shoulders and the setting of her head and at once a sort of electric shock ran all over him with fresh force he felt conscious of himself from the springy movements of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he breathed and something set his lips twitching 
 joining him she pressed his hand tightly 
 not angry because i sent for you i absolutely had to see you she said and the serious and set line of her lips which he saw under the veil transformed his mood at once 
 i angry but how have you come where 
 never mind she said laying her hand on his arm come along i must talk to you 
 he saw that something had happened and that the interview would not be a joyous one in her presence he had no will of his own without knowing the grounds of her distress he already felt the same distress unconsciously passing over him 
 what is it what he asked her squeezing her hand with his elbow and trying to read her thoughts in her face 
 she walked on a few steps in silence gathering up her courage then suddenly she stopped 
 i did not tell you yesterday she began breathing quickly and painfully that coming home with alexei alexandrovich i told him everything told him i could not be his wife that and told him everything 
 he heard her unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for her but directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up and a proud and hard expression came over his face 
 
 yes yes better a thousand times better i know how painful it was he said but she was not listening to his words she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face she could not guess that that arose from the first idea that presented itself to vronsky that a duel was now inevitable the idea of a duel had never crossed her mind and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness 
 when she got her letter she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position to abandon her son and to join her lover the morning spent at princess had confirmed her still more in this but this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her she hoped that this interview would transform her position and save her if on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely passionately without an wavering throw up everything and come with me she would give up her son and go away with him but this news had not produced on him the effect she had expected he simply seemed resentful of some affront 
 it was not in the least painful for me it happened of itself she said irritably and see she pulled her letter out of her glove 
 i understand i understand he interrupted her taking the letter but not reading it and trying to soothe her the one thing i longed for the one thing i prayed for was to cut short this position so as to devote my life to your happiness 
 why do you tell me that she said do you suppose i can doubt it if i doubted 
 that coming said vronsky suddenly pointing to two ladies walking toward them perhaps they know us and he hurriedly turned off drawing her after him into a side path 
 oh i care she said her lips were quivering and he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under her veil i tell you not the point i doubt that but see what he writes me read it she stood still again 
 again just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband vronsky on reading the letter was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the injured husband now while he held his letter in his hands he could not help picturing the challenge which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow and the duel itself in which with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured shot after having himself fired into the air and at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what serpukhovskoy had just said to him and what he had himself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind himself and he knew that he could not tell her this thought 
 having read the letter he raised his eyes to her and there was no firmness in them she saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself she knew that whatever he might say to her he would not say all he thought and she knew that her last hope had failed her this was not what she had been looking for 
 you see the sort of man he is she said with a shaking voice he 
 forgive me but i rejoice at it vronsky interrupted for sake let me finish he added his eyes imploring her to give him time to explain his words i rejoice because things cannot cannot possibly remain as he supposes 
 why they anna said restraining her tears and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said she felt that her fate was sealed 
 vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable he thought things could not go on as before but he said something different 
 it go on i hope that now you will leave him i hope he was confused and reddened that you will let me arrange and plan our life tomorrow he was beginning 
 she did not let him go on 
 but my child she shrieked you see what he writes i should have to leave him and i and do that 
 but for sake which is better to leave your child or keep up this degrading situation 
 to whom is it degrading 
 to all and most of all to you 
 you say degrading say that these words have no meaning for me she said in a shaking voice she did not want him now to say what was untrue she had nothing left her but his love and she wanted to love him you understand that from the day i loved you everything has changed for me for me there is one thing and one thing only your love if mine i feel so exalted so strong that nothing can be degrading to me i am proud of my position because proud of being proud she could not say what she was proud of tears of shame and despair choked her utterance she stood still and sobbed 
 he felt too something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping he could not have said exactly what it was touched him so he felt sorry for her and he felt he could not help her and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness and that he had done something wrong 
 a divorce possible he said feebly she shook her head without answering you take your son and still leave him 
 yes but it all depends on him now i must go to him she said shortly her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her 
 on tuesday i shall be in peterburg and everything can be settled 
 yes she said but let us talk any more of it 
 carriage which she had sent away and ordered to come back to the little gate of the vrede garden drove up anna said to vronsky and drove home

 again just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband vronsky on reading the letter was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the injured husband now while he held his letter in his hands he could not help picturing the challenge which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow and the duel itself in which with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured shot after having himself fired into the air and at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what serpukhovskoy had just said to him and what he had himself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind himself and he knew that he could not tell her this thought 
 having read the letter he raised his eyes to her and there was no firmness in them she saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself she knew that whatever he might say to her he would not say all he thought and she knew that her last hope had failed her this was not what she had been looking for 
 you see the sort of man he is she said with a shaking voice he 
 forgive me but i rejoice at it vronsky interrupted for sake let me finish he added his eyes imploring her to give him time to explain his words i rejoice because things cannot cannot possibly remain as he supposes 
 why they anna said restraining her tears and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said she felt that her fate was sealed 
 vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable he thought things could not go on as before but he said something different 
 it go on i hope that now you will leave him i hope he was confused and reddened that you will let me arrange and plan our life tomorrow he was beginning 
 she did not let him go on 
 but my child she shrieked you see what he writes i should have to leave him and i and do that 
 but for sake which is better to leave your child or keep up this degrading situation 
 to whom is it degrading 
 to all and most of all to you 
 you say degrading say that these words have no meaning for me she said in a shaking voice she did not want him now to say what was untrue she had nothing left her but his love and she wanted to love him you understand that from the day i loved you everything has changed for me for me there is one thing and one thing only your love if mine i feel so exalted so strong that nothing can be degrading to me i am proud of my position because proud of being proud she could not say what she was proud of tears of shame and despair choked her utterance she stood still and sobbed 
 he felt too something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping he could not have said exactly what it was touched him so he felt sorry for her and he felt he could not help her and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness and that he had done something wrong 
 a divorce possible he said feebly she shook her head without answering you take your son and still leave him 
 yes but it all depends on him now i must go to him she said shortly her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her 
 on tuesday i shall be in peterburg and everything can be settled 
 yes she said but let us talk any more of it 
 carriage which she had sent away and ordered to come back to the little gate of the vrede garden drove up anna said to vronsky and drove home

 on monday there was the usual session of the commission of the nd of june alexei alexandrovich walked into the hall where the session was held greeted the members and the president as usual and sat down in his place putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him among those papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make but he did not really need these documents he remembered every point and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say he knew that when the time came and when he saw his enemy facing him and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now he felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight meantime as he listened to the usual report he had the most innocent and inoffensive air no one looking at his white hands with their swollen veins and long fingers so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm set the members shouting and attacking one another and force the president to call for order when the report was over alexei alexandrovich announced in his subdued delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the organization of the native tribes all attention was turned upon him alexei alexandrovich cleared his throat and without looking at his opponent but selecting as he always did while he was delivering his speeches the first person sitting opposite him an inoffensive little old man who never had an opinion of any sort in the commission began to expound his views when he reached the point about the basic and organic law his opponent jumped up and began to protest stremov who was also a member of the commission and was also stung to the quick began defending himself and an altogether stormy session followed but alexei alexandrovich triumphed and his motion was carried three new commissions were appointed and the next day in a certain peterburg circle nothing else was talked of but this session alexei success had been even greater than he had anticipated 
 next morning tuesday alexei alexandrovich on awaking recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day and he could not help smiling though he tried to appear indifferent when the head clerk anxious to flatter him informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the commission 
 absorbed in business with the head clerk alexei alexandrovich had completely forgotten that it was tuesday the day fixed by him for the return of anna arkadyevna and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival 
 anna had arrived in peterburg early in the morning the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram and so alexei alexandrovich might have known of her arrival but when she arrived he did not meet her she was told that he had not yet gone out but was busy with the head clerk she sent word to her husband that she had come went to her own room and occupied herself in sorting out her things expecting he would come to her but an hour passed he did not come she went into the dining room on the pretext of giving some directions and spoke loudly on purpose expecting him to come out there but he did not come though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the head clerk she knew that he should before long go out to his office as usual and she wanted to see him before that so that their attitude to one another might be defined 
 she walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him when she went into his study he was in official uniform obviously ready to go out sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows looking dejectedly before him she saw him before he saw her and she knew that he was thinking of her 
 on seeing her he would have risen but changed his mind then his face flushed hotly a thing anna had never seen before and he got up quickly and went to meet her looking not at her eyes but above them at her forehead and hair he went up to her took her by the hand and asked her to sit down 
 i am very glad you have come he said sitting down beside her and obviously wishing to say something he stuttered several times he attempted to speak but stopped in spite of the fact that in preparing herself for meeting him she had schooled herself to despise and accuse him she did not know what to say to him and she felt pity for him and so the silence lasted rather long is seriozha quite well he said and without waiting for an answer he added i be dining at home today and i must go out directly 
 i had thought of going to moscow she said 
 no you did quite quite right to come he said and was silent again 
 seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation she began herself 
 alexei alexandrovich she said looking at him and without dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair a guilty woman a bad woman yet i am the same as i was as i told you then and i have come to tell you that i can change nothing 
 i asked you about that he said all at once resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face that was as i had supposed under the influence of anger he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties but as i told you then and have written to you he said in a thin shrill voice i repeat now that i am not bound to know this i ignore it not all wives are so kind as you to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands he laid special emphasis on the word agreeable i shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it so long as my name is not disgraced and so i simply inform you that our relations must be just as they have always been and that only in the event of your compromising yourself i shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor 
 but our relations cannot be the same as always anna began in a timid voice looking at him with dismay 
 when she saw once more those composed gestures heard that shrill childlike and sarcastic voice her aversion for him extinguished her pity for him and she felt only afraid but at all costs she wanted to make clear her position 
 i cannot be your wife while i she began 
 he laughed a cold and malignant laugh 
 the manner of life you have chosen is reflected i suppose in your ideas i have so much of both respect and contempt i respect your past and despise your present that i was far from the interpretation you put on my words 
 anna sighed and bowed her head 
 though indeed i fail to comprehend how with the independence you show he went on getting hot announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it apparently you can see anything reprehensible in performing a duties in relation to your husband 
 alexei alexandrovich what is it you want of me 
 i want never to meet that man here and i want you to conduct yourself so that neither society nor the servants could possibly reproach you i want you not to see him not much i think and in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties all i have to say to you now time for me to go not dining at home he got up and moved toward the door 
 anna got up too bowing in silence he let her pass before him

 the night spent by levin on the haycock did not pass without an effect upon him the way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and lost all attraction for him in spite of the magnificent harvest never had there been or at least it had never seemed so to him so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him the delight he had experienced in the work itself and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants the envy he felt of them of their life the desire to adopt that life which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention the execution of which he had thought out in detail all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it that he could not take his former interest in it and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople which was the foundation of it all the herd of improved cows such as pava the whole land plowed over and enriched the nine level fields surrounded with willow fences the ninety dessiatinas heavily manured drill plows and all the rest of it it was all splendid if only the work had been done by himself or by himself and his comrades by people in sympathy with him but he saw clearly now his work on a book of agriculture in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer greatly assisted him in this that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers in which there was on one side his side a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered better on the other side the natural order of things and in this struggle he saw that with immense expenditure of force on his side and with no effort or even intention on the other side the sole attainment was that the work did not go to the liking of either side and that splendid tools splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone worst of all the energy expended on this work was not merely wasted he could not help feeling now since the meaning of his system had become clear to him that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one in reality what was the struggle about he was struggling for every groat and he could not help it for he had only to relax his efforts and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers wages while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably that is to say as they were used to doing it it was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him so as to try not to break the winnowing machines the horse rakes the threshing machines that he should attend to what he was doing what the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible with rests and above all carelessly and heedlessly without thinking that summer levin saw this at every step he sent the men to mow some clover for hay picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed again and again they mowed his best dessiatinas of seed clover justifying themselves by the pretext that the bailiff had told them to and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would make splendid hay but he knew that it was because those dessiatinas were so much easier to mow he sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him and he was told trouble sure the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough the plows were practically useless because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the colter when he turned the plow and in forcing it round he tortured the horse and spoiled the ground and then begged levin not to mind it the horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer wanted to be night watchman and in spite of orders to the contrary the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty about the horses and when vanka after working all day long fell asleep he would say very penitent for his fault do what you will to me 
 three of the best heifers were allowed to overeat themselves to death by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to drenching them and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover but they told levin by way of consolation that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days all this happened not because anyone felt ill will to levin or to his farming on the contrary he knew that they liked him thinking him a simple gentleman their highest praise but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them but fatally opposed to their most just claims long before levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land he saw that his boat leaked but he did not look for the leak perhaps purposely deceiving himself but now he could deceive himself no longer the farming of the land as he was managing it had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him and he could take no further interest in it

 chapter 
 
 in the surovsky district there was neither railway nor mail coach and levin drove there with his own horses in his tarantass 
 he stopped halfway at a to feed his horses a bald old man with a broad red beard grizzled on his cheeks opened the gate squeezing against the gatepost to let the troika pass directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big clean tidy new yard with charred wooden plows in it the old man asked levin to come into the room a cleanly dressed young housewife with clogs on her bare feet was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room she was frightened by the dog that ran in after levin and uttered a shriek but began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the dog would not hurt her pointing out to levin with her bare arm the door into the room she bent down again hiding her handsome face and went on scrubbing 
 would you like a samovar she asked 
 yes please 
 the room was a big one with a tile stove and a partition dividing it into two under the icons stood a table painted in patterns a bench and two chairs near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery the shutters were closed there were few flies and it was so clean that levin was anxious that laska who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles should not muddy the floor and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door after looking round the room levin went out in the back yard the comely young housewife in clogs swinging the empty pails on the yoke ran on before him to the well for water 
 look sharp my girl the old man shouted after her and he walked up to levin well sir are you going to nikolai ivanovich sviiazhsky he comes to us too he began chatting leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps in the middle of the old account of his acquaintance with sviiazhsky the gates creaked again and laborers came into the yard from the fields with wooden plows and harrows the horses harnessed to the plows and harrows were sleek and fat the laborers were obviously of the household two were young men in shirts and caps the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts one an old man the other a young fellow 
 moving off from the steps the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them 
 what have they been plowing asked levin 
 plowing up the potatoes we rent a bit of land too fedot let out the gelding but take it to the trough and put another in harness 
 oh father about the plowshares i ordered has he brought them along asked the big robust fellow obviously the old son 
 there in the sledge answered the old man rolling up the reins he had taken off and flinging them on the ground you can put them right while they have dinner 
 the comely young housewife came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders more women came on the scene from somewhere young and handsome old and ugly with children and without children 
 the samovar was beginning to sing the laborers and the family having disposed of the horses came in to dinner levin getting his provisions out of his carriage invited the old man to take tea with him 
 well i have had some today already said the old man obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure well be it so for company 
 over their tea levin heard all about the old farming ten years before the old man had rented a hundred and twenty dessiatinas from the lady who owned them and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner a small part of the land the worst part he let out for rent while some forty dessiatinas of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers the old man complained that things were going badly but levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety and that his farm was in a flourishing condition if it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at a hundred and five roubles the dessiatina he would not have married off his three sons and a nephew he would not have rebuilt twice after fires and each time on a larger scale in spite of the old complaints it was evident that he was proud and justly proud of his prosperity proud of his sons his nephew his sons wives his horses and his cows and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going from his conversation with the old man levin realized he was not averse to new methods either he had planted a great many potatoes and his potatoes as levin had seen driving past were already past flowering and beginning to ripen whereas were only just coming into flower he plowed the ground for his potatoes with a modern plow borrowed from a neighboring landowner he sowed wheat the trifling fact that thinning out his rye the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses struck levin especially how many times had levin seen this splendid fodder wasted and tried to get it saved but always it had turned out to be impossible this peasant had done so and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts 
 what have the wenches to do they carry it out in bundles to the roadside and the cart brings it away 
 well we landowners manage well with our laborers said levin handing him a glass of tea 
 thanks said the old man and he took the glass but refused sugar pointing to a bit he had left no getting along with them said he simple waste look at sviiazhsky for instance we know what the like yet not much of a crop to boast of not looked after enough all it is 
 but you work your land with hired laborers 
 all peasants together we go into everything ourselves if a no use he can go and we can manage by ourselves 
 father finogen wants some tar said the young woman in the clogs coming in 
 yes yes how it is sir said the old man getting up and crossing himself lingeringly he thanked levin and went out 
 when levin went in the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family of men at dinner the women were standing up waiting on them the young robust son was telling something funny with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge and they were all laughing the woman in the clogs who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl laughing most merrily of all 
 very probably the comely face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of this peasant household made upon levin but the impression was so strong that levin could never get rid of it and all the way from the old to he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression demanding his special attention

 he stopped halfway at a to feed his horses a bald old man with a broad red beard grizzled on his cheeks opened the gate squeezing against the gatepost to let the troika pass directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big clean tidy new yard with charred wooden plows in it the old man asked levin to come into the room a cleanly dressed young housewife with clogs on her bare feet was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room she was frightened by the dog that ran in after levin and uttered a shriek but began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the dog would not hurt her pointing out to levin with her bare arm the door into the room she bent down again hiding her handsome face and went on scrubbing 
 would you like a samovar she asked 
 yes please 
 the room was a big one with a tile stove and a partition dividing it into two under the icons stood a table painted in patterns a bench and two chairs near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery the shutters were closed there were few flies and it was so clean that levin was anxious that laska who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles should not muddy the floor and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door after looking round the room levin went out in the back yard the comely young housewife in clogs swinging the empty pails on the yoke ran on before him to the well for water 
 look sharp my girl the old man shouted after her and he walked up to levin well sir are you going to nikolai ivanovich sviiazhsky he comes to us too he began chatting leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps in the middle of the old account of his acquaintance with sviiazhsky the gates creaked again and laborers came into the yard from the fields with wooden plows and harrows the horses harnessed to the plows and harrows were sleek and fat the laborers were obviously of the household two were young men in shirts and caps the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts one an old man the other a young fellow 
 moving off from the steps the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them 
 what have they been plowing asked levin 
 plowing up the potatoes we rent a bit of land too fedot let out the gelding but take it to the trough and put another in harness 
 oh father about the plowshares i ordered has he brought them along asked the big robust fellow obviously the old son 
 there in the sledge answered the old man rolling up the reins he had taken off and flinging them on the ground you can put them right while they have dinner 
 the comely young housewife came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders more women came on the scene from somewhere young and handsome old and ugly with children and without children 
 the samovar was beginning to sing the laborers and the family having disposed of the horses came in to dinner levin getting his provisions out of his carriage invited the old man to take tea with him 
 well i have had some today already said the old man obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure well be it so for company 
 over their tea levin heard all about the old farming ten years before the old man had rented a hundred and twenty dessiatinas from the lady who owned them and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner a small part of the land the worst part he let out for rent while some forty dessiatinas of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers the old man complained that things were going badly but levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety and that his farm was in a flourishing condition if it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at a hundred and five roubles the dessiatina he would not have married off his three sons and a nephew he would not have rebuilt twice after fires and each time on a larger scale in spite of the old complaints it was evident that he was proud and justly proud of his prosperity proud of his sons his nephew his sons wives his horses and his cows and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going from his conversation with the old man levin realized he was not averse to new methods either he had planted a great many potatoes and his potatoes as levin had seen driving past were already past flowering and beginning to ripen whereas were only just coming into flower he plowed the ground for his potatoes with a modern plow borrowed from a neighboring landowner he sowed wheat the trifling fact that thinning out his rye the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses struck levin especially how many times had levin seen this splendid fodder wasted and tried to get it saved but always it had turned out to be impossible this peasant had done so and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts 
 what have the wenches to do they carry it out in bundles to the roadside and the cart brings it away 
 well we landowners manage well with our laborers said levin handing him a glass of tea 
 thanks said the old man and he took the glass but refused sugar pointing to a bit he had left no getting along with them said he simple waste look at sviiazhsky for instance we know what the like yet not much of a crop to boast of not looked after enough all it is 
 but you work your land with hired laborers 
 all peasants together we go into everything ourselves if a no use he can go and we can manage by ourselves 
 father finogen wants some tar said the young woman in the clogs coming in 
 yes yes how it is sir said the old man getting up and crossing himself lingeringly he thanked levin and went out 
 when levin went in the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family of men at dinner the women were standing up waiting on them the young robust son was telling something funny with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge and they were all laughing the woman in the clogs who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl laughing most merrily of all 
 very probably the comely face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of this peasant household made upon levin but the impression was so strong that levin could never get rid of it and all the way from the old to he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression demanding his special attention

 sviiazhsky was the marshal of his district he was five years older than levin and had long been married his a young girl levin liked very much lived in his house and levin knew that sviiazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him he knew this with certainty as eligible young men always know it though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone and he also knew that although he wanted to get married and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife he could no more have married her even if he had not been in love with kitty shcherbatskaia than he could have flown up to the sky and this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to sviiazhsky 
 on getting letter with the invitation for shooting levin had immediately thought of this but in spite of it he had made up his mind that having such views for him was simply his own groundless supposition and so he would go notwithstanding besides at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself to put himself to the test in regard to this girl the sviiazhskys home life was exceedingly pleasant and sviiazhsky himself the best type of zemstvo man that levin knew was very interesting to him 
 sviiazhsky was one of those people always a source of wonder to levin whose convictions very logical though never original go one way by themselves while their life exceedingly definite and firm in its course goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions sviiazhsky was an extremely advanced man he despised the nobility and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom and only concealing their views out of cowardice he regarded russia as a ruined country rather after the style of turkey and the government of russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility and when he drove about he always wore his cap with the cockade and red band he considered human life only tolerable abroad and went abroad to stay at every opportunity and at the same time he carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in russia and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in russia he considered the russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man and at the same time in the days of zemstvo election no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion he believed neither in god nor the devil but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues and took special trouble to keep up the church in his village 
 on the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women and especially their right to labor but he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone and arranged his life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her preoccupations in spending their time as happily and as agreeably as possible 
 if it had not been a characteristic of levin to put the most favorable interpretation on people character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him he would have said to himself a fool or a knave and everything would have seemed clear but he could not say a fool because sviiazhsky was unmistakably clever and moreover a highly cultivated man who was exceptionally modest over his culture there was not a subject he knew nothing of but he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so still less could levin say that he was a knave as sviiazhsky was unmistakably an honest goodhearted sensible man who worked keenly and perseveringly at his work which was held in high honor by everyone about him and certainly he had never consciously done and was indeed incapable of doing anything base 
 levin tried to understand him and could not understand him and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma 
 levin and he were very friendly and so levin used to venture to sound sviiazhsky to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life but it was always in vain every time levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind which were hospitably open to all he noticed that sviiazhsky was slightly disconcerted faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes as though he were afraid levin would understand him and he would give him a kindly rebuff 
 just now since his disenchantment with farming levin was particularly glad to stay with sviiazhsky apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple so pleased with themselves and everyone else and their home had always a cheering effect on levin he felt a longing now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life to get at that secret in sviiazhsky which gave him such clarity definiteness and good courage in life moreover levin knew that at he would meet the landowners of the neighborhood and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops laborers wages and so on which levin was aware are conventionally regarded as something very low but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance it was not perhaps of importance in the days of serfdom and it may not be of importance in england in both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established but among us now when everything has been turned and is only just taking shape the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in russia thought levin 
 the shooting turned out to be poorer than levin expected the marsh was dry and there were no snipe at all he walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds but to make up for that he brought back as he always did from shooting an excellent appetite excellent spirits and that keen intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion and while out shooting when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all the old man and his family would time and again come to mind and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention but the solution of some question connected with them 
 in the evening at tea two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party and the interesting conversation levin had been looking forward to sprang up 
 levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister who was sitting opposite him madame sviiazhsky was a rather short woman all smiles and dimples levin tried through her to get at a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind but he had not complete freedom of ideas because he was in an agony of embarrassment this agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the was sitting opposite to him in a dress specially put on as he fancied for his benefit cut particularly open in the shape of a trapeze at her white bosom this quadrangular opening in spite of the being very white or just because it was very white deprived levin of the full use of his faculties he imagined probably mistakenly that this bodice had been made on his account and felt that he had no right to look at it and tried not to look at it but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the bodice having been made it seemed to levin that he had imposed upon someone that he ought to explain something but that to explain it was impossible and for that reason he was continually blushing was ill at ease and awkward his awkwardness infected the pretty too but their hostess appeared not to observe this and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation 
 you say she said pursuing the subject that had been started that my husband cannot be interested in russian quite the contrary he is in cheerful spirits abroad but never in such as he is here here he feels in his proper place he has so much to do and he has the faculty of interesting himself in everything oh not been to see our school have you 
 seen it the little house covered with ivy it 
 yes work she said indicating her sister 
 you teach in it yourself asked levin trying to look above the open neck but feeling that no matter where he looked in that direction he should see it 
 yes i used to teach in it myself and do teach still but we have a schoolmistress now and started gymnastic exercises 
 no thank you i have any more tea said levin and conscious of doing a rude thing but incapable of continuing the conversation he got up blushing i hear a very interesting conversation he added and walked to the other end of the table where sviiazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood sviiazhsky was sitting sideways with one elbow on the table and a cup in one hand while with the other hand he gathered up his beard held it to his nose and let it drop again as though he were smelling it his brilliant black eyes were looking directly at the excited country gentleman with gray mustaches and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks the gentleman was complaining of the peasants it was evident to levin that sviiazhsky knew the answer to this complaints which would at once demolish his whole contention but that in his position he could not give utterance to this answer and listened not without pleasure to the comic talk 
 the gentleman with the gray mustaches was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist who had lived all his life in the country levin saw proofs of this in his dress in his threadbare coat obviously not his everyday attire in his shrewd eyes in his coherent russian in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use and in the resolute gestures of his large beautiful sunburned hands with a single old wedding ring on his fourth finger

 sviiazhsky was the marshal of his district he was five years older than levin and had long been married his a young girl levin liked very much lived in his house and levin knew that sviiazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him he knew this with certainty as eligible young men always know it though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone and he also knew that although he wanted to get married and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife he could no more have married her even if he had not been in love with kitty shcherbatskaia than he could have flown up to the sky and this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to sviiazhsky 
 on getting letter with the invitation for shooting levin had immediately thought of this but in spite of it he had made up his mind that having such views for him was simply his own groundless supposition and so he would go notwithstanding besides at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself to put himself to the test in regard to this girl the sviiazhskys home life was exceedingly pleasant and sviiazhsky himself the best type of zemstvo man that levin knew was very interesting to him 
 sviiazhsky was one of those people always a source of wonder to levin whose convictions very logical though never original go one way by themselves while their life exceedingly definite and firm in its course goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions sviiazhsky was an extremely advanced man he despised the nobility and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom and only concealing their views out of cowardice he regarded russia as a ruined country rather after the style of turkey and the government of russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility and when he drove about he always wore his cap with the cockade and red band he considered human life only tolerable abroad and went abroad to stay at every opportunity and at the same time he carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in russia and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in russia he considered the russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man and at the same time in the days of zemstvo election no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion he believed neither in god nor the devil but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues and took special trouble to keep up the church in his village 
 on the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women and especially their right to labor but he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone and arranged his life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her preoccupations in spending their time as happily and as agreeably as possible 
 if it had not been a characteristic of levin to put the most favorable interpretation on people character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him he would have said to himself a fool or a knave and everything would have seemed clear but he could not say a fool because sviiazhsky was unmistakably clever and moreover a highly cultivated man who was exceptionally modest over his culture there was not a subject he knew nothing of but he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so still less could levin say that he was a knave as sviiazhsky was unmistakably an honest goodhearted sensible man who worked keenly and perseveringly at his work which was held in high honor by everyone about him and certainly he had never consciously done and was indeed incapable of doing anything base 
 levin tried to understand him and could not understand him and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma 
 levin and he were very friendly and so levin used to venture to sound sviiazhsky to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life but it was always in vain every time levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind which were hospitably open to all he noticed that sviiazhsky was slightly disconcerted faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes as though he were afraid levin would understand him and he would give him a kindly rebuff 
 just now since his disenchantment with farming levin was particularly glad to stay with sviiazhsky apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple so pleased with themselves and everyone else and their home had always a cheering effect on levin he felt a longing now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life to get at that secret in sviiazhsky which gave him such clarity definiteness and good courage in life moreover levin knew that at he would meet the landowners of the neighborhood and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops laborers wages and so on which levin was aware are conventionally regarded as something very low but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance it was not perhaps of importance in the days of serfdom and it may not be of importance in england in both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established but among us now when everything has been turned and is only just taking shape the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in russia thought levin 
 the shooting turned out to be poorer than levin expected the marsh was dry and there were no snipe at all he walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds but to make up for that he brought back as he always did from shooting an excellent appetite excellent spirits and that keen intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion and while out shooting when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all the old man and his family would time and again come to mind and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention but the solution of some question connected with them 
 in the evening at tea two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party and the interesting conversation levin had been looking forward to sprang up 
 levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister who was sitting opposite him madame sviiazhsky was a rather short woman all smiles and dimples levin tried through her to get at a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind but he had not complete freedom of ideas because he was in an agony of embarrassment this agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the was sitting opposite to him in a dress specially put on as he fancied for his benefit cut particularly open in the shape of a trapeze at her white bosom this quadrangular opening in spite of the being very white or just because it was very white deprived levin of the full use of his faculties he imagined probably mistakenly that this bodice had been made on his account and felt that he had no right to look at it and tried not to look at it but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the bodice having been made it seemed to levin that he had imposed upon someone that he ought to explain something but that to explain it was impossible and for that reason he was continually blushing was ill at ease and awkward his awkwardness infected the pretty too but their hostess appeared not to observe this and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation 
 you say she said pursuing the subject that had been started that my husband cannot be interested in russian quite the contrary he is in cheerful spirits abroad but never in such as he is here here he feels in his proper place he has so much to do and he has the faculty of interesting himself in everything oh not been to see our school have you

 if only the heart to throw up been set going such a lot of trouble wasted turn my back on the whole business sell out go off like nikolai ivanovich to hear la belle hlne said the landowner a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face 
 but you see you throw it up said nikolai ivanovich sviiazhsky so there must be something gained 
 the only gain is that i live in my own house neither bought nor hired besides one keeps hoping the people will learn sense though instead of that believe it or not there is such drunkenness such immorality they keep making partition of their bits of land there a horse or a cow the dying of hunger but just go and take him on as a laborer do his best to do you a mischief and then bring you up before the justice of the peace 
 but then you make complaints to the justice too said sviiazhsky 
 i lodge complaints not for anything in the world so much talk springs up that one is sorry ever to have complained at the works for instance they pocketed the advance money and made off what did the justice do why acquitted them nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder flog them in the good old style but for that be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away 
 obviously the landowner was chaffing sviiazhsky who far from resenting it was apparently amused by it 
 but you see we manage our land without such extreme measures said he smiling levin and i and this gentleman 
 he indicated the other landowner 
 yes the done at mikhail but ask him how done do you call that a rational system said the landowner obviously rather proud of the word rational 
 my very simple said mikhail petrovich thank god all my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes the peasants come to me father master help us well the peasants are all neighbors one feels for them so one advances them a third but one says remember lads i have helped you and you must help me when i need it whether the sowing of the oats or the hay cutting or the harvest and well one agrees so much for each taxpayer though there are dishonest ones among them too true 
 levin who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods exchanged glances with sviiazhsky and interrupted mikhail petrovich turning again to the gentleman with the gray mustaches 
 well what do you think he asked what system is one to adopt nowadays 
 why manage like mikhail petrovich or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants one can do that only just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined where the land with serf labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one on the metayage system it yields three to one russia has been ruined by the emancipation 
 sviiazhsky looked with smiling eyes at levin and even made a faint gesture of irony to him but levin did not think the words absurd he understood them better than he did sviiazhsky a great deal more of what the landowner said to show in what way russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true new to him and quite incontestable the landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual thought a thing that rarely happens and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village and had considered in every aspect 
 the point is you see that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority he said evidently wishing to show he was not without culture take the reforms of peter of catherine of alexander take european history and progress in agriculture more than anything else the potato for instance that was introduced among us by force the wooden plow too always used it was introduced in the days of appanaged princes perhaps but it was probably brought in by force now in our own day we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry drying machines and threshing machines and carting manure and all the modern implements all these we brought into use by our authority and the peasants opposed it at first and ended by imitating us now by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority and so our husbandry where it had been raised to a high level is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition how i see it 
 
 but why so if rational be able to keep up the same system with hired labor said sviiazhsky 
 no power over them with whom am i going to work the system allow me to ask 
 there it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture thought levin 
 with laborers 
 the laborers work well and work with good implements our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a swine and then ruin everything you give him he spoils the horses by watering unseasonably he cuts good harness barters the tires of the wheels for drink drops bits of iron into the threshing machine so as to break it he loathes the sight of anything not after his fashion and how the whole level of husbandry has fallen lands gone out of cultivation overgrown with weeds or divided among the peasants and where millions of chetverts were raised you get a hundred thousand the wealth of the country has decreased if the same thing had been done but with consideration for 
 and he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided 
 this did not interest levin but when he had finished levin went back to his first position and addressing sviiazhsky and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion said 
 perfectly true that the standard of culture is falling and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit said he 
 i believe it sviiazhsky replied quite seriously all i see is that we know how to cultivate the land and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high but too low we have no machines no good stock no efficient supervision we even know how to keep accounts ask any landowner he be able to tell you which profitable and which 
 italian bookkeeping said the landowner ironically you may keep your books as you like but if they spoil everything for you there be any profit 
 why do they spoil things a poor threshing machine or your russian presser they will break but my steam press they break a wretched russian nag ruin but keep good percherons or the russian wagon horses they ruin them and so it is all round we must raise our farming to a higher level 
 oh if one only had the means to do it nikolai ivanovich all very well for you but for me with a son to keep at the university lads to be educated at the high school how am i going to buy these percherons 
 well what the banks are for 
 to get whatever i have left sold by auction no thank you 
 i agree that necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher said levin i devote myself to it and i have means but i can do nothing as to the banks i know to whom any good for my part anyway whatever spent money on in the way of husbandry has been a loss stock a loss machinery a loss 
 true enough the gentleman with the gray mustaches chimed in even laughing with satisfaction 
 and not the only one pursued levin i mix with all the neighboring landowners who are cultivating their land on a rational system they all with rare exceptions are doing so at a loss come tell us how does your land do does it pay said levin and at once in eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind 
 moreover this question on part was not quite in good faith madame sviiazhsky had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a german expert accountant from moscow who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles she did not remember the precise sum but it appeared that the german had worked it out to the fraction of a kopeck 
 the landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of farming obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making 
 possibly it does not pay answered sviiazhsky that merely proves that either a bad manager or that sunk my capital for the increase of my rents 
 oh rent levin cried with horror rent there may be in europe where land has been improved by the labor put into it but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words working it out so no question of rent 
 how no rent a law 
 then outside the law rent explains nothing for us but simply muddles us no tell me how there can be a theory of rent 
 will you have some curded milk masha pass us some curded milk or raspberries he turned to his wife the raspberries are lasting extraordinarily late this year 
 and in the happiest frame of mind sviiazhsky got up and walked off apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to levin it seemed that it was only just beginning 
 having lost his antagonist levin continued the conversation with the landowner trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer but the landowner like all men who think independently and in isolation was slow in taking in any other thought and particularly partial to his own he stuck to it that the russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority and there is none one must have the stick and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years with lawyers and model prisons where the worthless stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air 
 what makes you think said levin trying to get back to the question that impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive 
 that never could be so with the russian people no authority answered the landowner 
 how can new conditions be found said sviiazhsky having eaten some curded milk and lighted a cigarette he came back to the discussion all possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied he said the relic of barbarism the primitive commune with a guarantee for all will disappear of itself serfdom has been abolished there remains nothing but free labor and its forms are fixed and ready made and must be adopted permanent hands day laborers farmers you get out of those forms 
 but europe is dissatisfied with these forms 
 dissatisfied and seeking new ones and will find them in all probability 
 just what i meant answered levin why we seek them for ourselves 
 because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways they are ready invented 
 but if they suit us if stupid said levin 
 and again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of sviiazhsky 
 oh yes bury the world under our caps found the secret europe was seeking for heard all that but excuse me do you know all been done in europe on the question of the organization of labor 
 no very little 
 that question is now absorbing the best minds in europe the movement and then all this enormous literature of the labor question the most liberal lassalle movement the mulhausen experiment a fact by now as probably aware 
 i have some idea of it but very vague 
 no you only say that no doubt you know all about it as well as i do no professor of sociology of course but it interested me and really if it interests you you ought to study it 
 but what conclusion have they come to 
 excuse me 
 the two neighbors had risen and sviiazhsky once more checking levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind went to see his guests out

 and he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided 
 this did not interest levin but when he had finished levin went back to his first position and addressing sviiazhsky and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion said 
 perfectly true that the standard of culture is falling and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit said he 
 i believe it sviiazhsky replied quite seriously all i see is that we know how to cultivate the land and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high but too low we have no machines no good stock no efficient supervision we even know how to keep accounts ask any landowner he be able to tell you which profitable and which 
 italian bookkeeping said the landowner ironically you may keep your books as you like but if they spoil everything for you there be any profit 
 why do they spoil things a poor threshing machine or your russian presser they will break but my steam press they break a wretched russian nag ruin but keep good percherons or the russian wagon horses they ruin them and so it is all round we must raise our farming to a higher level 
 oh if one only had the means to do it nikolai ivanovich all very well for you but for me with a son to keep at the university lads to be educated at the high school how am i going to buy these percherons 
 well what the banks are for 
 to get whatever i have left sold by auction no thank you 
 i agree that necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher said levin i devote myself to it and i have means but i can do nothing as to the banks i know to whom any good for my part anyway whatever spent money on in the way of husbandry has been a loss stock a loss machinery a loss 
 true enough the gentleman with the gray mustaches chimed in even laughing with satisfaction 
 and not the only one pursued levin i mix with all the neighboring landowners who are cultivating their land on a rational system they all with rare exceptions are doing so at a loss come tell us how does your land do does it pay said levin and at once in eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind 
 moreover this question on part was not quite in good faith madame sviiazhsky had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a german expert accountant from moscow who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles she did not remember the precise sum but it appeared that the german had worked it out to the fraction of a kopeck 
 the landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of farming obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making 
 possibly it does not pay answered sviiazhsky that merely proves that either a bad manager or that sunk my capital for the increase of my rents 
 oh rent levin cried with horror rent there may be in europe where land has been improved by the labor put into it but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words working it out so no question of rent 
 how no rent a law 
 then outside the law rent explains nothing for us but simply muddles us no tell me how there can be a theory of rent 
 will you have some curded milk masha pass us some curded milk or raspberries he turned to his wife the raspberries are lasting extraordinarily late this year 
 and in the happiest frame of mind sviiazhsky got up and walked off apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to levin it seemed that it was only just beginning 
 having lost his antagonist levin continued the conversation with the landowner trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer but the landowner like all men who think independently and in isolation was slow in taking in any other thought and particularly partial to his own he stuck to it that the russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority and there is none one must have the stick and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years with lawyers and model prisons where the worthless stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air 
 what makes you think said levin trying to get back to the question that impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive 
 that never could be so with the russian people no authority answered the landowner 
 how can new conditions be found said sviiazhsky having eaten some curded milk and lighted a cigarette he came back to the discussion all possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied he said the relic of barbarism the primitive commune with a guarantee for all will disappear of itself serfdom has been abolished there remains nothing but free labor and its forms are fixed and ready made and must be adopted permanent hands day laborers farmers you get out of those forms 
 but europe is dissatisfied with these forms 
 dissatisfied and seeking new ones and will find them in all probability 
 just what i meant answered levin why we seek them for ourselves 
 because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways they are ready invented 
 but if they suit us if stupid said levin 
 and again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of sviiazhsky 
 oh yes bury the world under our caps found the secret europe was seeking for heard all that but excuse me do you know all been done in europe on the question of the organization of labor 
 no very little 
 that question is now absorbing the best minds in europe the movement and then all this enormous literature of the labor question the most liberal lassalle movement the mulhausen experiment a fact by now as probably aware 
 i have some idea of it but very vague 
 no you only say that no doubt you know all about it as well as i do no professor of sociology of course but it interested me and really if it interests you you ought to study it 
 but what conclusion have they come to 
 excuse me 
 the two neighbors had risen and sviiazhsky once more checking levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind went to see his guests out

 if only the heart to throw up been set going such a lot of trouble wasted turn my back on the whole business sell out go off like nikolai ivanovich to hear la belle hlne said the landowner a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face 
 but you see you throw it up said nikolai ivanovich sviiazhsky so there must be something gained 
 the only gain is that i live in my own house neither bought nor hired besides one keeps hoping the people will learn sense though instead of that believe it or not there is such drunkenness such immorality they keep making partition of their bits of land there a horse or a cow the dying of hunger but just go and take him on as a laborer do his best to do you a mischief and then bring you up before the justice of the peace 
 but then you make complaints to the justice too said sviiazhsky 
 i lodge complaints not for anything in the world so much talk springs up that one is sorry ever to have complained at the works for instance they pocketed the advance money and made off what did the justice do why acquitted them nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder flog them in the good old style but for that be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away 
 obviously the landowner was chaffing sviiazhsky who far from resenting it was apparently amused by it 
 but you see we manage our land without such extreme measures said he smiling levin and i and this gentleman 
 he indicated the other landowner 
 yes the done at mikhail but ask him how done do you call that a rational system said the landowner obviously rather proud of the word rational 
 my very simple said mikhail petrovich thank god all my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes the peasants come to me father master help us well the peasants are all neighbors one feels for them so one advances them a third but one says remember lads i have helped you and you must help me when i need it whether the sowing of the oats or the hay cutting or the harvest and well one agrees so much for each taxpayer though there are dishonest ones among them too true 
 levin who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods exchanged glances with sviiazhsky and interrupted mikhail petrovich turning again to the gentleman with the gray mustaches 
 well what do you think he asked what system is one to adopt nowadays 
 why manage like mikhail petrovich or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants one can do that only just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined where the land with serf labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one on the metayage system it yields three to one russia has been ruined by the emancipation 
 sviiazhsky looked with smiling eyes at levin and even made a faint gesture of irony to him but levin did not think the words absurd he understood them better than he did sviiazhsky a great deal more of what the landowner said to show in what way russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true new to him and quite incontestable the landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual thought a thing that rarely happens and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village and had considered in every aspect 
 the point is you see that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority he said evidently wishing to show he was not without culture take the reforms of peter of catherine of alexander take european history and progress in agriculture more than anything else the potato for instance that was introduced among us by force the wooden plow too always used it was introduced in the days of appanaged princes perhaps but it was probably brought in by force now in our own day we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry drying machines and threshing machines and carting manure and all the modern implements all these we brought into use by our authority and the peasants opposed it at first and ended by imitating us now by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority and so our husbandry where it had been raised to a high level is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition how i see it 
 
 but why so if rational be able to keep up the same system with hired labor said sviiazhsky 
 no power over them with whom am i going to work the system allow me to ask 
 there it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture thought levin 
 with laborers 
 the laborers work well and work with good implements our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a swine and then ruin everything you give him he spoils the horses by watering unseasonably he cuts good harness barters the tires of the wheels for drink drops bits of iron into the threshing machine so as to break it he loathes the sight of anything not after his fashion and how the whole level of husbandry has fallen lands gone out of cultivation overgrown with weeds or divided among the peasants and where millions of chetverts were raised you get a hundred thousand the wealth of the country has decreased if the same thing had been done but with consideration for

 part three 
 chapter 
 
 levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case but the general condition of things in russia that the evolving of some relation of the laborers to the soil which they would work as with the peasant he had met halfway to the sviiazhskys was not a dream but a problem which must be solved and it seemed to him that the problem could be solved and that he ought to try to solve it 
 after saying good night to the ladies and promising to stay the whole of the next day so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting gap in the crown forest levin went before going to bed into his study to get the books on the labor question that sviiazhsky had offered him study was a huge room by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing table standing in the middle of the room and the other a round table covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages ranged like the rays of a star round a lamp on the writing table was a stand of drawers marked with gold labels and full of papers of various sorts 
 sviiazhsky took out the books and sat down in a rocking chair 
 what are you looking at there he said to levin who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews oh yes a very interesting article here said sviiazhsky pointing to the review levin was holding in his hand it appears he went on with eager interest that friedrich was not after all the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland it is proved 
 and with his characteristic clearness he summed up those new very important and interesting revelations although levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land he wondered as he heard sviiazhsky what is there inside of him and why why is he interested in the partition of poland when sviiazhsky had finished levin could not help asking well and what then but there was nothing to follow it was simply interesting that such and such had been proved but sviiazhsky did not explain and saw no need of explaining why it was interesting to him 
 yes but i was very much interested by your irritable neighbor said levin sighing a clever fellow and said a lot that was true 
 oh get along with you an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart like all of them said sviiazhsky 
 whose marshal you are 
 yes only i marshal them in the other direction said sviiazhsky laughing 
 tell you what interests me very much said levin right that our system that is to say of rational farming answer that the only thing that answers is the moneylender system like that or else the very simplest whose fault is it 
 our own of course besides not true that it answer it answers with vassilchikov 
 a factory 
 but i really know what it is you are surprised at the people are at such a low stage of material and moral development that obviously bound to oppose everything necessary to them in europe a rational system answers because the people are educated it follows that we must educate the people all 
 but how are we to educate the people 
 to educate the people three things are needed schools and schools and schools 
 but you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development what help are schools for that 
 do you know you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man you should try purgative medicine taken it worse try leeches tried them worse well then nothing left but to pray to god tried it worse just how it is with us i say political economy you say worse i say socialism worse education worse 
 but how do schools help matters 
 they give the peasant fresh wants 
 well a thing never understood levin replied with heat in what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position you say schools education will give them fresh wants so much the worse since they be capable of satisfying them and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition i never could make out the day before yesterday i met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby and asked her where she was going she said she was going to the wisewoman her boy had screaming fits so she was taking him to be doctored i asked why how does the wisewoman cure screaming fits she puts the child on the hen roost and repeats some charm 
 well saying it yourself wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen roost to cure it of screaming fits is just sviiazhsky said smiling 
 oh no said levin with annoyance that method of doctoring i merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools the people are poor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby has fits because it screams but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen roost affects the screaming what has to be cured is what makes him poor 
 well in that at least in agreement with spencer whom you dislike so much he says too that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort of more frequent washing as he says but not of being able to read and write 
 well then very glad or the contrary very sorry that in agreement with spencer only known it a long while schools can do no good what will do good is an economic organization in which the people will become richer will have more leisure and then there will be schools 
 still all over europe now schools are obligatory 
 and how far do you agree with spencer yourself about it asked levin 
 but there was a gleam of alarm in eyes and he said smiling

 yes i ought to have said to him you say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements and that they must be forced on him by authority if no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements you would be quite right but the only system that does answer is when the laborer is working in accordance with his habits just as on the old land halfway here your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers we have gone our way the european way a long while without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force but as the russian mouzhik with his instincts and let us arrange our system of agriculture in accordance with that imagine i ought to have said to him that you have the same system as the old peasant has that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit and you will without exhausting the soil get twice or three times the yield you got before divide it in halves give half as the share of labor the surplus left you will be greater and share will be greater too and to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success how to do this a matter of detail but undoubtedly it can be done

 levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case but the general condition of things in russia that the evolving of some relation of the laborers to the soil which they would work as with the peasant he had met halfway to the sviiazhskys was not a dream but a problem which must be solved and it seemed to him that the problem could be solved and that he ought to try to solve it 
 after saying good night to the ladies and promising to stay the whole of the next day so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting gap in the crown forest levin went before going to bed into his study to get the books on the labor question that sviiazhsky had offered him study was a huge room by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing table standing in the middle of the room and the other a round table covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages ranged like the rays of a star round a lamp on the writing table was a stand of drawers marked with gold labels and full of papers of various sorts 
 sviiazhsky took out the books and sat down in a rocking chair 
 what are you looking at there he said to levin who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews oh yes a very interesting article here said sviiazhsky pointing to the review levin was holding in his hand it appears he went on with eager interest that friedrich was not after all the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland it is proved 
 and with his characteristic clearness he summed up those new very important and interesting revelations although levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land he wondered as he heard sviiazhsky what is there inside of him and why why is he interested in the partition of poland when sviiazhsky had finished levin could not help asking well and what then but there was nothing to follow it was simply interesting that such and such had been proved but sviiazhsky did not explain and saw no need of explaining why it was interesting to him 
 yes but i was very much interested by your irritable neighbor said levin sighing a clever fellow and said a lot that was true 
 oh get along with you an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart like all of them said sviiazhsky 
 whose marshal you are 
 yes only i marshal them in the other direction said sviiazhsky laughing 
 tell you what interests me very much said levin right that our system that is to say of rational farming answer that the only thing that answers is the moneylender system like that or else the very simplest whose fault is it 
 our own of course besides not true that it answer it answers with vassilchikov 
 a factory 
 but i really know what it is you are surprised at the people are at such a low stage of material and moral development that obviously bound to oppose everything necessary to them in europe a rational system answers because the people are educated it follows that we must educate the people all 
 but how are we to educate the people 
 to educate the people three things are needed schools and schools and schools 
 but you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development what help are schools for that 
 do you know you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man you should try purgative medicine taken it worse try leeches tried them worse well then nothing left but to pray to god tried it worse just how it is with us i say political economy you say worse i say socialism worse education worse 
 but how do schools help matters 
 they give the peasant fresh wants 
 well a thing never understood levin replied with heat in what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position you say schools education will give them fresh wants so much the worse since they be capable of satisfying them and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition i never could make out the day before yesterday i met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby and asked her where she was going she said she was going to the wisewoman her boy had screaming fits so she was taking him to be doctored i asked why how does the wisewoman cure screaming fits she puts the child on the hen roost and repeats some charm 
 well saying it yourself wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen roost to cure it of screaming fits is just sviiazhsky said smiling 
 oh no said levin with annoyance that method of doctoring i merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools the people are poor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby has fits because it screams but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen roost affects the screaming what has to be cured is what makes him poor 
 well in that at least in agreement with spencer whom you dislike so much he says too that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort of more frequent washing as he says but not of being able to read and write 
 well then very glad or the contrary very sorry that in agreement with spencer only known it a long while schools can do no good what will do good is an economic organization in which the people will become richer will have more leisure and then there will be schools 
 still all over europe now schools are obligatory 
 and how far do you agree with spencer yourself about it asked levin 
 but there was a gleam of alarm in eyes and he said smiling 
 no that screaming story is positively capital did you really hear it yourself

 chapter 
 
 the carrying out of plan presented many difficulties but he struggled on doing his utmost and attained a result which though not what he desired was enough to enable him without to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble one of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning and the machine had to be mended while in motion 
 when on the evening of his arrival home he informed the bailiff of his plans the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless the bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago but no heed had been paid him but as for the proposal made by levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency and offered no definite opinion but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day and of sending the men out for the second plowing so that levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it 
 on beginning to talk to the peasants about it and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme 
 the simplehearted ivan the cowherd seemed to grasp proposal fully that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle yard and he was in complete sympathy with the plan but when levin hinted at the future advantages face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens or ran to get water or to clear out the manure 
 another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasants that a object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them they were firmly convinced that his real aim whatever he might say to them would always be in what he did not say to them and they themselves in giving their opinion said a great deal but never said what was their real object moreover levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatsoever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind nor to use new implements they agreed that the modern plow plowed better that the scarifier did the work more quickly but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation he felt sorry to give up improved methods the advantages of which were so obvious but in spite of all these difficulties he got his way and by autumn the system was working or at least so it seemed to him 
 at first levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants the laborers and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible and determined to divide it up the cattle yard the garden hayfields and arable land divided into several parts had to be made into separate lots the simplehearted cowherd ivan who levin fancied understood the matter better than any of them collecting together a gang of workers to help him principally of his own family became a partner in the cattle yard a distant part of the estate a tract of wasteland that had lain fallow for eight years was with the help of the clever carpenter fiodor rezunov taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership and the peasant shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms the remainder of the land was still worked on the old system but these three items were the first step to a new organization of the whole and they completely engrossed levin 
 it is true that in the cattle yard things went no better than before and ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream affirming that cows require less food if kept cold and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream and he asked for wages just as under the old system and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits 
 it is true that fiodor company did not plow over the ground twice before sowing as had been agreed justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short it is true that the peasants of the same company though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions always spoke of the land not as held in partnership but as rented for half the crop and more than once the peasants and rezunov himself said to levin if you would take a rent for the land it would save you trouble and we should be more free moreover the same peasants kept putting off on various excuses the building of a cattle yard and threshing barn on the land as agreed upon and delayed doing it till the winter 
 it is true that shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants he evidently quite misunderstood and apparently intentionally misunderstood the conditions upon which the land had been given to him

 the carrying out of plan presented many difficulties but he struggled on doing his utmost and attained a result which though not what he desired was enough to enable him without to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble one of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning and the machine had to be mended while in motion

 another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasants that a object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them they were firmly convinced that his real aim whatever he might say to them would always be in what he did not say to them and they themselves in giving their opinion said a great deal but never said what was their real object moreover levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatsoever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind nor to use new implements they agreed that the modern plow plowed better that the scarifier did the work more quickly but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation he felt sorry to give up improved methods the advantages of which were so obvious but in spite of all these difficulties he got his way and by autumn the system was working or at least so it seemed to him

 at the end of september the timber had been carted for building the cattle yard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided in practice the system worked capitally or at least so it seemed to levin in order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book which in daydreams was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil all that was left to do was to make a tour abroad and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same direction and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there was not what was wanted levin was only waiting for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad but the rains began preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in the fields and putting a stop to all work even to the delivery of the wheat the mud was impassable along the roads two mills were carried away by the spate and the weather got worse and worse 
 on the th of september the sun came out in the morning and hoping for fine weather levin began making final preparations for his journey he gave orders for the wheat to be delivered sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him and went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before setting off 
 having finished all his business soaked through with the streams of water which kept running into his leather coat and down his neck and his boot tops but in the keenest and most confident temper levin turned homeward in the evening the weather had become worse than ever toward evening the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went along sideways shaking her head and ears but levin was all right under his hood and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels at the drops hanging on every bare twig at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge at the thick layer of still succulent fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm tree in spite of the gloominess of nature around him he felt peculiarly eager the talks he had been having with the peasants in the farther village had shown that they were beginning to get used to their new position the innkeeper an old man to whose inn he had gone to get dry evidently approved of plan and of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership for purchasing of cattle 
 i have only to go on stubbornly toward my aim and i shall attain my end thought levin and something to work and take trouble for this is not a matter of myself individually the question of the public welfare comes into it the whole system of agriculture the chief element in the condition of the people must be completely transformed instead of poverty general prosperity and content instead of hostility harmony and unity of interests in short a bloodless revolution but a revolution of the greatest magnitude beginning in the little circle of our district then the province then russia and the whole world because a just idea cannot but be fruitful yes an aim worth working for and the fact that it is i kostia levin who went to a ball in a black tie and was refused by the shcherbatsky girl and who is intrinsically such a pitiful worthless creature to himself that proves nothing i feel sure franklin felt just as worthless and he too had no faith in himself thinking of himself as a whole that means nothing and he too most likely had an agathya mikhailovna to whom he confided his secrets 
 musing on such thoughts levin reached home in the darkness 
 the bailiff who had been to the merchant had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat an agreement had been made with the old innkeeper and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields so that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others 
 after dinner levin was sitting as he usually did in an easy chair with a book and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before him in connection with his book today all the significance of his book rose before him with special distinctness and whole periods ranged themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories i must write that down he thought that ought to form a brief introduction which i thought unnecessary before he got up to go to his writing table and laska lying at his feet got up too stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where to go but he had not time to write it down for the overseers had come for receiving orders and levin went out into the hall to meet them 
 after giving orders that is to say directions about the labors of the next day and seeing all the peasants who had business with him levin went back to his study and sat down to work laska lay under the table agathya mikhailovna settled herself in her place with her stocking 
 after writing for a little while levin suddenly thought with exceptional vividness of kitty her refusal and their last meeting he got up and began walking about the room 
 the use of being downhearted said agathya mikhailovna come why do you stay on at home you ought to go to some warm springs especially now that ready for the journey 
 well i am going away the day after tomorrow agathya mikhailovna i must finish my work 
 there there your work you say as if you done enough for the peasants why as tis saying your master will be getting some honor from the czar for it indeed tis a strange thing why need you worry about the peasants 
 not worrying about them doing it for my own good

 the bailiff who had been to the merchant had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat an agreement had been made with the old innkeeper and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields so that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others

 running halfway down the staircase levin caught a sound he knew a familiar cough in the hall but he heard it indistinctly through the sound of his own footsteps and hoped he was mistaken then he caught sight of a long bony familiar figure and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake and yet he still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother nikolai 
 levin loved his brother but being with him was always a torture just now when levin under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him and agathya hint was in a troubled and uncertain humor this meeting with his brother which he had to face seemed particularly difficult instead of a lively healthy visitor some outsider who would he hoped cheer him up in his uncertain humor he had to see his brother who knew him through and through who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart would force him to show himself fully and that he was not disposed to do 
 angry with himself for so base a feeling levin ran into the hall as soon as he had seen his brother close this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity terrible as his brother nikolai had been before in his emaciation and sickliness now he looked still more emaciated still more wasted he was a skeleton covered by skin 
 he stood in the hall jerking his long thin neck and pulling the scarf off it and smiled a strange and pitiful smile when he saw that smile submissive and humble levin felt something clutching at his throat 
 you see come to you said nikolai in a thick voice never for one second taking his eyes off his face been meaning to a long while but been constantly unwell now ever so much better he said rubbing his beard with his big thin hands 
 yes yes answered levin and he felt still more frightened when kissing him he felt with his lips the dryness of his skin and saw close to him his big eyes full of a strange light 
 a few weeks before konstantin levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property that had remained undivided there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share 
 nikolai said that he had come now to take his money and what was more important to stay a while in the old nest to get in touch with the earth so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him in spite of his exaggerated stoop and the emaciation that was so striking from his height his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever levin led him into his study 
 his brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to do combed his scanty lank hair and smiling went upstairs 
 he was in the most affectionate and mood just as levin often remembered him in childhood he even referred to sergei ivanovich without rancor when he saw agathya mikhailovna he joked with her and asked after the old servants the news of the death of parfion denissich made a painful impression on him a look of fear crossed his face but he regained his serenity immediately 
 of course he was quite old he said and changed the subject well spend a month or two with you and then off to moscow do you know miaghkov has promised me a place there and going into the service now going to arrange my life quite differently he went on you know i got rid of that woman 
 marya nikolaevna why what for 
 oh she was a horrid woman she caused me all sorts of annoyances but he did not say what the annoyances were he could not say that he had driven off marya nikolaevna because the tea was weak and above all because she would look after him as though he were an invalid besides i want to turn over a new leaf completely now done silly things of course like everyone else but the last consideration i regret it so long as health and my health thank god is quite restored 
 levin listened and racked his brains but could think of nothing to say nikolai probably felt the same he began questioning his brother about his affairs and levin was glad to talk about himself because then he could speak without hypocrisy he told his brother of his plans and his doings 
 his brother listened but evidently he was not interested 
 these two men were so akin so near each other that the slightest gesture the tone of voice told both more than could be said in words 
 both of them now had only one thought the illness of nikolai and the nearness of his death which stifled all else but neither of them dared speak of it and so whatever they said without uttering the one thought that filled their minds was all falsehood never had levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed never with any outside person never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening and the consciousness of this unnaturalness and the remorse he felt at it made him even more unnatural he wanted to weep over his dying dearly loved brother and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live 
 as the house was damp and only the one bedroom had been kept heated levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a partition 
 his brother got into bed and whether he slept or did not sleep tossed about like a sick man coughed and when he could not get his throat clear mumbled something sometimes when his breathing was painful he said oh my god sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily ah the devil levin could not sleep for a long while hearing him his thoughts were of the most various kinds but the end of all his thoughts was the same death 
 death the inevitable end of all for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force and death which was here in this loved brother groaning and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him it was in himself too that he felt this if not today tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirty years it all the same and what was this inevitable death he did not know had never thought about it and what was more had not the power had not the courage to think about it 
 i work i want to do something but i had forgotten it must all end i had forgotten death 
 he sat on his bed in the darkness crouched up hugging his knees and holding his breath from the strain of thought he pondered but the more intensely he thought the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so that in reality looking upon life he had forgotten one little fact that death will come and all ends that nothing was even worth beginning and that there was no helping it anyway yes it was awful but it was so 
 but i am alive still to be done now to be done he asked in despair he lighted a candle got up cautiously went to the looking glass and began looking at his face and hair yes there were gray hairs about his temples he opened his mouth his back teeth were beginning to decay he bared his muscular arms yes there was strength in them but nikolenka who lay there breathing with what was left of his lungs had had a strong healthy body too and suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children and how they only waited till fiodor bogdanich was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh laugh irrepressibly so that even their awe of fiodor bogdanich could not check the effervescing overbrimming sense of life and happiness and now that warped hollow chest and i not knowing what will become of me or wherefore 
 damnation why do you keep fidgeting why you go to sleep his voice called to him 
 oh i know not sleepy 
 i have had a good sleep not in a sweat now just see feel my shirt no sweat is there 
 levin felt it withdrew behind the partition and put out the candle but for a long while he could not sleep the question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him when a new insolvable question presented itself death 
 why dying yes die in the spring and how is one to help him what can i say to him what do i know about it even forgotten the very fact of it

 death the inevitable end of all for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force and death which was here in this loved brother groaning and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him it was in himself too that he felt this if not today tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirty years it all the same and what was this inevitable death he did not know had never thought about it and what was more had not the power had not the courage to think about it 
 i work i want to do something but i had forgotten it must all end i had forgotten death 
 he sat on his bed in the darkness crouched up hugging his knees and holding his breath from the strain of thought he pondered but the more intensely he thought the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so that in reality looking upon life he had forgotten one little fact that death will come and all ends that nothing was even worth beginning and that there was no helping it anyway yes it was awful but it was so 
 but i am alive still to be done now to be done he asked in despair he lighted a candle got up cautiously went to the looking glass and began looking at his face and hair yes there were gray hairs about his temples he opened his mouth his back teeth were beginning to decay he bared his muscular arms yes there was strength in them but nikolenka who lay there breathing with what was left of his lungs had had a strong healthy body too and suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children and how they only waited till fiodor bogdanich was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh laugh irrepressibly so that even their awe of fiodor bogdanich could not check the effervescing overbrimming sense of life and happiness and now that warped hollow chest and i not knowing what will become of me or wherefore 
 damnation why do you keep fidgeting why you go to sleep his voice called to him 
 oh i know not sleepy 
 i have had a good sleep not in a sweat now just see feel my shirt no sweat is there 
 levin felt it withdrew behind the partition and put out the candle but for a long while he could not sleep the question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him when a new insolvable question presented itself death 
 why dying yes die in the spring and how is one to help him what can i say to him what do i know about it even forgotten the very fact of it

 running halfway down the staircase levin caught a sound he knew a familiar cough in the hall but he heard it indistinctly through the sound of his own footsteps and hoped he was mistaken then he caught sight of a long bony familiar figure and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake and yet he still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother nikolai 
 levin loved his brother but being with him was always a torture just now when levin under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him and agathya hint was in a troubled and uncertain humor this meeting with his brother which he had to face seemed particularly difficult instead of a lively healthy visitor some outsider who would he hoped cheer him up in his uncertain humor he had to see his brother who knew him through and through who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart would force him to show himself fully and that he was not disposed to do 
 angry with himself for so base a feeling levin ran into the hall as soon as he had seen his brother close this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity terrible as his brother nikolai had been before in his emaciation and sickliness now he looked still more emaciated still more wasted he was a skeleton covered by skin 
 he stood in the hall jerking his long thin neck and pulling the scarf off it and smiled a strange and pitiful smile when he saw that smile submissive and humble levin felt something clutching at his throat 
 you see come to you said nikolai in a thick voice never for one second taking his eyes off his face been meaning to a long while but been constantly unwell now ever so much better he said rubbing his beard with his big thin hands 
 yes yes answered levin and he felt still more frightened when kissing him he felt with his lips the dryness of his skin and saw close to him his big eyes full of a strange light 
 a few weeks before konstantin levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property that had remained undivided there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share 
 nikolai said that he had come now to take his money and what was more important to stay a while in the old nest to get in touch with the earth so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him in spite of his exaggerated stoop and the emaciation that was so striking from his height his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever levin led him into his study 
 his brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to do combed his scanty lank hair and smiling went upstairs 
 he was in the most affectionate and mood just as levin often remembered him in childhood he even referred to sergei ivanovich without rancor when he saw agathya mikhailovna he joked with her and asked after the old servants the news of the death of parfion denissich made a painful impression on him a look of fear crossed his face but he regained his serenity immediately 
 of course he was quite old he said and changed the subject well spend a month or two with you and then off to moscow do you know miaghkov has promised me a place there and going into the service now going to arrange my life quite differently he went on you know i got rid of that woman 
 marya nikolaevna why what for 
 oh she was a horrid woman she caused me all sorts of annoyances but he did not say what the annoyances were he could not say that he had driven off marya nikolaevna because the tea was weak and above all because she would look after him as though he were an invalid besides i want to turn over a new leaf completely now done silly things of course like everyone else but the last consideration i regret it so long as health and my health thank god is quite restored 
 levin listened and racked his brains but could think of nothing to say nikolai probably felt the same he began questioning his brother about his affairs and levin was glad to talk about himself because then he could speak without hypocrisy he told his brother of his plans and his doings 
 his brother listened but evidently he was not interested 
 these two men were so akin so near each other that the slightest gesture the tone of voice told both more than could be said in words 
 both of them now had only one thought the illness of nikolai and the nearness of his death which stifled all else but neither of them dared speak of it and so whatever they said without uttering the one thought that filled their minds was all falsehood never had levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed never with any outside person never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening and the consciousness of this unnaturalness and the remorse he felt at it made him even more unnatural he wanted to weep over his dying dearly loved brother and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live 
 as the house was damp and only the one bedroom had been kept heated levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a partition 
 his brother got into bed and whether he slept or did not sleep tossed about like a sick man coughed and when he could not get his throat clear mumbled something sometimes when his breathing was painful he said oh my god sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily ah the devil levin could not sleep for a long while hearing him his thoughts were of the most various kinds but the end of all his thoughts was the same death

 levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their pretensions and irritability he felt that this was how it would be with his brother and his brother gentleness did not in fact last out for long the very next morning he began to be irritable and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother attacking him on his tenderest points 
 levin felt himself to blame and could not set things right he felt that if they had both not kept up appearances but had spoken as it is called from the heart that is to say had said only just what they were thinking and feeling they would simply have looked into each faces and konstantin could only have said dying dying and nikolai could only have answered i know dying but afraid afraid afraid and they could have said nothing more if they had said only what was in their hearts but life like that was impossible and so konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life and never could learn to do though as far as he could observe many people knew so well how to do it and without it there was no living at all he tried to say what he was not thinking but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood that his brother detected him in it and was exasperated at it 
 the third day nikolai induced his brother to explain his plan to him again and began not merely attacking it but intentionally confounding it with communism 
 simply borrowed an idea not your own but distorted it and are trying to apply it where not applicable 
 but i tell you nothing in common they deny the justice of property of capital of inheritance while i do not deny this chief stimulus levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions but ever since he had been engrossed by his work he had unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words all i want is to regulate labor 
 which means borrowed an idea stripped it of all that gave it its force and want to make believe that something new said nikolai angrily tugging at his necktie 
 but my idea has nothing in common 
 the other at any rate said nikolai levin with an ironical smile his eyes flashing malignantly has the charm of one to call it geometrical symmetry of clearness of definiteness it may be a utopia if one once allows the possibility of making all the past a tabula rasa no property no family then labor would organize itself but you have nothing 
 why do you mix things up never been a communist 
 but i have and i consider premature but rational and it has a future just like christianity in its first ages 
 all that i maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science that is to say it ought to be studied its qualities ascertained 
 but an utter waste of time that force finds a certain form of activity of itself according to the stage of its development there have been slaves first everywhere then metayers and we have the metayage system rent and day laborers what are you trying to find 
 levin suddenly lost his temper at these words because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms and that this was hardly possible 
 i am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers i want to organize he answered hotly 
 you want to organize anything simply the same as been all your life you want to be original to pose as not simply exploiting the peasants but with some idea in view 
 oh all right what you think and let me alone answered levin feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably 
 never had and never have convictions all you want is to please your vanity 
 oh very well let me alone then 
 and i will let you alone and high time i did and go to the devil with you and very sorry i ever came 
 in spite of all efforts to soothe his brother afterward nikolai would listen to nothing he said declaring that it was better to part and konstantin saw that it was simply a case of life being unbearable to him 
 nikolai was just getting ready to go when konstantin went in to him again and begged him rather unnaturally to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way 
 ah generosity said nikolai and he smiled if you want to be right i can give you that satisfaction in the right but going all the same 
 it was only just at parting that nikolai kissed him and said looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother 
 anyway remember evil against me kostia and his voice quavered 
 these were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them levin knew that those words meant you see and you know that in a bad way and maybe we shall never see each other again levin knew this and the tears gushed from his eyes he kissed his brother once more but he could not speak and knew not what to say 
 two days after his departure levin too set off for his foreign tour happening to meet shcherbatsky cousin in the railway train levin greatly astonished him by his depression 
 the matter with you shcherbatsky asked him 
 oh nothing not much happiness in life 
 not much you come with me to paris instead of to mulhouse you shall see how to be happy 
 no done with it all time i was dead 
 well a good one said shcherbatsky laughing why only just getting ready to begin 
 yes i thought the same not long ago but now i know i shall soon be dead 
 levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late he saw nothing but death or an approach to death in everything but his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more life had to be got through somehow till death did come darkness had fallen upon everything for him but just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work and he clutched it and clung to it with all his strength

 levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their pretensions and irritability he felt that this was how it would be with his brother and his brother gentleness did not in fact last out for long the very next morning he began to be irritable and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother attacking him on his tenderest points 
 levin felt himself to blame and could not set things right he felt that if they had both not kept up appearances but had spoken as it is called from the heart that is to say had said only just what they were thinking and feeling they would simply have looked into each faces and konstantin could only have said dying dying and nikolai could only have answered i know dying but afraid afraid afraid and they could have said nothing more if they had said only what was in their hearts but life like that was impossible and so konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life and never could learn to do though as far as he could observe many people knew so well how to do it and without it there was no living at all he tried to say what he was not thinking but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood that his brother detected him in it and was exasperated at it 
 the third day nikolai induced his brother to explain his plan to him again and began not merely attacking it but intentionally confounding it with communism 
 simply borrowed an idea not your own but distorted it and are trying to apply it where not applicable 
 but i tell you nothing in common they deny the justice of property of capital of inheritance while i do not deny this chief stimulus levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions but ever since he had been engrossed by his work he had unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words all i want is to regulate labor 
 which means borrowed an idea stripped it of all that gave it its force and want to make believe that something new said nikolai angrily tugging at his necktie 
 but my idea has nothing in common 
 the other at any rate said nikolai levin with an ironical smile his eyes flashing malignantly has the charm of one to call it geometrical symmetry of clearness of definiteness it may be a utopia if one once allows the possibility of making all the past a tabula rasa no property no family then labor would organize itself but you have nothing 
 why do you mix things up never been a communist 
 but i have and i consider premature but rational and it has a future just like christianity in its first ages 
 all that i maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science that is to say it ought to be studied its qualities ascertained 
 but an utter waste of time that force finds a certain form of activity of itself according to the stage of its development there have been slaves first everywhere then metayers and we have the metayage system rent and day laborers what are you trying to find 
 levin suddenly lost his temper at these words because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms and that this was hardly possible 
 i am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers i want to organize he answered hotly 
 you want to organize anything simply the same as been all your life you want to be original to pose as not simply exploiting the peasants but with some idea in view 
 oh all right what you think and let me alone answered levin feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably 
 never had and never have convictions all you want is to please your vanity 
 oh very well let me alone then 
 and i will let you alone and high time i did and go to the devil with you and very sorry i ever came 
 in spite of all efforts to soothe his brother afterward nikolai would listen to nothing he said declaring that it was better to part and konstantin saw that it was simply a case of life being unbearable to him 
 nikolai was just getting ready to go when konstantin went in to him again and begged him rather unnaturally to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way 
 ah generosity said nikolai and he smiled if you want to be right i can give you that satisfaction in the right but going all the same 
 it was only just at parting that nikolai kissed him and said looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother 
 anyway remember evil against me kostia and his voice quavered 
 these were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them levin knew that those words meant you see and you know that in a bad way and maybe we shall never see each other again levin knew this and the tears gushed from his eyes he kissed his brother once more but he could not speak and knew not what to say 
 two days after his departure levin too set off for his foreign tour happening to meet shcherbatsky cousin in the railway train levin greatly astonished him by his depression 
 the matter with you shcherbatsky asked him 
 oh nothing not much happiness in life 
 not much you come with me to paris instead of to mulhouse you shall see how to be happy 
 no done with it all time i was dead 
 well a good one said shcherbatsky laughing why only just getting ready to begin 
 yes i thought the same not long ago but now i know i shall soon be dead 
 levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late he saw nothing but death or an approach to death in everything but his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more life had to be got through somehow till death did come darkness had fallen upon everything for him but just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work and he clutched it and clung to it with all his strength

 chapter ii 
 
 the street urchin an enemy of light 
 how long did he remain thus 
 what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation 
 did he straighten up 
 did he remain bowed had he been bent to breaking 
 could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid 
 he probably would not have been able to tell himself 
 the street was deserted 
 a few uneasy bourgeois who were rapidly returning home hardly saw him 
 each one for himself in times of peril 
 the came as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door of no and then went away 
 jean valjean would not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined him in that shadow he sat there on the post of his door motionless as a form of ice there is congealment in despair 
 the alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible 
 in the midst of all these convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt the clock of struck eleven gravely and without haste for the tocsin is man the hour is god 
 the passage of the hour produced no effect on jean valjean jean valjean did not stir 
 still at about that moment a brusque report burst forth in the direction of the halles a second yet more violent followed it was probably that attack on the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by marius 
 at this double discharge whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night jean valjean started he rose turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded then he fell back upon the post again folded his arms and his head slowly sank on his bosom again 
 he resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself 
 all at once he raised his eyes some one was walking in the street he heard steps near him 
 he looked and by the light of the lanterns in the direction of the street which ran into the he perceived a young livid and beaming face 
 gavroche had just arrived in the rue arme 
 gavroche was staring into the air apparently in search of something he saw jean valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him 
 gavroche after staring into the air stared below he raised himself on tiptoe and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor they were all shut bolted and padlocked 
 after having authenticated the fronts of five or six barricaded houses in this manner the urchin shrugged his shoulders and took himself to task in these terms 
 pardi 
 then he began to stare into the air again 
 jean valjean who an instant previously in his then state of mind would not have spoken to or even answered any one felt irresistibly impelled to accost that child 
 what is the matter with you my little fellow he said 
 the matter with me is that i am hungry replied gavroche frankly and he added 
 little fellow yourself 
 jean valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a piece 
 but gavroche who was of the wagtail species and who skipped vivaciously from one gesture to another had just picked up a stone he had caught sight of the lantern 
 see here said he you still have your lanterns here you are disobeying the regulations my friend 
 this is disorderly smash that for me 
 and he flung the stone at the lantern whose broken glass fell with such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the opposite house cried 
 there is come again 
 the lantern oscillated violently and went out 
 the street had suddenly become black 
 right old street ejaculated gavroche put on your 
 and turning to jean valjean 
 what do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end of the street 
 the archives it 
 i must crumble up those big stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them 
 jean valjean stepped up to gavroche 
 poor creature he said in a low tone and speaking to himself he is hungry 
 and he laid the piece in his hand 
 gavroche raised his face astonished at the size of this sou he stared at it in the darkness and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him 
 he knew pieces by hearsay their reputation was agreeable to him he was delighted to see one close to he said 
 let us contemplate the tiger 
 he gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy then turning to jean valjean he held out the coin to him and said majestically to him 
 bourgeois i prefer to smash lanterns 
 take back your ferocious beast you bribe me 
 that has got five claws but it scratch me 
 have you a mother asked jean valjean 
 gavroche replied 
 more than you have perhaps 
 well returned jean valjean keep the money for your mother 
 gavroche was touched 
 moreover he had just noticed that the man who was addressing him had no hat and this inspired him with confidence 
 truly said he so it to keep me from breaking the lanterns 
 break whatever you please 
 a fine man said gavroche 
 and he put the piece into one of his pockets 
 his confidence having increased he added 
 do you belong in this street 
 yes why 
 can you tell me where no is 
 what do you want with no 
 here the child paused he feared that he had said too much he thrust his nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with replying 
 ah 
 here it is 
 an idea flashed through jean mind 
 anguish does have these gleams 
 he said to the lad 
 are you the person who is bringing a letter that i am expecting 
 you said gavroche 
 you are not a woman 
 the letter is for mademoiselle cosette is it not 
 cosette muttered gavroche 
 yes i believe that is the queer name 
 well resumed jean valjean i am the person to whom you are to deliver the letter 
 give it here 
 in that case you must know that i was sent from the barricade 
 of course said jean valjean 
 gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paper folded in four 
 then he made the military salute 
 respect for despatches said he 
 it comes from the provisional government 
 give it to me said jean valjean 
 gavroche held the paper elevated above his head 
 go and fancy a love letter 
 it is for a woman but for the people 
 we men fight and we respect the fair sex we are not as they are in fine society where there are lions who send chickens to camels 
 love letters 
 give it to me 
 after all continued gavroche you have the air of an honest man 
 give it to me quick 
 catch hold of it 
 and he handed the paper to jean valjean 
 and make haste monsieur for mamselle cosette is waiting 
 gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark 
 jean valjean began again 
 is it to that the answer is to be sent 
 there you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called brioches blunders this letter comes from the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie and going back there 
 good evening citizen 
 that said gavroche took himself off or to describe it more exactly fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird 
 he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it with the rigid rapidity of a projectile the alley of arme became silent and solitary once more in a twinkling that strange child who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses and was lost there like smoke in the dark and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished had there not taken place a few minutes after his disappearance a startling shiver of glass and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois 
 it was gavroche upon his way through the rue du chaume

 chapter ii 
 
 one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character in such actions instead of two crowds opposing each other the men disperse attack singly run away when attacked by stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was done by the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in the caucasus and by the russians in 
 people have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible that rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict 
 guerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringes that rule 
 this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers military science says that the more troops the greater the strength les gros bataillons ont toujours raison 
 large battalions are always victorious 
 for military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal 
 momentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocity 
 in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x 
 military science seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a geometric formation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in the genius of the commanders but the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts 
 yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify the heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders in order to find this unknown quantity 
 that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army quite independently of whether they are or are not fighting under the command of a genius in two or formation with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting 
 the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force to define and express the significance of this unknown factor the spirit of an army is a problem for science 
 this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent such as the commands of the general the equipment employed and so on mistaking these for the real significance of the factor and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only then expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor can we hope to define the unknown 
 ten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions or divisions conquer that is kill or take captive all the others while themselves losing four so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen and therefore x y consequently this equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battles campaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered 
 the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking and in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under fire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed than is needed to resist attacks but this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national wars 
 the french retreating in though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together the russians on the contrary ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up into small units because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers

 chapter iii 
 
 while cosette and toussaint are asleep 
 jean valjean went into the house with marius letter 
 he groped his way up the stairs as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey opened and shut his door softly listened to see whether he could hear any sure that to all appearances cosette and toussaint were asleep and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark so greatly did his hand tremble what he had just done smacked of theft 
 at last the candle was lighted he leaned his elbows on the table unfolded the paper and read 
 in violent emotions one does not read one flings to the earth so to speak the paper which one holds one clutches it like a victim one crushes it one digs into it the nails of wrath or of joy one hastens to the end one leaps to the beginning attention is at fever heat it takes up in the gross as it were the essential points it seizes on one point and the rest disappears in marius note to cosette jean valjean saw only these words 
 i die 
 when thou readest this my soul will be near thee 
 in the presence of these two lines he was horribly dazzled he remained for a moment crushed as it were by the change of emotion which was taking place within him he stared at marius note with a sort of intoxicated amazement he had before his eyes that splendor the death of a hated individual 
 he uttered a frightful cry of inward joy 
 so it was all over the catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope the being who obstructed his destiny was disappearing 
 that man had taken himself off of his own accord freely willingly 
 this man was going to his death and he jean valjean had had no hand in the matter and it was through no fault of his 
 perhaps even he is already dead 
 here his fever entered into calculations no he is not dead yet 
 the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning after the two discharges that were heard between eleven and midnight nothing more has taken place the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost he is caught in the gearing 
 jean valjean felt himself delivered so he was about to find himself alone with cosette once more the rivalry would cease the future was beginning again 
 he had but to keep this note in his pocket 
 cosette would never know what had become of that man 
 all that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course 
 this man cannot escape if he is not already dead it is certain that he is about to die what good fortune 
 having said all this to himself he became gloomy 
 then he went down stairs and woke up the porter 
 about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard and with his arms 
 the porter had easily found in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment he had a loaded gun and a filled with cartridges 
 he strode off in the direction of the markets

 the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning after the two discharges that were heard between eleven and midnight nothing more has taken place the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost he is caught in the gearing 
 jean valjean felt himself delivered so he was about to find himself alone with cosette once more the rivalry would cease the future was beginning again 
 he had but to keep this note in his pocket 
 cosette would never know what had become of that man 
 all that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course 
 this man cannot escape if he is not already dead it is certain that he is about to die what good fortune 
 having said all this to himself he became gloomy 
 then he went down stairs and woke up the porter 
 about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard and with his arms 
 the porter had easily found in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment he had a loaded gun and a filled with cartridges 
 he strode off in the direction of the markets

 no bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on reading these documents and he wrote to the german that despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish general to the polish general he replied to the same effect informing him that he was already under the command of the german 
 having arranged matters thus denisov and dolokhov intended without reporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces on october it was moving from the village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the road between mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it through these forests denisov and his party rode all day sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge but never losing sight of the moving french that morning cossacks of party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud not far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road since then and until evening the party had the movements of the french without attacking it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then after joining dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a hut in the forest less than a mile from shamshevo to surprise the french at dawn falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides and rout and capture them all at one blow 
 in their rear more than a mile from mikulino where the forest came right up to the road six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves 
 beyond shamshevo dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way to find out at what distance there were other french troops they reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men denisov had two hundred and dolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did not deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that is a man from the enemy column that attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a little drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column 
 denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert so he sent tikhon shcherbaty a peasant of his party to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance

 excess of zeal 
 in the meantime gavroche had had an adventure 
 gavroche after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the rue du chaume entered the rue des and not seeing even a cat there he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the song of which he was capable 
 his march far from being retarded by his singing was accelerated by it 
 he began to sow along the sleeping or terrified houses these incendiary couplets

 gavroche as he sang was lavish of his pantomime 
 gesture is the strong point of the refrain 
 his face an inexhaustible repertory of masks produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale 
 unfortunately as he was alone and as it was night this was neither seen nor even visible such wastes of riches do occur 
 all at once he stopped short 
 let us interrupt the romance said he 
 his feline eye had just descried in the recess of a carriage door what is called in painting an ensemble that is to say a person and a thing the thing was a the person was a man from auvergene who was sleeping therein 
 the shafts of the cart rested on the pavement and the head was supported against the front of the cart 
 his body was coiled up on this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground 
 gavroche with his experience of the things of this world recognized a drunken man 
 he was some corner who had drunk too much and was sleeping too much 
 there now thought gavroche what the summer nights are good for 
 take the cart for the republic and leave the auvergnat for the monarchy 
 his mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light 
 how bully that cart would look on our barricade 
 the auvergnat was snoring 
 gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind and at the auvergnat from the front that is to say by the feet and at the expiration of another minute the imperturbable auvergnat was reposing flat on the pavement 
 the cart was free 
 gavroche habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters had everything about him 
 he fumbled in one of his pockets and pulled from it a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter 
 he wrote 
 french republic 
 received thy cart 
 and he signed it 
 gavroche 
 that done he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring velvet vest seized the cart shafts in both hands and set off in the direction of the halles pushing the cart before him at a hard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar 
 this was perilous 
 there was a post at the royal printing establishment gavroche did not think of this 
 this post was occupied by the national guards of the suburbs 
 the squad began to wake up and heads were raised from camp beds 
 two street lanterns broken in succession that ditty sung at the top of the lungs this was a great deal for those cowardly streets which desire to go to sleep at sunset and which put the extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour 
 for the last hour that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement the uproar of a fly in a bottle 
 the sergeant of the banlieue lent an ear he waited 
 he was a prudent man 
 the mad rattle of the cart filled to overflowing the possible measure of waiting and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance 
 a whole band of them there said he let us proceed gently 
 it was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that it was stalking abroad through the quarter 
 and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread 
 all at once gavroche pushing his cart in front of him and at the very moment when he was about to turn into the rue des found himself face to face with a uniform a shako a plume and a gun 
 for the second time he stopped short 
 hullo said he him 
 good day public order 
 amazement was always brief and speedily thawed 
 where are you going you rascal shouted the sergeant 
 citizen retorted gavroche i called you bourgeois yet why do you insult me 
 where are you going you rogue 
 monsieur retorted gavroche perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday but you have degenerated this morning 
 i ask you where are you going you villain 
 gavroche replied 
 you speak prettily 
 really no one would suppose you as old as you are 
 you ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece that would yield you five hundred francs 
 where are you going 
 where are you going 
 where are you going bandit 
 gavroche retorted again 
 what villainous words 
 you must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give you suck 
 the sergeant lowered his bayonet 
 will you tell me where you are going you wretch 
 general said gavroche on my way to look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor 
 to arms shouted the sergeant 
 the of strong men consists in saving themselves by the very means that have ruined them gavroche took in the whole situation at a glance 
 it was the cart which had told against him it was the place to protect him 
 at the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent on gavroche the cart converted into a projectile and launched with all the might rolled down upon him furiously and the sergeant struck full in the stomach tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air 
 the men of the post had rushed out at the shout the shot brought on a general random discharge after which they reloaded their weapons and began again 
 this musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed several panes of glass 
 in the meanwhile gavroche who had retraced his steps at full speed halted five or six streets distant and seated himself panting on the stone post which forms the corner of the 
 he listened 
 after panting for a few minutes he turned in the direction where the fusillade was raging lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust it forward three times as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand an imperious gesture in which parisian has condensed french irony and which is evidently efficacious since it has already lasted half a century 
 this gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection 
 yes said he splitting with laughter twisting with delight i abound in joy but losing my way i shall have to take a roundabout way 
 if i only reach the barricade in season 
 thereupon he set out again on a run 
 and as he ran 
 ah by the way where was i said he 
 and he resumed his ditty as he plunged rapidly through the streets and this is what died away in the gloom

 book fourteen 
 chapter iv 
 
 it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down 
 denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse which turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thick black beard looked angry 
 beside denisov rode an esaul fellow worker also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse 
 a captain of cossacks 
 esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow with narrow light eyes and with calm in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength 
 a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap 
 a little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat 
 beside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to the hussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise this was the french drummer boy captured that morning 
 behind them along the narrow sodden cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours and then cossacks some in felt cloaks some in french greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or bay their necks with their wet manes looked strangely thin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins were all wet slippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at the back of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts 
 horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his knee against a tree 
 oh the devil exclaimed denisov angrily and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip splashing himself and his comrades with mud 
 denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger none of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because he still had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture a tongue had not returned 
 hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses thought denisov continually peering forward hoping to see a messenger from dolokhov 
 on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right denisov stopped 
 someone coming said he 
 the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated 
 there are two an officer and a cossack but it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was fond of using words the cossacks did not know 
 the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible but they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a weary gallop and using his leather whip rode an officer disheveled and drenched whose trousers had worked up to above his knees behind him standing in the stirrups trotted a cossack the officer a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes galloped up to denisov and handed him a sodden envelope 
 from the general said the officer please excuse its not being quite dry 
 denisov frowning took the envelope and opened it 
 there they kept telling us dangerous dangerous said the officer addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the dispatch but komarov and i he pointed to the cossack were prepared we have each of us two pistols but this he asked noticing the french drummer boy a prisoner already been in action may i speak to him 
 wostov petya exclaimed denisov having run through the dispatch why you say who you were and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad 
 the officer was petya rostov 
 all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer without hinting at their previous acquaintance but as soon as denisov smiled at him petya brightened up blushed with pleasure forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing and began telling him how he had already been in a battle near vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there 
 well i am glad to see you denisov interrupted him and his face again assumed its anxious expression 
 michael feoklitych said he to the esaul this is again fwom that german you know he he indicated petya is serving under him 
 and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the german demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport 
 if we take it tomowwow snatch it fwom under our noses he added 
 while denisov was talking to the esaul petya abashed by cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice it while maintaining as martial an air as possible 
 will there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself or shall i remain with your honor 
 orders denisov repeated thoughtfully but can you stay till tomowwow 
 oh please may i stay with you cried petya 
 but just what did the genewal tell you to weturn at once asked denisov 
 petya blushed 
 he gave me no instructions i think i could he returned inquiringly 
 well all wight said denisov 
 and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the hut in the forest and told the officer on the kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go and find out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening denisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to shamshevo to have a look at the part of the french bivouac they were to attack next day 
 well old fellow said he to the peasant guide lead us to shamshevo 
 denisov petya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest

 book fourteen 
 chapter iv 
 
 it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down 
 denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse which turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thick black beard looked angry 
 beside denisov rode an esaul fellow worker also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse 
 a captain of cossacks 
 esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow with narrow light eyes and with calm in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength 
 a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap 
 a little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat

 book war between four walls 
 chapter i 
 
 the charybdis of the faubourg saint antoine and the scylla of the faubourg du temple 
 the two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies can name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work is laid 
 these two barricades both of them symbols under two different aspects of a redoubtable situation sprang from the earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of june the greatest war of the streets that history has ever beheld 
 it sometimes happens that even contrary to principles even contrary to liberty equality and fraternity even contrary to the universal vote even contrary to the government by all for all from the depths of its anguish of its discouragements and its destitutions of its fevers of its distresses of its miasmas of its ignorances of its darkness that great and despairing body the rabble protests against and that the populace wages battle against the people 
 beggars attack the common right the ochlocracy rises against demos 
 these are melancholy days for there is always a certain amount of night even in this madness there is suicide in this duel and those words which are intended to be insults beggars canaille ochlocracy alas rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited 
 for our own part we never pronounce those words without pain and without respect for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries athens was an ochlocracy the beggars were the making of holland the populace saved rome more than once and the rabble followed jesus christ 
 there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences of the lower classes 
 it was of this rabble that saint jerome was thinking no doubt and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs when he uttered this mysterious saying 
 fex urbis lex orbis the dregs of the city the law of the earth 
 the exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds its violences contrary to all sense directed against the principles which are its life its masterful deeds against the right are its popular coups and should be repressed 
 the man of probity sacrifices himself and out of his very love for this crowd he combats it 
 but how excusable he feels it even while holding out against it 
 how he venerates it even while resisting it this is one of those rare moments when while doing that which it is duty to do one feels something which disconcerts one and which would dissuade one from proceeding further one persists it is necessary but conscience though satisfied is sad and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart 
 june let us hasten to say was an exceptional fact and almost impossible of classification in the philosophy of history all the words which we have just uttered must be discarded when it becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt in which one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights 
 it was necessary to combat it and this was a duty for it attacked the republic but what was june at bottom 
 a revolt of the people against itself 
 where the subject is not lost sight of there is no digression may we then be permitted to arrest the attention for a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which characterized this insurrection 
 one blocked the entrance to the faubourg saint antoine the other defended the approach to the faubourg du temple those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of june will never forget them 
 the barricade was tremendous it was three stories high and seven hundred feet wide 
 it barred the vast opening of the faubourg that is to say three streets from angle to angle ravined jagged cut up divided crenelated with an immense rent buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which had seen the th of july nineteen barricades were ranged one behind the other in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade 
 at the very sight of it one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe 
 of what was that barricade made 
 of the ruins of three houses demolished expressly said some of the prodigy of all wraths said others 
 it wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred ruin 
 it might be asked who built this 
 it might also be said 
 who destroyed this it was the improvisation of the ebullition 
 hold take this door this grating this penthouse this this broken brazier this cracked pot 
 give all cast away all push this roll dig dismantle overturn ruin everything it was the collaboration of the pavement the block of stone the beam the bar of iron the rag the scrap the broken pane the unseated chair the the tatter the rag and the malediction 
 it was grand and it was petty 
 it was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub 
 the mass beside the atom the strip of ruined wall and the broken fraternization of every sort of rubbish 
 sisyphus had thrown his rock there and job his potsherd 
 terrible in short 
 it was the acropolis of the barefooted 
 overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope an immense dray was spread out there crossways its axle pointing heavenward and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade an omnibus hoisted gayly by main force to the very summit of the heap as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror presented its horseless unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air 
 this gigantic heap the alluvium of the revolt figured to the mind an ossa on pelion of all revolutions on the th of thermidor on the th of august the th of brumaire on the th of january vendemiaire on prairial on the situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the bastille had disappeared if the ocean made dikes it is thus that it would build the fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass what flood 
 the crowd 
 one thought one beheld hubbub petrified one thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had been over their hive enormous dark bees of violent progress was it a thicket 
 was it a bacchanalia 
 was it a fortress vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings there was something of the in that redoubt and something olympian in that confusion 
 one there beheld in a full of despair the rafters of roofs bits of garret windows with their figured paper window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon wrecks of chimneys cupboards tables benches howling topsyturveydom and those thousand things the very refuse of the mendicant which contain at the same time fury and nothingness 
 one would have said that it was the tatters of a people rags of wood of iron of bronze of stone and that the faubourg saint antoine had thrust it there at its door with a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade 
 blocks resembling blocks dislocated chains pieces of woodwork with brackets having the form of gibbets horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people 
 the barricade saint antoine converted everything into a weapon everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence it was not combat it was a paroxysm the carbines which defended this redoubt among which there were some blunderbusses sent bits of earthenware bones even the casters from dangerous projectiles on account of the brass 
 this barricade was furious it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor at certain moments when provoking the army it was covered with throngs and tempest a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it a swarm filled it it had a thorny crest of guns of sabres of cudgels of axes of pikes and of bayonets a vast red flag flapped in the wind shouts of command songs of attack the roll of drums the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there 
 it was huge and living and like the back of an electric beast there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning the spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of god a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish it was a heap of filth and it was sinai 
 as we have said previously it attacked in the name of the 
 the revolution 
 barricade chance hazard disorder terror misunderstanding the unknown had facing it the constituent assembly the sovereignty of the people universal suffrage the nation the republic and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to the marseillaise 
 immense but heroic defiance for the old faubourg is a hero 
 the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance 
 the faubourg shouldered the redoubt the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg 
 the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the african generals dashed itself 
 its caverns its excrescences its warts its gibbosities grimaced so to speak and grinned beneath the smoke 
 the mitraille vanished in shapelessness the bombs plunged into it bullets only succeeded in making holes in it what was the use of cannonading chaos and the regiments accustomed to the fiercest visions of war gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of redoubt a wild beast in its bristling and a mountain by its enormous size 
 a quarter of a league away from the corner of the rue du temple which debouches on the boulevard near the if one thrust head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the dallemagne shop one perceived in the distance beyond the canal in the street which mounts the slopes of belleville at the culminating point of the rise a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly this wall was built of it was straight correct cold perpendicular levelled with the square laid out by rule and line cement was lacking of course but as in the case of certain roman walls without interfering with its rigid architecture the entablature was mathematically parallel with the base from distance to distance one could distinguish on the gray surface almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads these loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces the street was deserted as far as the eye could reach 
 all windows and doors were closed 
 in the background rose this barrier which made a blind thoroughfare of the street a motionless and tranquil wall no one was visible nothing was audible not a cry not a sound not a breath 
 a sepulchre 
 the dazzling sun of june inundated this terrible thing with light 
 it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple 
 as soon as one arrived on the spot and caught sight of it it was impossible even for the boldest not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition 
 it was adjusted jointed imbricated rectilinear symmetrical and funereal 
 science and gloom met there 
 one felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre 
 one looked at it and spoke low 
 from time to time if some soldier an officer or representative of the people chanced to traverse the deserted highway a faint sharp whistle was heard and the fell dead or wounded or if he escaped the bullet sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter in the interstice between two blocks of stone or in the plaster of a wall 
 for the men in the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two lengths of plugged up at one end with tow and there was no waste of useless powder 
 nearly every shot told there were corpses here and there and pools of blood on the pavement i remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street summer does not abdicate 
 in the neighborhood the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were encumbered with wounded 
 one felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street 
 massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at the entrance to the faubourg du temple the soldiers of the attacking column gravely and thoughtfully watched this dismal redoubt this immobility this passivity whence sprang death some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge taking care that their shakos did not project beyond it 
 the valiant colonel monteynard admired this barricade with a that is built he said to a representative not one projects beyond its neighbor 
 it is made of that moment a bullet broke the cross on his breast and he fell 
 the cowards people said 
 let them show themselves 
 let us see them 
 they dare not 
 they are hiding 
 the barricade of the faubourg du temple defended by eighty men attacked by ten thousand held out for three days 
 on the fourth they did as at zaatcha as at constantine they pierced the houses they came over the roofs the barricade was taken 
 not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight all were killed there with the exception of the leader barthelemy of whom we shall speak presently 
 the barricade was the tumult of thunders the barricade of the temple was silence 
 the difference between these two redoubts was the difference between the formidable and the sinister one seemed a maw the other a mask 
 admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed of a wrath and of an enigma one divined in the first barricade the dragon and behind the second the sphinx 
 these two fortresses had been erected by two men named the one cournet the other barthelemy 
 cournet made the barricade barthelemy the barricade of the temple each was the image of the man who had built it 
 cournet was a man of lofty stature he had broad shoulders a red face a crushing fist a bold heart a loyal soul a sincere and terrible eye intrepid energetic irascible stormy the most cordial of men the most formidable of combatants 
 war strife conflict were the very air he breathed and put him in a good humor 
 he had been an officer in the navy and from his gestures and his voice one divined that he sprang from the ocean and that he came from the tempest he carried the hurricane on into battle 
 with the exception of the genius there was in cournet something of danton as with the exception of the divinity there was in danton something of hercules 
 barthelemy thin feeble pale taciturn was a sort of tragic street urchin who having had his ears boxed by a policeman lay in wait for him and killed him and at seventeen was sent to the galleys 
 he came out and made this barricade 
 later on fatal circumstance in london proscribed by all barthelemy slew cournet 
 it was a funereal duel 
 some time afterwards caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part a catastrophe in which french justice sees extenuating circumstances and in which english justice sees only death barthelemy was hanged 
 the sombre social construction is so made that thanks to material destitution thanks to moral obscurity that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence certainly firm possibly great began in france with the galleys and ended in england with the gallows 
 barthelemy on occasion flew but one flag the black flag

 this barricade was furious it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor at certain moments when provoking the army it was covered with throngs and tempest a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it a swarm filled it it had a thorny crest of guns of sabres of cudgels of axes of pikes and of bayonets a vast red flag flapped in the wind shouts of command songs of attack the roll of drums the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there 
 it was huge and living and like the back of an electric beast there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning the spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of god a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish it was a heap of filth and it was sinai 
 as we have said previously it attacked in the name of the 
 the revolution 
 barricade chance hazard disorder terror misunderstanding the unknown had facing it the constituent assembly the sovereignty of the people universal suffrage the nation the republic and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to the marseillaise 
 immense but heroic defiance for the old faubourg is a hero 
 the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance 
 the faubourg shouldered the redoubt the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg 
 the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the african generals dashed itself 
 its caverns its excrescences its warts its gibbosities grimaced so to speak and grinned beneath the smoke 
 the mitraille vanished in shapelessness the bombs plunged into it bullets only succeeded in making holes in it what was the use of cannonading chaos and the regiments accustomed to the fiercest visions of war gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of redoubt a wild beast in its bristling and a mountain by its enormous size 
 a quarter of a league away from the corner of the rue du temple which debouches on the boulevard near the if one thrust head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the dallemagne shop one perceived in the distance beyond the canal in the street which mounts the slopes of belleville at the culminating point of the rise a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly this wall was built of it was straight correct cold perpendicular levelled with the square laid out by rule and line cement was lacking of course but as in the case of certain roman walls without interfering with its rigid architecture the entablature was mathematically parallel with the base from distance to distance one could distinguish on the gray surface almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads these loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces the street was deserted as far as the eye could reach 
 all windows and doors were closed 
 in the background rose this barrier which made a blind thoroughfare of the street a motionless and tranquil wall no one was visible nothing was audible not a cry not a sound not a breath 
 a sepulchre 
 the dazzling sun of june inundated this terrible thing with light 
 it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple 
 as soon as one arrived on the spot and caught sight of it it was impossible even for the boldest not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition 
 it was adjusted jointed imbricated rectilinear symmetrical and funereal 
 science and gloom met there 
 one felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre 
 one looked at it and spoke low 
 from time to time if some soldier an officer or representative of the people chanced to traverse the deserted highway a faint sharp whistle was heard and the fell dead or wounded or if he escaped the bullet sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter in the interstice between two blocks of stone or in the plaster of a wall 
 for the men in the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two lengths of plugged up at one end with tow and there was no waste of useless powder 
 nearly every shot told there were corpses here and there and pools of blood on the pavement i remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street summer does not abdicate 
 in the neighborhood the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were encumbered with wounded 
 one felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street 
 massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at the entrance to the faubourg du temple the soldiers of the attacking column gravely and thoughtfully watched this dismal redoubt this immobility this passivity whence sprang death some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge taking care that their shakos did not project beyond it 
 the valiant colonel monteynard admired this barricade with a that is built he said to a representative not one projects beyond its neighbor 
 it is made of that moment a bullet broke the cross on his breast and he fell 
 the cowards people said 
 let them show themselves 
 let us see them 
 they dare not 
 they are hiding 
 the barricade of the faubourg du temple defended by eighty men attacked by ten thousand held out for three days 
 on the fourth they did as at zaatcha as at constantine they pierced the houses they came over the roofs the barricade was taken 
 not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight all were killed there with the exception of the leader barthelemy of whom we shall speak presently 
 the barricade was the tumult of thunders the barricade of the temple was silence 
 the difference between these two redoubts was the difference between the formidable and the sinister one seemed a maw the other a mask 
 admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed of a wrath and of an enigma one divined in the first barricade the dragon and behind the second the sphinx 
 these two fortresses had been erected by two men named the one cournet the other barthelemy 
 cournet made the barricade barthelemy the barricade of the temple each was the image of the man who had built it 
 cournet was a man of lofty stature he had broad shoulders a red face a crushing fist a bold heart a loyal soul a sincere and terrible eye intrepid energetic irascible stormy the most cordial of men the most formidable of combatants 
 war strife conflict were the very air he breathed and put him in a good humor 
 he had been an officer in the navy and from his gestures and his voice one divined that he sprang from the ocean and that he came from the tempest he carried the hurricane on into battle 
 with the exception of the genius there was in cournet something of danton as with the exception of the divinity there was in danton something of hercules 
 barthelemy thin feeble pale taciturn was a sort of tragic street urchin who having had his ears boxed by a policeman lay in wait for him and killed him and at seventeen was sent to the galleys 
 he came out and made this barricade 
 later on fatal circumstance in london proscribed by all barthelemy slew cournet 
 it was a funereal duel 
 some time afterwards caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part a catastrophe in which french justice sees extenuating circumstances and in which english justice sees only death barthelemy was hanged 
 the sombre social construction is so made that thanks to material destitution thanks to moral obscurity that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence certainly firm possibly great began in france with the galleys and ended in england with the gallows 
 barthelemy on occasion flew but one flag the black flag

 the rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees denisov the esaul and petya rode silently following the peasant in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves silently led them to the edge of the forest 
 he ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense on reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand 
 denisov and petya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the french immediately beyond the forest on a downward slope lay a field of spring rye to the right beyond a steep ravine was a small village and a house with a broken roof in the village in the house in the garden by the well by the pond over all the rising ground and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards away crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist their shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts and their calls to one another could be clearly heard 
 bwing the prisoner here said denisov in a low voice not taking his eyes off the french 
 a cossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took him to denisov pointing to the french troops denisov asked him what these and those of them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers merely assenting to everything denisov asked him denisov turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to him 
 petya rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now at denisov now at the esaul and now at the french in the village and along the road trying not to miss anything of importance 
 whether dolokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes 
 it is a very suitable spot said the esaul 
 send the infantwy down by the swamps denisov continued cweep up to the garden wide up fwom there with the cossacks he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village and i with my hussars fwom here and at the signal shot 
 the hollow is impassable a swamp there said the esaul the horses would sink we must ride round more to the left 
 while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared then another and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices shouting together came up from the slope for a moment denisov and the esaul drew back they were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting did not relate to them down below a man wearing something red was running through the marsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at him 
 why our tikhon said the esaul 
 so it is it is 
 the wascal said denisov 
 get away said the esaul screwing up his eyes 
 the man whom they called tikhon having run to the stream plunged in so that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for an instant scrambled out on all fours all black with the wet and ran on the french who had been pursuing him stopped 
 smart that said the esaul 
 what a beast said denisov with his former look of vexation what has he been doing all this time 
 who is he asked petya 
 our plastun i sent him to capture a tongue 
 oh yes said petya nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if he understood it all though he really did not understand anything of it 
 tikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band he was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when denisov had come to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the french the elder as though shielding himself had replied as all village elders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them but when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french and asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some had really been at their village but that tikhon shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters denisov had tikhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few words in the presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish 
 we do the french any harm said tikhon evidently frightened by words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you know we killed a score or so of but we did no harm else 
 next day when denisov had left pokrovsk having quite forgotten about this peasant it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov gave orders to let him do so 
 tikhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water flaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and always brought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bring in french captives also denisov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the cossacks 
 tikhon did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carried rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons in party he held a peculiar and exceptional position when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done to push a cart out of the mud with shoulders pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk more than thirty miles in a day everybody pointed laughingly at tikhon 
 it hurt that devil as strong as a horse they said of him 
 once a frenchman tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment jokes in which tikhon readily joined 
 hallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossacks would banter him and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effect of this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners 
 he was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found more opportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmen and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role now he had been sent by denisov overnight to shamshevo to capture a tongue but whether because he had not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept through the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among the french and as denisov had witnessed from above had been detected by them

 what is to be done in the abyss if one does not converse 
 sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection and june knew a great deal more about it than june so the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie was only an outline and an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched but it was formidable for that epoch 
 the insurgents under the eye of enjolras for marius no longer looked after anything had made good use of the night 
 the barricade had been not only repaired but augmented 
 they had raised it two feet bars of iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest all sorts of rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external confusion 
 the redoubt had been cleverly made over into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside 
 the staircase of which permitted one to mount it like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed 
 the barricade had been put in order the disencumbered the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance the dressing of the wounded completed the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up bullets run cartridges manufactured lint scraped the fallen weapons the interior of the redoubt cleaned the rubbish swept up corpses removed 
 they laid the dead in a heap in the mondetour lane of which they were still the masters 
 the pavement was red for a long time at that spot among the dead there were four national guardsmen of the suburbs enjolras had their uniforms laid aside 
 enjolras had advised two hours of sleep 
 advice from enjolras was a command 
 still only three or four took advantage of it 
 feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the wall which faced the tavern 
 long live the peoples 
 these four words hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail could be still read on the wall in 
 the three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish definitely which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely 
 they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house 
 the greater part of the wounded were able and wished to fight still on a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen which had been converted into an ambulance there were five men gravely wounded two of whom were municipal guardsmen 
 the municipal guardsmen were attended to first 
 in the there remained only mabeuf under his black cloth and javert bound to his post 
 this is the hall of the dead said enjolras 
 in the interior of this hall barely lighted by a candle at one end the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar a sort of vast vague cross resulted from javert erect and mabeuf lying prone 
 the pole of the omnibus although snapped off by the fusillade was still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it

 no repast had been possible 
 there was neither bread nor meat the fifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of the during the sixteen hours which they had passed there 
 at a given moment every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of la meduse 
 they were obliged to resign themselves to hunger they had then reached the first hours of that spartan day of the th of june when in the barricade jeanne surrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread replied to all combatants crying something to eat with 
 why 
 it is three at four we shall be dead 
 as they could no longer eat enjolras forbade them to drink he interdicted wine and portioned out the brandy

 if he were on foot there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving those in spite of all murmurs placed his veto on the fifteen bottles and in order that no one might touch them he had them placed under the table on which father mabeuf was lying 
 about two in the morning they reckoned up their strength there were still of them 
 the day began to dawn 
 the torch which had been replaced in its cavity in the pavement had just been extinguished 
 the interior of the barricade that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street was bathed in shadows and resembled athwart the vague twilight horror the deck of a disabled ship 
 the combatants as they went and came moved about there like black forms above that terrible of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly outlined at the very top the chimneys stood palely out 
 the sky was of that charming undecided hue which may be white and may be blue 
 birds flew about in it with cries of joy 
 the lofty house which formed the back of the barricade being turned to the east had upon its roof a rosy reflection the morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man at the window 
 i am delighted that the torch has been extinguished said courfeyrac to feuilly 
 that torch flickering in the wind annoyed me it had the appearance of being afraid 
 the light of torches resembles the wisdom of cowards it gives a bad light because it trembles 
 dawn awakens minds as it does the birds all began to talk 
 joly perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter extracted philosophy from it 
 what is the cat he exclaimed 
 it is a corrective 
 the good god having made the mouse said 
 hullo i have committed a blunder and so he made the cat 
 the cat is the erratum of the mouse the mouse plus the cat is the proof of creation revised and corrected 
 combeferre surrounded by students and artisans was speaking of the dead of jean prouvaire of bahorel of mabeuf and even of cabuc and of enjolras sad severity 
 he said 
 harmodius and aristogiton brutus chereas stephanus cromwell charlotte corday sand have all had their moment of agony when it was too late 
 our hearts quiver so and human life is such a mystery that even in the case of a civic murder even in a murder for liberation if there be such a thing the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race 
 and such are the windings of the exchange of speech that a moment later by a transition brought about through jean verses combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgics raux with cournand cournand with delille pointing out the passages translated by malfilatre particularly the prodigies of death and at that word caesar the conversation reverted to brutus 
 caesar said combeferre fell justly 
 cicero was severe towards caesar and he was right 
 that severity is not diatribe 
 when zoilus insults homer when maevius insults virgil when vise insults moliere when pope insults shakspeare when frederic insults voltaire it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out genius attracts insult great men are always more or less barked at but zoilus and cicero are two different persons 
 cicero is an arbiter in thought just as brutus is an arbiter by the sword 
 for my own part i blame that last justice the blade but antiquity admitted it caesar the violator of the rubicon conferring as though they came from him the dignities which emanated from the people not rising at the entrance of the senate committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant regia ac pene tyrannica he was a great man so much the worse or so much the better the lesson is but the more exalted 
 his wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of jesus christ caesar is stabbed by the senators christ is cuffed by lackeys one feels the god through the greater outrage 
 bossuet who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap of exclaimed rifle in hand 
 oh cydathenaeum oh myrrhinus oh probalinthus oh graces of the aeantides 
 oh 
 who will grant me to pronounce the verses of homer like a greek of laurium or of edapteon

 dawn awakens minds as it does the birds all began to talk 
 joly perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter extracted philosophy from it 
 what is the cat he exclaimed 
 it is a corrective 
 the good god having made the mouse said 
 hullo i have committed a blunder and so he made the cat 
 the cat is the erratum of the mouse the mouse plus the cat is the proof of creation revised and corrected 
 combeferre surrounded by students and artisans was speaking of the dead of jean prouvaire of bahorel of mabeuf and even of cabuc and of enjolras sad severity 
 he said 
 harmodius and aristogiton brutus chereas stephanus cromwell charlotte corday sand have all had their moment of agony when it was too late 
 our hearts quiver so and human life is such a mystery that even in the case of a civic murder even in a murder for liberation if there be such a thing the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race 
 and such are the windings of the exchange of speech that a moment later by a transition brought about through jean verses combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgics raux with cournand cournand with delille pointing out the passages translated by malfilatre particularly the prodigies of death and at that word caesar the conversation reverted to brutus 
 caesar said combeferre fell justly 
 cicero was severe towards caesar and he was right 
 that severity is not diatribe 
 when zoilus insults homer when maevius insults virgil when vise insults moliere when pope insults shakspeare when frederic insults voltaire it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out genius attracts insult great men are always more or less barked at but zoilus and cicero are two different persons 
 cicero is an arbiter in thought just as brutus is an arbiter by the sword 
 for my own part i blame that last justice the blade but antiquity admitted it caesar the violator of the rubicon conferring as though they came from him the dignities which emanated from the people not rising at the entrance of the senate committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant regia ac pene tyrannica he was a great man so much the worse or so much the better the lesson is but the more exalted 
 his wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of jesus christ caesar is stabbed by the senators christ is cuffed by lackeys one feels the god through the greater outrage 
 bossuet who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap of exclaimed rifle in hand 
 oh cydathenaeum oh myrrhinus oh probalinthus oh graces of the aeantides 
 oh 
 who will grant me to pronounce the verses of homer like a greek of laurium or of edapteon

 after talking for some time with the esaul about next attack which now seeing how near they were to the french he seemed to have definitely decided on denisov turned his horse and rode back 
 now my lad go and get dwy he said to petya 
 as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into the forest among the trees a man with long legs and long swinging arms wearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazan hat was approaching with long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle when he espied denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim and approached his commander it was tikhon his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with merriment he lifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh 
 well where did you disappear to inquired denisov 
 where did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answered tikhon boldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voice 
 why did you push yourself in there by daylight you ass well why you taken one 
 oh i took one all right said tikhon 
 where is he 
 you see i took him first thing at dawn tikhon continued spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes i took him into the forest then i see no good and think go and fetch a likelier one 
 you see what a wogue just as i thought said denisov to the esaul why you bwing that one 
 what was the good of bringing him tikhon interrupted hastily and angrily that one have done for you as if i know what sort you want 
 what a bwute you are well 
 i went for another one tikhon continued and i crept like this through the wood and lay down he suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it one turned up and i grabbed him like this he jumped up quickly and lightly come along to the colonel i said he starts yelling and suddenly there were four of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i went for them with my ax this way what are you up to says i christ be with you shouted tikhon waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest 
 yes we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles said the esaul screwing up his glittering eyes 
 petya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained from laughing he turned his eyes rapidly from face to the and unable to make out what it all meant 
 play the fool said denisov coughing angrily why you bwing the first one 
 tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was called shcherbaty the denisov smiled and petya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which tikhon himself joined 
 oh but he was a regular said tikhon the clothes on him poor stuff how could i bring him and so rude your honor why he says a son myself i go he says 
 you are a bwute said denisov i wanted to question 
 but i questioned him said tikhon he said he know much there are a lot of us he says but all poor stuff only soldiers in name he says shout loud at them he says and take them all tikhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely into eyes 
 give you a hundwed sharp lashes teach you to play the fool said denisov severely 
 but why are you angry remonstrated tikhon just as if never seen your frenchmen only wait till it gets dark and fetch you any of them you want three if you like 
 well go said denisov and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily 
 tikhon followed behind and petya heard the cossacks laughing with him and at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes 
 when the fit of laughter that had seized him at words and smile had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed a man he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he felt it necessary to hold his head higher to brace himself and to question the esaul with an air of importance about undertaking that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself 
 the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the news that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him 
 denisov at once cheered up and calling petya to him said well tell me about yourself

 light and shadow 
 enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance 
 he had made his way out through mondetour lane gliding along close to the houses 
 the insurgents we will remark were full of hope 
 the manner in which they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn 
 they waited for it with a smile 
 they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause 
 moreover succor was evidently on the way to them they reckoned on it 
 with that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one of the sources of strength in the french combatant they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases at six in the morning a regiment which had been labored with would turn at noon the insurrection of all paris at sunset revolution 
 they heard the alarm bell of which had not been silent for an instant since the night before a proof that the other barricade the great one still held out 
 all these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of bees 
 enjolras reappeared 
 he returned from his sombre eagle flight into outer darkness 
 he listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms and one hand on his mouth 
 then fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of the dawn he said 
 the whole army of paris is to strike 
 a third of the army is bearing down upon the barricades in which you now are 
 there is the national guard in addition 
 i have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line and the of the sixth legion 
 in one hour you will be attacked 
 as for the populace it was seething yesterday it is not stirring 
 there is nothing to expect nothing to hope for neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment 
 you are abandoned 
 these words fell upon the buzzing of the groups and produced on them the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm a moment of indescribable silence ensued in which death might have been heard flitting by 
 this moment was brief 
 a voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to enjolras 
 so be it 
 let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet and let us all remain in it 
 citizens let us offer the protests of corpses 
 let us show that if the people abandon the republicans the republicans do not abandon the people 
 these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individual anxieties 
 it was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation 
 no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus he was some unknown a stranger a man forgotten a passing hero that great anonymous always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who at a given moment utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute in a lightning flash the people and god 
 this inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the th of june that almost at the very same hour on the barricade the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the matters it whether they come to our assistance or not 
 let us get ourselves killed here to the very last man 
 as the reader sees the two barricades though materially isolated were in communication with each other

 petya having left his people after their departure from moscow joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment from the time he received his commission and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of vyazma petya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not 
 when on the of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to detachment petya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalled mad action at the battle of vyazma where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his pistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of that was why petya had blushed and grown confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw the french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people change their views that the general whom he had greatly respected till then was a rubbishy german that denisov was a hero the esaul a hero and tikhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty 
 it was already growing dusk when denisov petya and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be seen and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french could not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse a cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the room three officers of band were converting a door into a tabletop petya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table 
 in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the table were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and salt 
 sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands down which the grease trickled petya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way 
 so then what do you think vasili dmitrich said he to denisov all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he answered his own question you see i was told to find out well i am finding out only do let me into the very into the chief i want a reward but i want 
 petya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head and flourishing his arms 
 into the vewy chief denisov repeated with a smile 
 only please let me command something so that i may really command petya went on what would it be to you oh you want a knife he said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton 
 and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it 
 please keep it i have several like it said petya blushing heavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have some raisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and he has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something sweet would you like some and petya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins have some gentlemen have some 
 you want a coffeepot you he asked the esaul i bought a capital one from our sutler he has splendid things and very honest the chief thing be sure to send it to you or perhaps your flints are giving out or are worn out that happens sometimes you know i have brought some with me here they are and he showed a bag a hundred flints i bought them very cheap please take as many as you want or all if you like 
 then suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much petya stopped and blushed 
 he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish and running over the events of the day he remembered the french drummer boy capital for us here but what of him where have they put him have they fed him they hurt his feelings he thought but having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was now afraid to speak out 
 i might ask he thought but say a boy himself and so he pities the boy show them tomorrow whether a boy will it seem odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and immediately blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical he said 
 may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat perhaps 
 yes a poor little fellow said denisov who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder call him in his name is vincent bosse have him fetched 
 call him said petya 
 yes yes call him a poor little fellow denisov repeated 
 petya was standing at the door when denisov said this he slipped in between the officers came close to denisov and said 
 let me kiss you dear old fellow oh how fine how splendid 
 and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut 
 bosse vincent petya cried stopping outside the door 
 who do you want sir asked a voice in the darkness 
 petya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that day 
 ah vesenny said a cossack 
 vincent the name had already been changed by the cossacks into vesenny vernal and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers in both these adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched the impression made by the young lad 
 he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya vesenya vesenny laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness 
 a smart lad said an hussar standing near petya we gave him something to eat a while ago he was awfully hungry 
 the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness and the drummer boy came to the door 
 ah vous said petya manger pas peur on ne vous fera pas de mal he added shyly and affectionately touching the hand entrez entrez 
 ah you do you want something to eat be afraid they hurt you 
 come in come in 
 merci monsieur said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold 
 thank you sir 
 there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy but did not dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage then in the darkness he took the hand and pressed it 
 come in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper oh what can i do for him he thought and opening the door he let the boy pass in first 
 when the boy had entered the hut petya sat down at a distance from him considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him but he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy

 chapter iv 
 
 minus five plus one 
 after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken and had given this formula of their common soul there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry funereal in sense and triumphant in tone 
 long live death 
 let us all remain here 
 why all said enjolras 
 all 
 all 
 enjolras resumed 
 the position is good the barricade is fine 
 thirty men are enough why sacrifice forty 
 they replied 
 because not one will go away 
 citizens cried enjolras and there was an almost irritated vibration in his voice this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in useless expenditure of them 
 is waste if the duty of some is to depart that duty should be fulfilled like any other 
 enjolras the had over his that sort of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute 
 still great as was this omnipotence a murmur arose 
 a leader to the very enjolras seeing that they murmured insisted 
 he resumed haughtily 
 let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so 
 the murmurs redoubled 
 besides observed a voice in one group it is easy enough to talk about leaving 
 the barricade is hemmed in 
 not on the side of the halles said enjolras 
 the rue mondetour is free and through the rue des precheurs one can reach the marche des innocents 
 and there went on another voice you would be captured you would fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs they will spy a man passing in blouse and cap 
 whence come you you belong to the barricade 
 and they will look at your hands you smell of powder 
 shot 
 enjolras without making any reply touched shoulder and the two entered the 
 they emerged thence a moment later 
 enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside combeferre followed carrying the and the shakos 
 with this uniform said enjolras you can mingle with the ranks and escape here is enough for four 
 and he flung on the ground deprived of its pavement the four uniforms 
 no wavering took place in his stoical audience 
 combeferre took the word 
 come said he you must have a little pity 
 do you know what the question is here 
 it is a question of women 
 see here 
 are there women or are there not 
 are there children or are there not are there mothers yes or no who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them 
 let that man of you who has never beheld a breast raise his hand 
 ah you want to get yourselves killed so do who am speaking to you but i do not want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their arms around me 
 die if you will but make others die suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here are sublime but suicide is narrow and does not admit of extension and as soon as it touches your neighbors suicide is murder think of the little blond heads think of the white locks listen enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the rue du cygne a lighted casement a candle in a poor window on the fifth floor and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman who had the air of having spent the night in watching perhaps she is the mother of some one of you 
 well let that man go and make haste to say to his mother 
 here i am mother 
 let him feel at ease the task here will be performed all the same when one supports relatives by toil one has not the right to sacrifice self 
 that is deserting family and those who have daughters what are you thinking of 
 you get yourselves killed you are dead that is well 
 and tomorrow 
 young girls without is a terrible thing 
 man begs woman sells ah those charming and gracious beings so gracious and so sweet who have bonnets of flowers who fill the house with purity who sing and prattle who are like a living perfume who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth that jeanne that lise that mimi those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride ah good god they will suffer hunger what do you want me to say to you 
 there is a market for human flesh and it is not with your shadowy hands shuddering around them that you will prevent them from entering it 
 think of the street think of the pavement covered with think of the shops past which women go and come with necks all bare and through the mire these women too were pure once 
 think of your sisters those of you who have them 
 misery prostitution the police that is what those beautiful delicate girls those fragile marvels of modesty gentleness and loveliness fresher than lilacs in the month of may will come to 
 ah you have got yourselves killed you are no longer on hand 
 that is well you have wished to release the people from royalty and you deliver over your daughters to the police 
 friends have a care have mercy 
 women unhappy women we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them we trust to the women not having received a education we prevent their reading we prevent their thinking we prevent their occupying themselves with politics will you prevent them from going to the this evening and recognizing your bodies let us see those who have families must be tractable and shake hands with us and take themselves off and leave us here alone to attend to this affair 
 i know well that courage is required to leave that it is hard but the harder it is the more meritorious you say 
 i have a gun i am at the barricade so much the worse i shall remain there 
 so much the worse is easily said 
 my friends there is a morrow you will not be here but your families will and what sufferings 
 see here is a pretty healthy child with cheeks like an apple who babbles prattles chatters who laughs who smells sweet beneath your do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned 
 i have seen one a very small creature no taller than that 
 his father was dead 
 poor people had taken him in out of charity but they had bread only for themselves the child was always hungry 
 it was winter 
 he did not cry you could see him approach the stove in which there was never any fire and whose pipe you know was of mastic and yellow clay his breathing was hoarse his face livid his limbs flaccid his belly prominent 
 he said nothing 
 if you spoke to him he did not answer 
 he is dead 
 he was taken to the necker hospital where i saw him 
 i was in that hospital 
 now if there are any fathers among you fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their tiny hand in their robust hand let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own that poor brat i remember and i seem to see him now when he lay nude on the dissecting table how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery 
 a sort of mud was found in his stomach 
 there were ashes in his teeth 
 come let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is per cent 
 i repeat it is a question of women it concerns mothers it concerns young girls it concerns little children 
 who is talking to you of yourselves 
 we know well what you are we know well that you are all brave parbleu we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently and that each one of you clings to his share in the triumph 
 very well 
 but you are not alone in this world there are other beings of whom you must think 
 you must not be egoists 
 all dropped their heads with a gloomy air 
 strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments 
 combeferre who spoke thus was not an orphan he recalled the mothers of other men and forgot his own he was about to get himself killed 
 he was an egoist 
 marius fasting fevered having emerged in succession from all hope and having been stranded in grief the most sombre of shipwrecks and saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted 
 a physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that febrile absorption known to and classified by science and which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure despair also has its ecstasy 
 marius had reached this point he looked on at everything as from without as we have said things which passed before him seemed far away he made out the whole but did not perceive the details 
 he beheld men going and coming as through a flame 
 he heard voices speaking as at the bottom of an abyss 
 but this moved him 
 there was in this scene a point which pierced and roused even him 
 he had but one idea now to die and he did not wish to be turned aside from it but he reflected in his gloomy somnambulism that while destroying himself he was not prohibited from saving some one else 
 he raised his voice 
 enjolras and combeferre are right said he no unnecessary sacrifice i join them and you must make haste 
 combeferre has said convincing things to you 
 there are some among you who have families mothers sisters wives children 
 let such leave the ranks 
 no one stirred 
 married men and the supporters of families step out of the ranks repeated marius 
 his authority was great 
 enjolras was certainly the head of the barricade but marius was its savior 
 i order it cried enjolras 
 i entreat you said marius 
 then touched by words shaken by enjolras order touched by marius entreaty these heroic men began to denounce each is true said one young man to a full grown man you are the father of a family 
 is your duty rather retorted the man you have two sisters whom you maintain and an unprecedented controversy broke forth 
 each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be placed at the door of the tomb 
 make haste said courfeyrac in another quarter of an hour it will be too late 
 citizens pursued enjolras this is the republic and universal suffrage reigns 
 do you yourselves designate those who are to go 
 they obeyed 
 after the expiration of a few minutes five were unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks 
 there are five of them exclaimed marius 
 there were only four uniforms 
 well began the five one must stay behind 
 and then a struggle arose as to who should remain and who should find reasons for the others not remaining 
 the generous quarrel began afresh 
 you have a wife who loves have your aged mother you have neither father nor mother and what is to become of your three little are the father of five have a right to live you are only seventeen it is too early for you to die 
 these great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism the improbable was simple there 
 these men did not astonish each other 
 be quick repeated courfeyrac 
 men shouted to marius from the groups 
 do you designate who is to remain 
 yes said the five choose 
 we will obey you 
 marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion still at this idea that of choosing a man for death his blood rushed back to his heart 
 he would have turned pale had it been possible for him to become any paler 
 he advanced towards the five who smiled upon him and each with his eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history hovering over thermopylae cried to him 
 me me me 
 and marius stupidly counted them there were still five of them then his glance dropped to the four uniforms 
 at that moment a fifth uniform fell as if from heaven upon the other four 
 the fifth man was saved 
 marius raised his eyes and recognized m fauchelevent 
 jean valjean had just entered the barricade 
 he had arrived by way of mondetour lane whither by dint of inquiries made or by instinct or chance 
 thanks to his dress of a national guardsman he had made his way without difficulty 
 the sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the rue mondetour had no occasion to give the alarm for a single national guardsman and he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street saying to himself 
 probably it is a reinforcement in any case it is a prisoner 
 the moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and his post of observation 
 at the moment when jean valjean entered the redoubt no one had noticed him all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms 
 jean valjean also had seen and heard and he had silently removed his coat and flung it on the pile with the rest 
 the emotion aroused was indescribable 
 who is this man demanded bossuet 
 he is a man who saves others replied combeferre 
 marius added in a grave voice 
 i know him 
 this guarantee satisfied every one 
 enjolras turned to jean valjean 
 welcome citizen 
 and he added 
 you know that we are about to die 
 jean valjean without replying helped the insurgent whom he was saving to don his uniform

 minus five plus one 
 after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken and had given this formula of their common soul there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry funereal in sense and triumphant in tone 
 long live death 
 let us all remain here 
 why all said enjolras 
 all 
 all 
 enjolras resumed 
 the position is good the barricade is fine 
 thirty men are enough why sacrifice forty 
 they replied 
 because not one will go away 
 citizens cried enjolras and there was an almost irritated vibration in his voice this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in useless expenditure of them 
 is waste if the duty of some is to depart that duty should be fulfilled like any other 
 enjolras the had over his that sort of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute 
 still great as was this omnipotence a murmur arose 
 a leader to the very enjolras seeing that they murmured insisted 
 he resumed haughtily 
 let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so 
 the murmurs redoubled 
 besides observed a voice in one group it is easy enough to talk about leaving 
 the barricade is hemmed in 
 not on the side of the halles said enjolras 
 the rue mondetour is free and through the rue des precheurs one can reach the marche des innocents 
 and there went on another voice you would be captured you would fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs they will spy a man passing in blouse and cap 
 whence come you you belong to the barricade

 the arrival of dolokhov diverted attention from the drummer boy to whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners petya had heard in the army many stories of extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the french so from the moment he entered the hut petya did not take his eyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his head high that he might not be unworthy even of such company 
 appearance amazed petya by its simplicity 
 denisov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas the on his breast and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position but dolokhov who in moscow had worn a persian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards he was and wore a padded coat with an order of st george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport of the message petya had brought and his own replies to both generals then he told him all he knew of the french detachment 
 so but we must know what troops they are and their numbers said dolokhov it will be necessary to go there we start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are i like to work accurately here now one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform 
 i i go with you cried petya 
 no need for you to go at all said denisov addressing dolokhov and as for him i let him go on any account 
 i like that exclaimed petya why i go 
 because useless 
 well you must excuse me because because i shall go and all take me you he said turning to dolokhov 
 why not dolokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of the french drummer boy have you had that youngster with you long he asked denisov 
 he was taken today but he knows nothing keeping him with me 
 yes and where do you put the others inquired dolokhov 
 where i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted denisov suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single life on my conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort instead of staining i speak bluntly staining the honor of a soldier 
 that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen said dolokhov with cold irony but time for you to drop it 
 why not said anything i only say that certainly go with you said petya shyly 
 but for you and me old fellow time to drop these amenities continued dolokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated denisov now why have you kept this lad he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for him we know those receipts of yours you send a hundred men away and thirty get there the rest either starve or get killed so it all the same not to send them 
 the esaul screwing up his eyes nodded approvingly 
 not the point not going to discuss the matter i do not wish to take it on my conscience you say die all wight only not by my fault 
 dolokhov began laughing 
 who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if they did catch me string me up to an aspen tree and with all your chivalry just the same he paused however we must get to work tell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in it well are you coming with me he asked petya 
 i yes yes certainly cried petya blushing almost to tears and glancing at denisov 
 while dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with prisoners petya had once more felt awkward and restless but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if distinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought he but above all denisov must not dare to imagine that obey him and that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp with dolokhov if he can so can i 
 and to all persuasions petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that he never considered personal danger 
 for admit that if we know for sure how many of them there are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two of us besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so hinder me said he it will only make things worse

 book war between four walls 
 chapter v 
 
 the horizon which one beholds from the summit of a barricade 
 the situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place had as result and culminating point enjolras supreme melancholy 
 enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution he was incomplete however so far as the absolute can be so he had too much of about him and not enough of anacharsis cloots still his mind in the society of the friends of the a b c had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from ideas for some time past he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma and had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress and he had come to accept as a definitive and magnificent evolution the transformation of the great french republic into the immense human republic as far as the immediate means were concerned a violent situation being given he wished to be violent on that point he never varied and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up in the words 
 enjolras was standing erect on the staircase of one elbow resting on the stock of his gun

 the horizon which one beholds from the summit of a barricade 
 the situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place had as result and culminating point enjolras supreme melancholy 
 enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution he was incomplete however so far as the absolute can be so he had too much of about him and not enough of anacharsis cloots still his mind in the society of the friends of the a b c had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from ideas for some time past he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma and had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress and he had come to accept as a definitive and magnificent evolution the transformation of the great french republic into the immense human republic as far as the immediate means were concerned a violent situation being given he wished to be violent on that point he never varied and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up in the words 
 enjolras was standing erect on the staircase of one elbow resting on the stock of his gun 
 he was engaged in thought he quivered as at the passage of prophetic breaths places where death is have these effects of tripods

 having put on french greatcoats and shakos petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow on reaching the bottom dolokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge petya his heart in his mouth with excitement rode by his side 
 if caught i be taken alive i have a pistol whispered he 
 talk russian said dolokhov in a hurried whisper and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge qui vive and the click of a musket 
 who goes there 
 the blood rushed to face and he grasped his pistol 
 lanciers du me replied dolokhov neither hastening nor slackening his pace 
 lancers of the th regiment 
 the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge 
 mot 
 password 
 dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk 
 dites donc le colonel gerard est ici he asked 
 tell me is colonel gerard here 
 mot repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replying 
 quand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel je vous demande si le colonel est ici 
 when an officer is making his round sentinels ask him for the password i am asking you if the colonel is here 
 and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stepped aside dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk 
 noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were the man a soldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up to horse touched it with his hand and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm as he called the house 
 having ridden up the road on both sides of which french talk could be heard around the campfires dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire around which sat several men talking noisily something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat lit up by the fire was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod 
 oh a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire 
 make them get a move on those fellows said another laughing 
 both fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound of and steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses 
 bonjour messieurs said dolokhov loudly and clearly 
 good day gentlemen 
 there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire and one tall officer walking round the fire came up to dolokhov 
 is that you clement he asked where the devil but noticing his mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as a stranger asking what he could do for him 
 dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the th regiment none of them knew anything and petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov with hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silent 
 if you were counting on the evening soup you have come too late said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh 
 dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night 
 he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged dolokhov as if he had not heard the question did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from cossacks 
 those brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind the fire 
 dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments he added inquiringly no one replied 
 well now come away petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk 
 but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion how many battalions and how many prisoners asking about the russian prisoners with that detachment dolokhov said 
 a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one it would be better to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so strange that petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire 
 no one replied a word to laughter and a french officer whom they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whispered something to a companion dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses 
 will they bring our horses or not thought petya instinctively drawing nearer to dolokhov 
 the horses were brought 
 good evening gentlemen said dolokhov 
 petya wished to say good night but could not utter a word the officers were whispering together dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at a footpace petya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether or no the french were running after them but not daring to 
 coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the open country but through the village at one spot he stopped and listened do you hear he asked petya recognized the sound of russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires when they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past the sentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it then they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them 
 well now tell denisov at the first shot at daybreak said dolokhov and was about to ride away but petya seized hold of him 
 really he cried you are such a hero oh how fine how splendid how i love you 
 all right all right said dolokhov but petya did not let go of him and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him dolokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse and vanished into the darkness

 marius haggard javert laconic 
 let us narrate what was passing in marius thoughts 
 let the reader recall the state of his soul 
 we have just recalled it everything was a vision to him now 
 his judgment was disturbed marius let us insist on this point was under the shadow of the great dark wings which are spread over those in the death agony he felt that he had entered the tomb it seemed to him that he was already on the other side of the wall and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead 
 how did m fauchelevent come there 
 why was he there 
 what had he come there to do 
 marius did not address all these questions to himself 
 besides since our despair has this peculiarity that it envelops others as well as ourselves it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to die 
 only he thought of cosette with a pang at his heart 
 however m fauchelevent did not speak to him did not look at him and had not even the air of hearing him when marius raised his voice to say 
 i know him 
 as far as marius was concerned this attitude of m fauchelevent was comforting and if such a word can be used for such impressions we should say that it pleased him 
 he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man who was in his eyes both equivocal and imposing 
 moreover it had been a long time since he had seen him and this still further augmented the impossibility for marius timid and reserved nature 
 the five chosen men left the barricade by way of mondetour lane they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the national guard one of them wept as he took his leave 
 before setting out they embraced those who remained 
 when the five men sent back to life had taken their departure enjolras thought of the man who had been condemned to death 
 he entered the javert still bound to the post was engaged in meditation 
 do you want anything 
 enjolras asked him 
 javert replied 
 when are you going to kill me 
 wait 
 we need all our cartridges just at present 
 then give me a drink said javert 
 enjolras himself offered him a glass of water and as javert was pinioned he helped him to drink 
 is that all inquired enjolras 
 i am uncomfortable against this post replied javert you are not tender to have left me to pass the night here bind me as you please but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man 
 and with a motion of the head he indicated the body of m mabeuf 
 there was as the reader will remember a long broad table at the end of the room on which they had been running bullets and making cartridges 
 all the cartridges having been made and all the powder used this table was free 
 at enjolras command four insurgents unbound javert from the post while they were loosing him a fifth held a bayonet against his breast 
 leaving his arms tied behind his back they placed about his feet a slender but stout as is done to men on the point of mounting the scaffold which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in length and made him walk to the table at the end of the room where they laid him down closely bound about the middle of the body 
 by way of further security and by means of a rope fastened to his neck they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at escape impossible that sort of bond which is called in prisons a martingale which starting at the neck forks on the stomach and meets the hands after passing between the legs 
 while they were binding javert a man standing on the threshold was surveying him with singular attention 
 the shadow cast by this man made javert turn his head 
 he raised his eyes and recognized jean valjean 
 he did not even start but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark 
 it is perfectly simple

 the shadow cast by this man made javert turn his head 
 he raised his eyes and recognized jean valjean 
 he did not even start but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark 
 it is perfectly simple

 having returned to the hut petya found denisov in the passage he was awaiting return in a state of agitation anxiety and for having let him go 
 thank god he exclaimed yes thank god he repeated listening to rapturous account but devil take you i slept because of you well thank god now lie down we can still get a nap before morning 
 but no said petya i want to sleep yet besides i know myself if i fall asleep finished and then i am used to not sleeping before a battle 
 he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day 
 then noticing that denisov was asleep he rose and went out of doors 
 it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were still falling from the trees near the hut the black shapes of the cossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering 
 petya came out peered into the darkness and went up to the wagons someone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats in the dark petya recognized his own horse which he called karabakh though it was of ukranian breed and went up to it 
 well karabakh do some service tomorrow said he sniffing its nostrils and kissing it 
 why you asleep sir said a cossack who was sitting under a wagon 
 no ah likhachev that your name do you know i have only just come back been into the french camp 
 and petya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act just anyhow 
 well you should get some sleep now said the cossack 
 no i am used to this said petya i say the flints in your pistols worn out i brought some with me you want any you can have some 
 the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at petya 
 because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said petya some fellows do things just anyhow without preparation and then sorry for it afterwards i like that 
 just so said the cossack 
 oh yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen my saber for me got bl petya feared to tell a lie and the saber never had been sharpened can you do it 
 of course i can 
 likhachev got up rummaged in his pack and soon petya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon 
 i say are the lads asleep asked petya 
 some are and some like us 
 well and that boy 
 vesenny oh thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleep after his fright he was that glad 
 after that petya remained silent for a long time listening to the sounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared 
 what are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagon 
 why this saber 
 right said the man whom petya took to be an hussar was the cup left here 
 there by the wheel 
 the hussar took the cup 
 it must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away 
 petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with guerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that under it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark blotch to the right was the hut and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be the hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth perhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of an enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom perhaps it was just the cossack likhachev who was sitting under the wagon but it might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in the world whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply vanished disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness 
 nothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible 
 he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth it was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with hand 
 eyes began to close and he swayed a little 
 the trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed and jostled one another someone snored 
 hissed the saber against the whetstone and suddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown sweetly solemn hymn petya was as musical as natasha and more so than nicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive the music became more and more audible the melody grew and passed from one instrument to another and what was played was a fugue though petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is each instrument now resembling a violin and now a horn but better and clearer than violin or horn played its own part and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air and then with a third and a fourth and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended now into solemn church music now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant 
 oh why that was in a dream petya said to himself as he lurched forward in my ears but perhaps music of my own well go on my music now 
 he closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance sounds fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is delightful as much as i like and as i like said petya to himself he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra 
 now softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him now fuller more joyful still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds now voices join in ordered petya and at first from afar he heard voices and then the voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength and petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy 
 with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from the trees and the hissing of the saber and again the horses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the choir but joining in it 
 petya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all the time wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it he was awakened by kindly voice 
 ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it 
 petya woke up 
 getting light really getting light he exclaimed 
 the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches petya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to likhachev then he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths 
 and the commander said likhachev 
 denisov came out of the hut and having called petya gave orders to get ready

 book fourteen 
 chapter xi 
 
 the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightened their saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by the hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaul gave some orders to his men petya held his horse by the bridle impatiently awaiting the order to mount his face having been bathed in cold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly brilliant cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically 
 well is weady asked denisov bwing the horses 
 the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because the saddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted petya put his foot in the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg but petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode up to denisov 
 vasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for sake said he 
 denisov seemed to have forgotten very existence he turned to glance at him 
 i ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere 
 he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had all ridden by denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto their haunches and sliding the horses descended with their riders into the ravine petya rode beside denisov the pulsation of his body constantly increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hid distant objects having reached the valley denisov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him 
 the signal said he

 the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightened their saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by the hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaul gave some orders to his men petya held his horse by the bridle impatiently awaiting the order to mount his face having been bathed in cold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly brilliant cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically 
 well is weady asked denisov bwing the horses 
 the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because the saddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted petya put his foot in the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg but petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode up to denisov 
 vasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for sake said he 
 denisov seemed to have forgotten very existence he turned to glance at him 
 i ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere 
 he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had all ridden by denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto their haunches and sliding the horses descended with their riders into the ravine petya rode beside denisov the pulsation of his body constantly increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hid distant objects having reached the valley denisov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him 
 the signal said he 
 the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from various sides and then more shots

 a double quartette 
 these parisians came one from toulouse another from limoges the third from cahors and the fourth from montauban but they were students and when one says student one says study in paris is to be born in paris 
 these young men were insignificant every one has seen such faces four specimens of humanity taken at random neither good nor bad neither wise nor ignorant neither geniuses nor fools handsome with that charming april which is called twenty years 
 they were four oscars for at that epoch arthurs did not yet for him the perfumes of araby exclaimed advances 
 oscar i shall behold him 
 people had just emerged from ossian elegance was scandinavian and caledonian the pure english style was only to prevail later and the first of the arthurs wellington had but just won the battle of waterloo 
 these oscars bore the names one of felix tholomyes of toulouse the second listolier of cahors the next fameuil of limoges the last blachevelle of montauban 
 naturally each of them had his mistress 
 blachevelle loved favourite so named because she had been in england listolier adored dahlia who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower fameuil idolized zephine an abridgment of josephine tholomyes had fantine called the blonde because of her beautiful sunny hair 
 favourite dahlia zephine and fantine were four ravishing young women perfumed and radiant still a little like and not yet entirely divorced from their needles somewhat disturbed by intrigues but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman 
 one of the four was called the young because she was the youngest of them and one was called the old the old one was not to conceal anything the three first were more experienced more heedless and more emancipated into the tumult of life than fantine the blonde who was still in her first illusions 
 dahlia zephine and especially favourite could not have said as had already been more than one episode in their romance though hardly begun and the lover who had borne the name of adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second and gustave in the third 
 poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors one scolds and the other flatters and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear each on its own side 
 these badly guarded souls listen 
 hence the falls which they accomplish and the stones which are thrown at are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible 
 alas what if the jungfrau were hungry 
 favourite having been in england was admired by dahlia and had had an establishment of her own very early in father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics a brutal man and a braggart who went out to give lessons in spite of his professor when he was a young man had one day seen a gown catch on a fender he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident 
 the result had been favourite 
 she met her father from time to time and he bowed to her 
 one morning an old woman with the air of a devotee had entered her apartments and had said to her you do not know me mamemoiselle 
 no i am your the old woman opened the sideboard and ate and drank had a mattress which she owned brought in and installed cross and pious old mother never spoke to favourite remained hours without uttering a word breakfasted dined and supped for four and went down to the quarters for company where she spoke ill of her daughter

 how could she make such nails work 
 she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands 
 as for zephine she had conquered fameuil by her roguish and caressing little way of saying yes sir 
 the young men were comrades the young girls were loves are always accompanied by such friendships 
 goodness and philosophy are two distinct things the proof of this is that after making all due allowances for these little irregular households favourite zephine and dahlia were philosophical young women while fantine was a good girl 
 good some one will exclaim and tholomyes 
 solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom 
 we will confine ourselves to saying that the love of fantine was a first love a sole love a faithful love 
 she alone of all the four was not called thou by a single one of them

 though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown 
 she was born at m sur m of what parents 
 who can say 
 she had never known father or was called fantine 
 why fantine 
 she had never borne any other name 
 at the epoch of her birth the directory still had no family name she had no family no baptismal name the church no longer existed 
 she bore the name which pleased the first random who had encountered her when a very small child running in the street 
 she received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it was called little fantine 
 no one knew more than that 
 this human creature had entered life in just this way 
 at the age of ten fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood 
 at fifteen she came to paris to seek her was beautiful and remained pure as long as she was a lovely blonde with fine teeth 
 she had gold and pearls for her dowry but her gold was on her head and her pearls were in her mouth

 return of the jedi

 outside the small adobe hut the sandstorm wailed like a beast in agony refusing todie inside the sounds were muted 
 it was cooler in this shelter more hushed and darker while the beast withouthowled in this place of nuance and shadow a shrouded figure worked 
 tanned hands holding arcane tools extended from the sleeves of a caftanlikerobe the figure crouched on the ground working before him lay a discoiddevice of strange design wires trailing from it at one end symbols etched into its flatsurface he connected the wires end to a tubular smooth handle pulled through connector locked it in place with another tool he motioned to ashadow in the corner the shadow moved toward him 
 tentatively the obscure form rolled closer to the robed figure the little r unit questioned timidly as it approached pausing when it wasjust a foot from the shrouded man with the strange device 
 the shrouded man motioned the droid nearer still scooted the lastdistance blinking and the hands raised toward his domed little head 
 the fine sand blew hard over the dunes of tatooine the wind seemed to comefrom everywhere at once typhooning in spots swirling in here hoveringin stillness there without pattern or meaning 
 a road wound across the desert plain it nature changed constantly at onemoment obscured by drifts of ochre sand the next moment swept clean or distortedby the heat of the shimmering air above it a road more ephemeral than a road to be followed all the same for it was the only way to reach the palaceof jabba the hut 
 jabba was the vilest gangster in the galaxy he had his fingers in murder his minions scattered across the stars he both collected andinvented atrocities and his court was a den of unparalleled decay it was said bysome that jabba had chosen tatooine as his place of residence because only in thisarid crucible of a planet could he hope to keep his soul from rotting the parched sun might bake his humor to festering brine 
 in any case it was a place few of kind spirit even knew of let alone was a place of evil where even the most courageous felt their powers wilt under thefoul gaze of corruption 
 bedoo gung ooble deep vocalized 
 of course worried fussed and you should be too poorlando calrissian never returned from this place can you imagine what to him 
 artoo whistled timidly 
 the golden droid waded stiffly through a shifting sand hill then stopped short palace suddenly loomed suddenly dark in the near distance artoo almostbumped into him quickly skidding to the side of the road 
 watch where going artoo resumed walking but moreslowly his little friend rolling along at his side and as they went he chattered chewbacca have delivered this message no whenever animpossible mission they turn to us no one worries about droids sometimes iwonder why we put up with it all 
 on and on he rambled over the desolate final stretch of road until at last theyreached the gates to the palace massive iron doors taller than threepio of a series of stone and iron walls forming several gigantic cylindricaltowers that seemed to rise out of a mountain of packed sand 
 the two droids fearfully looked around the ominous door for signs of life orwelcome or some sort of signaling device with which to make their presence nothing in any of those categories mustered his resolve whichfunction had been programmed into him quite a long time earlier knocked softlythree times on the thick metal gate then quickly turned around and announced toartoo there seem to be anyone here go back and tell master luke 
 suddenly a small hatch opened in the center of the door a spindly mechanicalarm popped out affixed to which a large electronic eyeball peered unabashedly at thetwo droids the eyeball spoke 
 tee chuta hhat yudd 
 threepio stood erect proud though his circuits quivered a bit he faced the to artoo and then to himself artoo detoowha bo seethreepoiosha eytoota odd mischka jabba du hutt 
 the eye looked quickly from one robot to the other then retracted back throughthe little window and slammed the hatch shut 
 ganoong whispered artoo with concern 
 threepio nodded i think going to let us in artoo bettergo he turned to leave as artoo beeped a reluctant 
 at that a horrific grinding screech erupted and the massive iron door slowlybegan to rise the two droids looked at each other skeptically and then into theyawning black cavity that faced them they waited afraid to enter afraid to retreat 
 from the shadow the strange voice of the eye screamed at them nudd chaa 
 artoo beeped and rolled forward into the gloom threepio hesitated thenrushed after his stubby companion with a start artoo wait for me they stoppedtogether in a gaping passageway as threepio scolded get lost 
 the great door slammed shut behind them with a monumental crash that echoedthrough the dark cavern for a moment the two frightened robots stood therewithout moving then haltingly they stepped forward 
 they were immediately joined by three large gamorrean brutes whose racial hatred of robots was well known the guards usheredthe two droids down the dark corridor without so much as a nod when they reachedthe first hallway one of them grunted an order artoo beeped a nervousquery at threepio 
 you want to know the golden droid responded apprehensively justdeliver master message and get us out of here quick 
 before they could take another step a form approached them from the obscurityof a bib fortuna the inelegant of degeneratecourt he was a tall humanoid creature with eyes that saw only what was a robot that hid all protruding from the back of his skull were two appendages that exhibited prehensile sensual and cognitive functions atvarious he wore either draped over his shoulders for decorative effector when the situation called for balance hanging straight down behind him as if theywere twin tails 
 he smiled thinly as he stopped before the two robots die wanna wanga 
 threepio spoke up officially die wanna wanga we bring a message to yourmaster jabba the hutt artoo beeped a postscript upon which threepio noddedand added and a gift he thought about this a moment looked as puzzled as itwas possible for a droid to look and whispered loudly to artoo gift what gift 
 bib shook his head emphatically nee jabba no badda me chaade sugoodie he held out his hand toward artoo 
 the small droid backed up meekly but his protest was lengthy bdooo eengwrrr op dboodeeop 
 artoo give it to him threepio insisted sometimes artoo could be sobinary 
 at this though artoo became positively defiant beeping and tooting at fortunaand threepio as if both had their programs erased 
 threepio nodded finally hardly happy with answer he smiledapologetically at bib he says our instructions are to give it only to jabbahimself bib considered the problem a moment as threepio went on terribly sorry afraid ever so stubborn about these things hemanaged to throw a disparaging yet loving tone into his voice as he tilted his headtoward his small associate 
 bib gestured for them to follow nudd chaa he walked back into thedarkness the droids following close behind the three gamorrean guards lumberingalong at the rear 
 as descended into the belly of the shadow he muttered quietly tothe silent r unit artoo i have a bad feeling about this 
 and stood at the entrance of the throne room lookingin doomed whimpered threepio wishing for the thousandth time that hecould close his eyes 
 the room was filled wall to cavernous wall with the animate dregs of theuniverse grotesque creatures from the lowest star systems drunk on spiced liquorand their own fetid vapors gamorreans twisted humans reveling inbase pleasures or raucously comparing mean feats and at the front of the on a dais that overlooked the debauchery was jabba the hutt 
 his head was three times human size perhaps four his eyes were skin was like a as well except covered with a fine layer ofgrease he had no neck but only a series of chins that expanded finally into a greatbloated body engorged to bursting with stolen morsels stunted almost uselessarms sprouted from his upper torso the sticky fingers of his left hand languidlywrapped around the of his he had no had fallenout from a combination of diseases he had no trunk simply taperedgradually to a long plump that stretched along the length of the platformlike a tube of yeasty dough his lipless mouth was wide almost ear to ear and hedrooled continuously he was quite thoroughly disgusting 
 chained to him chained at the neck was a sad pretty a member species with two dry shapely tentacles sprouting from the back of her suggestively down her bare muscled back her name was oola lookingforlorn she sat as far away as her chain would allow at the other end of the dais 
 and sitting near belly was a small monkeylike reptile named salaciouscrumb who caught all the food and ooze that spilled out of hands or mouthand ate it with a nauseating cackle 
 shafts of light from above partially illuminated the drunken courtiers as bibfortuna crossed the floor to the dais the room was composed of an endless seriesof alcoves within alcoves so that much of what went on was in any case visible onlyas shadow and movement when fortuna reached the throne he delicately leanedforward and whispered into the slobbering ear eyes becameslitsthen with a maniacal laugh he motioned for the two terrified droids to bebrought in 
 bo shuda wheezed the hutt and lapsed into a fit of coughing although heunderstood several languages as a point of honor he only spoke huttese his onlysuch point 
 the quaking robots scooted forward to stand before the repulsive ruler thoughhe grossly violated their most deeply programmed sensibilities the the message threepio urged 
 artoo whistled once and a beam of light projected from his domed a hologram of luke skywalker that stood before them on the floor quicklythe image grew to over ten feet tall until the young jedi warrior towered over theassembled throng al at once the room grew quiet as giant presence madeitself felt 
 greetings exalted one the hologram said to jabba allow me to introducemyself i am luke skywalker jedi knight and friend of captain solo i seek anaudience with your greatness to bargain for his life at this the entire room burstinto laughter which jabba instantly stopped with a hand motion luke pauselong i know that you are powerful mighty jabba and that your anger with solomust be equally powerful but sure we can work out an arrangement which willbe mutually beneficial as a token of my good will i present to you a droids 
 threepio jumped back as if stung what what did he said 
 luke continued both are hardworking and will serve you will with hologram disappeared 
 threepio wagged his head in despair oh no this be artoo you musthave played the wrong message jabba laughed and drooled 
 bib spoke in huttese bargain rather than fight he is no jedi 
 jabba nodded in agreement still grinning he rasped at threepio there willbe no bargain i have no intention of giving up my favorite decoration with ahideous chuckle he looked toward the dimly lit alcove beside the throne flat against the wall was the carbonized form of han solo his face andhands emerging out of the cold hard slab like a statue reaching from a sea of stone 
 artoo and threepio marched dismally through the dank passageway at theprodding of a gamorrean guard dungeon cells lined both walls the unspeakablecries of anguish that emanated from within as the droids passed echoed off the stoneand down the endless catacombs periodically a hand or claw or tentacle wouldreach through the bars of a door to grab at the hapless robots 
 artoo beeped pitifully threepio only shook his head what could havepossibly come over master luke was it something i did he never expressed anyunhappiness with my work 
 they approached a door at the end of the corridor it slid open the gamorrean shoved them forward inside their ears were assaulted bydeafening machine creaking slamming a continuously shifting haze of steam made visibility short thiswas either the boiler room or programmed hell 
 an agonized electronic scream like the sound of stripping gears drew theirattention to the corner of the room from out of the mist walked a thinhumanlike robot with some disturbingly human appetites in the dimness behindninedenine threepio could see the legs being pulled off a droid on a torture a second droid hanging upside down was having irons applied to itsfeet it had emitted the electronic scream threepio heard a few moments earlier as thesensor circuits in its metal skin melted in agony threepio cringed at the sound hisown wiring sympathetically crackling with static electricity 
 ninedenine stopped in front of threepio raising her pincer hands new acquisitions she said with great satisfaction i am of cyborg operations a protocol droid you 
 i am re 
 yes or no will do ninedenine said icily 
 well yes threepio replied this robot was going to be trouble that muchwas of those droids who always had to prove she 
 how many languages do you speak ninedenine continued 
 well two can play that game thought threepio he ran his most introductory tape i am fluent in over six million forms of can 
 splendid ninedenine interrupted gleefully we have been without aninterpreter since the master got angry with something our last protocol droid said anddisintegrated him 
 disintegrated threepio wailed any semblance of protocol left him 
 ninedenine spoke to a pig guard who suddenly appeared this one will bequite useful fit him with a restraining bolt then take him back up to the mainaudience chamber 
 the guard grunted and roughly shoved threepio toward the door 
 artoo leave me threepio called out but the guard grabbed him andpulled him away and he was gone 
 artoo let out a long plaintive cry as threepio was removed then he turned toninedenine and beeped in outrage and at length 
 ninedenine laughed a feisty little one but soon learn somerespect i have need for you on the sail barge several of our astrodroidshave been disappearing for spare parts most likely i think in nicely 
 the droid on the torture rack emitted a wail then sparked brieflyand was silent 
 the court of jabba the hutt roiled in malignant ecstasy oola the beautifulcreature chained to jabba danced in the center of the floor as the inebriated monsterscheered and heckled threepio hovered warily near the back of the throne trying tokeep the lowest profile possible periodically he had to duck to avoid a fruit hurledin his direction or to sidestep a rolling body mostly he just stayed low what elsewas a protocol droid to do in a place of so little protocol 
 jabba leered through the smoke of his hooka and beckoned the creature oola tocome sit beside him she stopped dancing instantly a fearful look in her eye andbacked up shaking her head apparently she had suffered such invitations before 
 jabba became angry he pointed unmistakably to a spot beside him on the eitha he growled 
 oola shook her head more violently her face a mask of terror na chubanegatorie na na natoota 
 jabba became livid furiously he motioned to oola boscka 
 jabba pushed a button as he released chain before she could flee agrating trap door in the floor dropped open and she tumbled into the pit below thedoor snapped shut instantly a moment of silence followed by a low rumbling by a terrified shriek was followed once more by silence 
 jabba laughed until he slobbered a dozen revelers hurried over to peerthrough the grate to observe the demise of the nubile dancer 
 threepio shrank even lower and looked for support to the carbonite form of hansolo suspended in bas relief above the floor now there was a human without asense of protocol thought threepio wistfully 
 his reverie was interrupted by an unnatural quiet that suddenly fell over theroom he looked up to see bib fortuna making his way through the by two gamorrean guards and followed by a bounty hunter who led his captive prize on a leash wookiee 
 threepio gasped stunned oh no chewbacca the future was lookingvery bleak indeed 
 bib muttered a few words into ear pointing to the bounty hunter and hiscaptive jabba listened intently the bounty hunter was humanoid small and belt of cartridges was slung across his jerkin and an in his gavethe impression of his being able to see through things he bowed low then spoke influent ubese greeting majestic one i am boushh it was a metalliclanguage to the rarefied atmosphere of the home planet from which thisnomadic species arose 
 jabba answered in the same tongue though his ubese was stilted and slow atlast someone has brought me the mighty chewbacca he tried to continue butstuttered on the word he wanted with a roaring laugh he turned toward my talkdroid he boomed motioning threepio to come the courtly robot obeyed 
 jabba ordered him congenially welcome our mercenary friend and ask hisprice for the wookiee 
 threepio translated the message to the bounty hunter boushh listened studying the feral creatures around the room possible exits possiblehostages vulnerable points he particularly noticed boba near mercenary who had caught han solo 
 boushh assessed this all in a moment then spoke evenly in his nativetongue to threepio i will take fifty thousand no less 
 threepio quietly translated for jabba who immediately became enraged andknocked the golden droid off the raised throne with a sweep of his massive clattered in a heap on the floor where he rested momentarily uncertain ofthe correct protocol in this situation 
 jabba raved on in guttural huttese boushh shifted his weapon to a more usableposition threepio sighed struggled back onto the throne composed himself andtranslated for jabba was saying 
 thousand is all pay threepio instructed 
 jabba motioned his pig guards to take chewbacca as two jawas covered fett also raised his weapon jabba added to translation twentyfive thousand plus his life 
 threepio translated the room was silent tense uncertain finally boushhspoke softly to threepio 
 tell that swollen garbage bag have to do better than that or bepicking his smelly hide out of every crack in this room holding a thermaldetonator 
 threepio suddenly focused on the small silver ball boushh held partiallyconcealed in his left hand it could be heard humming a quiet ominous looked nervously at jabba then back at boushh 
 jabba barked at the droid well what did he say 
 threepio cleared his throat your grandness he uhhe 
 out with it droid jabba roared 
 oh dear threepio fretted he inwardly prepared himself for the worst thenspoke to jabba in flawless huttese boushh respectfully disagrees with yourexaltedness and begs you to reconsider the amountor he will release the thermaldetonator he is holding 
 instantly a disturbed murmuring circled in the room everyone backed upseveral feet as if that would help jabba stared at the ball clenched in the hand it was beginning to glow another tense hush came over theonlookers 
 jabba stared malevolently at the bounty hunter for several long seconds a satisfied grin crept over his vast ugly mouth from the bilious pit of hisbelly a laugh rose like gas in a mire this bounty hunter is my kind of and inventive tell him no warn him not to press hisluck 
 threepio felt greatly relieved by this turn of events he translated for studied the bounty hunter closely for his reaction guns were readied 
 then boushh released a switch on the thermal detonator and it went he nodded 
 he agrees threepio said to jabba 
 the crowd cheered jabba relaxed come my friend join our celebration imay find other work for you threepio translated as the party resumed in thedepraved revelry 
 chewbacca growled under his breath as he was led away by the might have cracked their heads just for being so ugly or to remind everyonepresent what a wookiee was made near the door he spotted a familiar behind a of teeth was a human in the uniform of a calrissian chewbacca gave no sign of recognition nor did he resistthe guard who now escorted him from the room 
 lando had managed to infiltrate this nest of maggots earlier to see if itwas possible to free solo from imprisonment done this for severalreasons 
 first because he felt correctly that it was his fault han was in this he wanted to make of course he could do so without gettinghurt blending in here like just one of the pirates was no problem for identity was a way of life with him 
 second he wanted to join forces with buddies at the top of the rebelalliance they were out to beat the empire and he wanted nothing more in his lifenow than to do just that the imperial police had moved in on his action once toooften so this was a grudge match now besides lando liked being part of since they seemed to be right up at the business end of all the action againstthe empire 
 third princess leia had asked him to help and he just never could refuse aprincess asking for help besides you never knew how she might thank you someday 
 finally lando would have bet anything that han simply could not be rescuedfrom this lando just plain resist a bet 
 so he spent his days watching a lot watching and calculating what hedid now as chewie was led watched and then he faded into the stonework 
 the band started playing led by a blue named max flooded the floor the courtiers hooted and brewed their brains a bit more 
 boushh leaned against a column surveying the scene his gaze swept coollyover the court taking in the dancers the smokers the rollers the gamblersuntil itcame to rest squarely on an equally unflappable stare from across the room bobafett was watching him 
 boushh shifted slightly posturing with his weapon cradled like a loving fett remained motionless an arrogant sneer all but visible behind his ominousmask 
 pig guards led chewbacca though the unlit dungeon corridor a tentacle coiledout one of the doors to touch the brooding wookiee 
 rheeaaahhr he screamed and the tentacle shot back into its cell 
 the next door was open before chewie fully realized what was happening hewas hurled forcefully into the cell by all the guards the door slammed shut lockinghim in darkness 
 he raised his head and let out a long pitiful howl that carried through the entiremountain of iron and sand up to the infinitely patient sky 
 the throne room was quiet dark and empty as right filled its littered wine and saliva stained the floor shreds of tattered clothing hung from thefixtures unconscious bodies curled under broken furniture the party was over 
 a dark figure moved silently among the shadows pausing behind a column statue there he made his way stealthily along the perimeter of the room steppingonce over a snoring yak face he never made a sound this was boushh thebounty hunter 
 he reached the curtained alcove beside which the slab that was han solo hungsuspended by a force field on the wall boushh looked around furtively then flippeda switch near the side of the carbonite coffin the humming of the force field wounddown and the heavy monolith slowly lowered to the floor 
 boushh stepped up and studied the frozen face of the space pirate he carbonized cheek curiously as if it were a rare precious stone cold andhard as diamond 
 for a few seconds he examined the controls at the side of the slab then activateda series of switches finally after one last hesitant glance at the living statue beforehim he slid the decarbonization lever into place 
 the casing began to emit in a sound anxiously boushh peered allaround again making certain no one heard slowly the hard shell that was coveringthe contours of face started to melt away soon the coating was gone fromthe entire front of body freeing his upraised long frozen fall slackly to his sides his face relaxed into what looked like nothingso much as a boushh extracted the lifeless body from its casing andlowered it gently to the floor 
 he leaned his gruesome helmet close to face listening closely for signs oflife no breath no pulse with a start eyes suddenly snapped open andhe began to cough boushh steadied him tried to quiet were still guardswho might hear 
 quiet he whispered just relax 
 han squinted up at the dim form above him i was understandably disoriented after having been in suspended animation for sixof this desert period that was to him timeless it had been agrim if for an eternity been trying to draw breath to move toscream every moment in conscious painful now suddenly he wasdumped into a loud black cold pit 
 his senses assaulted him all at once the air bit at his skin with a thousand icyteeth the opacity of his sight was impenetrable wind seemed to rush around his earsat hurricane volumes he feel which way was up the myriad smells filling hisnose made him nauseous he stop salivating all his bones thencame the visions 
 visions from his childhood from his last breakfast from if all the images and memories of his life had been crammed into aballoon and the balloon popped and they all came bursting out now randomly in asingle moment it was nearly overwhelming it was sensory overload or moreprecisely memory overload men had gone mad in these first minutes followingdecarbonization hopelessly utterly ever again to reorganize kind of coherent selective order 
 solo that susceptible he rode the surge of this tide of impressions untilit settled down to a churning backwash submerging the bulk of his memories leavingonly the most recent flotsam to foam on the surface his betrayal by lando once called friend his ailing ship his last view of leia his capture by bobafett the bounty hunter who 
 where was he now what had happened his last image was of boba fettwatching him turn into carbonite was this fett again now come to thaw him formore abuse the air roared in his ears his breathing felt irregular unnatural hebatted his hand in front of his face 
 boushh tried to reassure him free of the carbonite and havehibernation sickness your eyesight will return in time come we must hurry to leave this place 
 reflexively han grabbed the bounty hunter felt at the grated thendrew back i am not going even know where i am he begansweating profusely as his heart once again churned blood and his mind groped foranswers who are you anyway he demanded suspiciously perhaps it was fettafter all 
 the bounty hunter reached up and pulled the helmet away from his headrevealing underneath the beautiful face of princess leia 
 one who loves you she whispered taking his face tenderly in her still glovedhands and kissing him long on the lips

 return of the jedi 
 i 
 
 outside the small adobe hut the sandstorm wailed like a beast in agony refusing todie inside the sounds were muted 
 it was cooler in this shelter more hushed and darker while the beast withouthowled in this place of nuance and shadow a shrouded figure worked 
 tanned hands holding arcane tools extended from the sleeves of a caftanlikerobe the figure crouched on the ground working before him lay a discoiddevice of strange design wires trailing from it at one end symbols etched into its flatsurface he connected the wires end to a tubular smooth handle pulled through connector locked it in place with another tool he motioned to ashadow in the corner the shadow moved toward him 
 tentatively the obscure form rolled closer to the robed figure the little r unit questioned timidly as it approached pausing when it wasjust a foot from the shrouded man with the strange device 
 the shrouded man motioned the droid nearer still scooted the lastdistance blinking and the hands raised toward his domed little head 
 the fine sand blew hard over the dunes of tatooine the wind seemed to comefrom everywhere at once typhooning in spots swirling in here hoveringin stillness there without pattern or meaning 
 a road wound across the desert plain it nature changed constantly at onemoment obscured by drifts of ochre sand the next moment swept clean or distortedby the heat of the shimmering air above it a road more ephemeral than a road to be followed all the same for it was the only way to reach the palaceof jabba the hut 
 jabba was the vilest gangster in the galaxy he had his fingers in murder his minions scattered across the stars he both collected andinvented atrocities and his court was a den of unparalleled decay it was said bysome that jabba had chosen tatooine as his place of residence because only in thisarid crucible of a planet could he hope to keep his soul from rotting the parched sun might bake his humor to festering brine 
 in any case it was a place few of kind spirit even knew of let alone was a place of evil where even the most courageous felt their powers wilt under thefoul gaze of corruption 
 bedoo gung ooble deep vocalized 
 of course worried fussed and you should be too poorlando calrissian never returned from this place can you imagine what to him 
 artoo whistled timidly 
 the golden droid waded stiffly through a shifting sand hill then stopped short palace suddenly loomed suddenly dark in the near distance artoo almostbumped into him quickly skidding to the side of the road 
 watch where going artoo resumed walking but moreslowly his little friend rolling along at his side and as they went he chattered chewbacca have delivered this message no whenever animpossible mission they turn to us no one worries about droids sometimes iwonder why we put up with it all 
 on and on he rambled over the desolate final stretch of road until at last theyreached the gates to the palace massive iron doors taller than threepio of a series of stone and iron walls forming several gigantic cylindricaltowers that seemed to rise out of a mountain of packed sand 
 the two droids fearfully looked around the ominous door for signs of life orwelcome or some sort of signaling device with which to make their presence nothing in any of those categories mustered his resolve whichfunction had been programmed into him quite a long time earlier knocked softlythree times on the thick metal gate then quickly turned around and announced toartoo there seem to be anyone here go back and tell master luke 
 suddenly a small hatch opened in the center of the door a spindly mechanicalarm popped out affixed to which a large electronic eyeball peered unabashedly at thetwo droids the eyeball spoke 
 tee chuta hhat yudd 
 threepio stood erect proud though his circuits quivered a bit he faced the to artoo and then to himself artoo detoowha bo seethreepoiosha eytoota odd mischka jabba du hutt 
 the eye looked quickly from one robot to the other then retracted back throughthe little window and slammed the hatch shut 
 ganoong whispered artoo with concern 
 threepio nodded i think going to let us in artoo bettergo he turned to leave as artoo beeped a reluctant 
 at that a horrific grinding screech erupted and the massive iron door slowlybegan to rise the two droids looked at each other skeptically and then into theyawning black cavity that faced them they waited afraid to enter afraid to retreat

 artoo beeped and rolled forward into the gloom threepio hesitated thenrushed after his stubby companion with a start artoo wait for me they stoppedtogether in a gaping passageway as threepio scolded get lost 
 the great door slammed shut behind them with a monumental crash that echoedthrough the dark cavern for a moment the two frightened robots stood therewithout moving then haltingly they stepped forward 
 they were immediately joined by three large gamorrean brutes whose racial hatred of robots was well known the guards usheredthe two droids down the dark corridor without so much as a nod when they reachedthe first hallway one of them grunted an order artoo beeped a nervousquery at threepio 
 you want to know the golden droid responded apprehensively justdeliver master message and get us out of here quick 
 before they could take another step a form approached them from the obscurityof a bib fortuna the inelegant of degeneratecourt he was a tall humanoid creature with eyes that saw only what was a robot that hid all protruding from the back of his skull were two appendages that exhibited prehensile sensual and cognitive functions atvarious he wore either draped over his shoulders for decorative effector when the situation called for balance hanging straight down behind him as if theywere twin tails 
 he smiled thinly as he stopped before the two robots die wanna wanga 
 threepio spoke up officially die wanna wanga we bring a message to yourmaster jabba the hutt artoo beeped a postscript upon which threepio noddedand added and a gift he thought about this a moment looked as puzzled as itwas possible for a droid to look and whispered loudly to artoo gift what gift

 artoo let out a long plaintive cry as threepio was removed then he turned toninedenine and beeped in outrage and at length 
 ninedenine laughed a feisty little one but soon learn somerespect i have need for you on the sail barge several of our astrodroidshave been disappearing for spare parts most likely i think in nicely 
 the droid on the torture rack emitted a wail then sparked brieflyand was silent 
 the court of jabba the hutt roiled in malignant ecstasy oola the beautifulcreature chained to jabba danced in the center of the floor as the inebriated monsterscheered and heckled threepio hovered warily near the back of the throne trying tokeep the lowest profile possible periodically he had to duck to avoid a fruit hurledin his direction or to sidestep a rolling body mostly he just stayed low what elsewas a protocol droid to do in a place of so little protocol 
 jabba leered through the smoke of his hooka and beckoned the creature oola tocome sit beside him she stopped dancing instantly a fearful look in her eye andbacked up shaking her head apparently she had suffered such invitations before 
 jabba became angry he pointed unmistakably to a spot beside him on the eitha he growled 
 oola shook her head more violently her face a mask of terror na chubanegatorie na na natoota 
 jabba became livid furiously he motioned to oola boscka 
 jabba pushed a button as he released chain before she could flee agrating trap door in the floor dropped open and she tumbled into the pit below thedoor snapped shut instantly a moment of silence followed by a low rumbling by a terrified shriek was followed once more by silence 
 jabba laughed until he slobbered a dozen revelers hurried over to peerthrough the grate to observe the demise of the nubile dancer 
 threepio shrank even lower and looked for support to the carbonite form of hansolo suspended in bas relief above the floor now there was a human without asense of protocol thought threepio wistfully 
 his reverie was interrupted by an unnatural quiet that suddenly fell over theroom he looked up to see bib fortuna making his way through the by two gamorrean guards and followed by a bounty hunter who led his captive prize on a leash wookiee 
 threepio gasped stunned oh no chewbacca the future was lookingvery bleak indeed 
 bib muttered a few words into ear pointing to the bounty hunter and hiscaptive jabba listened intently the bounty hunter was humanoid small and belt of cartridges was slung across his jerkin and an in his gavethe impression of his being able to see through things he bowed low then spoke influent ubese greeting majestic one i am boushh it was a metalliclanguage to the rarefied atmosphere of the home planet from which thisnomadic species arose 
 jabba answered in the same tongue though his ubese was stilted and slow atlast someone has brought me the mighty chewbacca he tried to continue butstuttered on the word he wanted with a roaring laugh he turned toward my talkdroid he boomed motioning threepio to come the courtly robot obeyed 
 jabba ordered him congenially welcome our mercenary friend and ask hisprice for the wookiee 
 threepio translated the message to the bounty hunter boushh listened studying the feral creatures around the room possible exits possiblehostages vulnerable points he particularly noticed boba near mercenary who had caught han solo 
 boushh assessed this all in a moment then spoke evenly in his nativetongue to threepio i will take fifty thousand no less 
 threepio quietly translated for jabba who immediately became enraged andknocked the golden droid off the raised throne with a sweep of his massive clattered in a heap on the floor where he rested momentarily uncertain ofthe correct protocol in this situation 
 jabba raved on in guttural huttese boushh shifted his weapon to a more usableposition threepio sighed struggled back onto the throne composed himself andtranslated for jabba was saying 
 thousand is all pay threepio instructed 
 jabba motioned his pig guards to take chewbacca as two jawas covered fett also raised his weapon jabba added to translation twentyfive thousand plus his life 
 threepio translated the room was silent tense uncertain finally boushhspoke softly to threepio 
 tell that swollen garbage bag have to do better than that or bepicking his smelly hide out of every crack in this room holding a thermaldetonator 
 threepio suddenly focused on the small silver ball boushh held partiallyconcealed in his left hand it could be heard humming a quiet ominous looked nervously at jabba then back at boushh 
 jabba barked at the droid well what did he say 
 threepio cleared his throat your grandness he uhhe 
 out with it droid jabba roared 
 oh dear threepio fretted he inwardly prepared himself for the worst thenspoke to jabba in flawless huttese boushh respectfully disagrees with yourexaltedness and begs you to reconsider the amountor he will release the thermaldetonator he is holding 
 instantly a disturbed murmuring circled in the room everyone backed upseveral feet as if that would help jabba stared at the ball clenched in the hand it was beginning to glow another tense hush came over theonlookers 
 jabba stared malevolently at the bounty hunter for several long seconds a satisfied grin crept over his vast ugly mouth from the bilious pit of hisbelly a laugh rose like gas in a mire this bounty hunter is my kind of and inventive tell him no warn him not to press hisluck 
 threepio felt greatly relieved by this turn of events he translated for studied the bounty hunter closely for his reaction guns were readied 
 then boushh released a switch on the thermal detonator and it went he nodded 
 he agrees threepio said to jabba 
 the crowd cheered jabba relaxed come my friend join our celebration imay find other work for you threepio translated as the party resumed in thedepraved revelry 
 chewbacca growled under his breath as he was led away by the might have cracked their heads just for being so ugly or to remind everyonepresent what a wookiee was made near the door he spotted a familiar behind a of teeth was a human in the uniform of a calrissian chewbacca gave no sign of recognition nor did he resistthe guard who now escorted him from the room 
 lando had managed to infiltrate this nest of maggots earlier to see if itwas possible to free solo from imprisonment done this for severalreasons 
 first because he felt correctly that it was his fault han was in this he wanted to make of course he could do so without gettinghurt blending in here like just one of the pirates was no problem for identity was a way of life with him 
 second he wanted to join forces with buddies at the top of the rebelalliance they were out to beat the empire and he wanted nothing more in his lifenow than to do just that the imperial police had moved in on his action once toooften so this was a grudge match now besides lando liked being part of since they seemed to be right up at the business end of all the action againstthe empire 
 third princess leia had asked him to help and he just never could refuse aprincess asking for help besides you never knew how she might thank you someday 
 finally lando would have bet anything that han simply could not be rescuedfrom this lando just plain resist a bet 
 so he spent his days watching a lot watching and calculating what hedid now as chewie was led watched and then he faded into the stonework 
 the band started playing led by a blue named max flooded the floor the courtiers hooted and brewed their brains a bit more 
 boushh leaned against a column surveying the scene his gaze swept coollyover the court taking in the dancers the smokers the rollers the gamblersuntil itcame to rest squarely on an equally unflappable stare from across the room bobafett was watching him 
 boushh shifted slightly posturing with his weapon cradled like a loving fett remained motionless an arrogant sneer all but visible behind his ominousmask 
 pig guards led chewbacca though the unlit dungeon corridor a tentacle coiledout one of the doors to touch the brooding wookiee 
 rheeaaahhr he screamed and the tentacle shot back into its cell 
 the next door was open before chewie fully realized what was happening hewas hurled forcefully into the cell by all the guards the door slammed shut lockinghim in darkness 
 he raised his head and let out a long pitiful howl that carried through the entiremountain of iron and sand up to the infinitely patient sky 
 the throne room was quiet dark and empty as right filled its littered wine and saliva stained the floor shreds of tattered clothing hung from thefixtures unconscious bodies curled under broken furniture the party was over 
 a dark figure moved silently among the shadows pausing behind a column statue there he made his way stealthily along the perimeter of the room steppingonce over a snoring yak face he never made a sound this was boushh thebounty hunter 
 he reached the curtained alcove beside which the slab that was han solo hungsuspended by a force field on the wall boushh looked around furtively then flippeda switch near the side of the carbonite coffin the humming of the force field wounddown and the heavy monolith slowly lowered to the floor 
 boushh stepped up and studied the frozen face of the space pirate he carbonized cheek curiously as if it were a rare precious stone cold andhard as diamond 
 for a few seconds he examined the controls at the side of the slab then activateda series of switches finally after one last hesitant glance at the living statue beforehim he slid the decarbonization lever into place 
 the casing began to emit in a sound anxiously boushh peered allaround again making certain no one heard slowly the hard shell that was coveringthe contours of face started to melt away soon the coating was gone fromthe entire front of body freeing his upraised long frozen fall slackly to his sides his face relaxed into what looked like nothingso much as a boushh extracted the lifeless body from its casing andlowered it gently to the floor 
 he leaned his gruesome helmet close to face listening closely for signs oflife no breath no pulse with a start eyes suddenly snapped open andhe began to cough boushh steadied him tried to quiet were still guardswho might hear 
 quiet he whispered just relax 
 han squinted up at the dim form above him i was understandably disoriented after having been in suspended animation for sixof this desert period that was to him timeless it had been agrim if for an eternity been trying to draw breath to move toscream every moment in conscious painful now suddenly he wasdumped into a loud black cold pit 
 his senses assaulted him all at once the air bit at his skin with a thousand icyteeth the opacity of his sight was impenetrable wind seemed to rush around his earsat hurricane volumes he feel which way was up the myriad smells filling hisnose made him nauseous he stop salivating all his bones thencame the visions 
 visions from his childhood from his last breakfast from if all the images and memories of his life had been crammed into aballoon and the balloon popped and they all came bursting out now randomly in asingle moment it was nearly overwhelming it was sensory overload or moreprecisely memory overload men had gone mad in these first minutes followingdecarbonization hopelessly utterly ever again to reorganize kind of coherent selective order 
 solo that susceptible he rode the surge of this tide of impressions untilit settled down to a churning backwash submerging the bulk of his memories leavingonly the most recent flotsam to foam on the surface his betrayal by lando once called friend his ailing ship his last view of leia his capture by bobafett the bounty hunter who 
 where was he now what had happened his last image was of boba fettwatching him turn into carbonite was this fett again now come to thaw him formore abuse the air roared in his ears his breathing felt irregular unnatural hebatted his hand in front of his face 
 boushh tried to reassure him free of the carbonite and havehibernation sickness your eyesight will return in time come we must hurry to leave this place 
 reflexively han grabbed the bounty hunter felt at the grated thendrew back i am not going even know where i am he begansweating profusely as his heart once again churned blood and his mind groped foranswers who are you anyway he demanded suspiciously perhaps it was fettafter all 
 the bounty hunter reached up and pulled the helmet away from his headrevealing underneath the beautiful face of princess leia 
 one who loves you she whispered taking his face tenderly in her still glovedhands and kissing him long on the lips

 chapter ii 
 
 coming shouted the signaler at that moment 
 the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless 
 shouted the regimental commander in a voice which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome for the approaching chief 
 along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high light blue viennese caleche slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot behind the caleche galloped the suite and a convoy of croats beside kutuzov sat an austrian general in a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the caleche stopped in front of the regiment kutuzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist 
 the word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard the regiment roared health to your ex len len lency and again all became silent at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks 
 from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there were only sick and stragglers everything was in good order except the boots 
 kutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the commander in regarding the regiment behind kutuzov at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was his comrade nesvitski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental back and mimicked his every movement each time the commander started and bent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag 
 kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this involuntarily came closer to him 
 ah timokhin said he recognizing the captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat 
 one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him and so kutuzov who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face 
 another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfied with him he asked the regimental commander 
 and the latter unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass started moved forward and answered highly satisfied your excellency 
 we all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking away from him he used to have a predilection for bacchus 
 the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the captain and his stomach and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutuzov turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face and while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious deferential and innocent expression 
 the third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently trying to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in french 
 you told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov reduced to the ranks in this regiment 
 where is dolokhov asked kutuzov 
 dolokhov who had already changed into a gray greatcoat did not wait to be called the shapely figure of the soldier with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the commander in chief and presented arms 
 have you a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frown 
 this is dolokhov said prince andrew 
 ah said kutuzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your duty the emperor is gracious and i forget you if you deserve well 
 the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private 
 one thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firm ringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia 
 kutuzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from captain timokhin again flitted over his face he turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to the carriage 
 the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed quarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches 
 you bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said the regimental commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front the regimental face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight in the service it be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am the first to apologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out his hand to the captain 
 mention it general as if be so bold replied the captain his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at ismail 
 and tell mr dolokhov that i forget him he may be quite easy and tell me please been meaning to ask how is to ask how is he behaving himself and in general 
 as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellency but his character said timokhin 
 and what about his character asked the regimental commander 
 different on different days answered the captain one day he is sensible well educated and and the next a wild beast in poland if you please he nearly killed a jew 
 oh well well remarked the regimental commander still one must have pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has important connections well then you just 
 i will your excellency said timokhin showing by his smile that he understood his wish 
 well of course of course 
 the regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and reining in his horse said to him 
 after the next affair epaulettes 
 dolokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking smile on his lips change 
 well all right continued the regimental commander a cup of vodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers could hear i thank you all god be praised and he rode past that company and overtook the next one 
 well really a good fellow one can serve under him said timokhin to the subaltern beside him 
 in a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts 
 the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could be heard on every side 
 and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye 
 and so he is quite blind 
 no friend he is than you are boots and leg bands he noticed everything 
 when he looked at my feet friend well thinks i 
 and that other one with him the austrian looked as if he were smeared with chalk as white as flour i suppose they polish him up as they do the guns 
 i say fedeshon did he say when the battles are to begin you were near him everybody said that buonaparte himself was at braunau 
 buonaparte himself just listen to the fool what he know the prussians are up in arms now the austrians you see are putting them down when been put down the war with buonaparte will begin and he says buonaparte is in braunau shows a fool better listen more carefully 
 what devils these quartermasters are see the fifth company is turning into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters 
 give me a biscuit you devil 
 and did you give me tobacco yesterday just it friend ah well never mind here you are 
 they might call a halt here or have to do another four miles without eating 
 it fine when those germans gave us lifts you just sit still and are drawn along 
 and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all seemed to be poles all under the russian crown but here all regular germans 
 singers to the front came the order 
 and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing his arm began a soldiers song commencing with the words morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on then brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the only change being that the words father kamenski were replaced by father kutuzov 
 having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground the drummer a lean handsome soldier of forty looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it down and began 
 oh my bower oh my bower 
 oh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet player in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front and walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with long steps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town the commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company the hussar cornet of suite who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode up to dolokhov 
 hussar cornet zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged to the wild set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend 
 my dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making his horse keep pace with the company 
 how am i dolokhov answered coldly i am as you see 
 the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of reply 
 and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkov 
 all right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the staff 
 i was attached on duty 
 both were silent 
 she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song 
 is it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhov 
 the devil only knows they say so 
 glad answered dolokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded 
 i say come round some evening and have a game of faro said zherkov 
 why have you too much money 
 do come 
 i sworn not to i drink and play till i get reinstated 
 well only till the first engagement 
 we shall see 
 they were again silent 
 come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff 
 dolokhov smiled trouble if i want anything i beg take it 
 well never mind i only 
 and i only 
 
 good health 
 a long long way 
 to my native land 
 zherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song

 and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing his arm began a soldiers song commencing with the words morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on then brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the only change being that the words father kamenski were replaced by father kutuzov 
 having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground the drummer a lean handsome soldier of forty looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it down and began 
 oh my bower oh my bower 
 oh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet player in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front and walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with long steps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town the commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company the hussar cornet of suite who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode up to dolokhov 
 hussar cornet zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged to the wild set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend 
 my dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making his horse keep pace with the company 
 how am i dolokhov answered coldly i am as you see 
 the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of reply 
 and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkov 
 all right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the staff 
 i was attached on duty 
 both were silent 
 she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song 
 is it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhov 
 the devil only knows they say so 
 glad answered dolokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded 
 i say come round some evening and have a game of faro said zherkov 
 why have you too much money 
 do come 
 i sworn not to i drink and play till i get reinstated 
 well only till the first engagement 
 we shall see 
 they were again silent 
 come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff 
 dolokhov smiled trouble if i want anything i beg take it 
 well never mind i only 
 and i only 
 
 good health 
 a long long way 
 to my native land 
 zherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song

 chapter 
 
 i have paid a visit to the heights but i have not seen her since she left joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her and let me pass he said mrs linton was thrang and the master was not in zillah has told me something of the way they go on otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living she thinks catherine haughty and does not like her i can guess by her talk my young lady asked some aid of her when she first came but mr heathcliff told her to follow her own business and let his look after herself and zillah willingly acquiesced being a selfish woman catherine evinced a annoyance at this neglect repaid it with contempt and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies as securely as if she had done her some great wrong i had a long talk with zillah about six weeks ago a little before you came one day when we foregathered on the moor and this is what she told me 
 the first thing mrs linton did she said on her arrival at the heights was to run upstairs without even wishing good evening to me and joseph she shut herself into room and remained till morning then while the master and earnshaw were at breakfast she entered the house and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for her cousin was very ill 
 we know that answered heathcliff but his life is not worth a farthing and i spend a farthing on him 
 but i cannot tell how to do she said and if nobody will help me die 
 walk out of the room cried the master and let me never hear a word more about him none here care what becomes of him if you do act the nurse if you do not lock him up and leave him 
 then she began to bother me and i said had enough plague with the tiresome thing we each had our tasks and hers was to wait on linton mr heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her 
 how they managed together i tell i fancy he fretted a great deal and moaned hisseln night and day and she had precious little rest one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like and looked as if she would fain beg assistance but i was not going to disobey the master i never dare disobey him mrs dean and though i thought it wrong that kenneth should not be sent for it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain and i always refused to meddle once or twice after we had gone to bed happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs top and then shut myself in quick for fear of being moved to interfere i did pity her then sure still i wish to lose my place you know 
 at last one night she came boldly into my chamber and frightened me out of my wits by saying 
 tell mr heathcliff that his son is sure he is this time get up instantly and tell him 
 having uttered this speech she vanished again i lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling nothing house was quiet 
 mistaken i said to myself got over it i disturb them and i began to doze but my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the only bell we have put up on purpose for linton and the master called to me to see what was the matter and inform them that he have that noise repeated 
 i delivered message he cursed to himself and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle and proceeded to their room i followed mrs heathcliff was seated by the bedside with her hands folded on her knees her went up held the light to face looked at him and touched him afterwards he turned to her 
 he said how do you feel she was dumb how do you feel catherine he repeated 
 safe and free she answered i should feel she continued with a bitterness she conceal you have left me so long to struggle against death alone that i feel and see only death i feel like death 
 and she looked like it too i gave her a little wine hareton and joseph who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet and heard our talk from outside now entered joseph was fain i believe of the removal hareton seemed a thought bothered though he was more taken up with staring at catherine than thinking of linton but the master bid him get off to bed again we want his help he afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber and told me to return to mine and mrs heathcliff remained by herself 
 in the morning he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast she had undressed and appeared going to sleep and said she was ill at which i hardly wondered i informed mr heathcliff and he replied 
 well let her be till after the funeral and go up now and then to get her what is needful and as soon as she seems better tell me 
 cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight according to zillah who visited her twice a day and would have been rather more friendly but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled 
 heathcliff went up once to show her will he had bequeathed the whole of his and what had been her movable property to his father the poor creature was threatened or coaxed into that act during her absence when his uncle died the lands being a minor he could not meddle with however mr heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his right and his also i suppose legally at any rate catherine destitute of cash and friends cannot disturb his possession 
 nobody said zillah ever approached her door except that once but i and nobody asked anything about her the first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a sunday afternoon she had cried out when i carried up her dinner that she bear any longer being in the cold and i told her the master was going to thrushcross grange and earnshaw and i hinder her from descending so as soon as she heard horse trot off she made her appearance donned in black and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a quaker she comb them out 
 joseph and i generally go to chapel on sundays the kirk you know has no minister now explained mrs dean and they call the methodists or baptists place i say which it is at gimmerton a chapel joseph had gone she continued but i thought proper to bide at home young folks are always the better for an overlooking and hareton with all his bashfulness a model of nice behaviour i let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us and she had been always used to see the sabbath respected so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone while she stayed he coloured up at the news and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes the and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute i saw he meant to give her his company and i guessed by his way he wanted to be presentable so laughing as i durst not laugh when the master is by i offered to help him if he would and joked at his confusion he grew sullen and began to swear 
 now mrs dean zillah went on seeing me not pleased by her manner you happen think your young lady too fine for mr hareton and happen right but i own i should love well to bring her pride a peg lower and what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her now as poor as you or i poorer be bound saving and doing my little all that allowed zillah to give him her aid and she flattered him into a good humour so when catherine came half forgetting her former insults he tried to make himself agreeable by the account 
 missis walked in she said as chill as an icicle and as high as a princess i got up and offered her my seat in the armchair no she turned up her nose at my civility earnshaw rose too and bid her come to the settle and sit close by the fire he was sure she was starved 
 been starved a month and more she answered resting on the word as scornful as she could 
 and she got a chair for herself and placed it at a distance from both of us having sat till she was warm she began to look round and discovered a number of books in the dresser she was instantly upon her feet again stretching to reach them but they were too high up her cousin after watching her endeavours a while at last summoned courage to help her she held her frock and he filled it with the first that came to hand 
 that was a great advance for the lad she thank him still he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance and ventured to stand behind as she examined them and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book she continued reading or seeking for something to read his attention became by degrees quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls her face he see and she see him and perhaps not quite awake to what he did but attracted like a child to a candle at last he proceeded from staring to touching he put out his hand and stroked one curl as gently as if it were a bird he might have stuck a knife into her neck she started round in such a taking 
 get away this moment how dare you touch me why are you stopping there she cried in a tone of disgust i endure you go upstairs again if you come near me 
 mr hareton recoiled looking as foolish as he could do he sat down in the settle very quiet and she continued turning over her volumes another finally earnshaw crossed over and whispered to me 
 will you ask her to read to us zillah stalled of doing naught and i do could like to hear her dunnot say i wanted it but ask of yourseln 
 mr hareton wishes you would read to us i said immediately take it very be much obliged 
 she frowned and looking up answered 
 mr hareton and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that i reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer i despise you and will have nothing to say to any of you when i would have given my life for one kind word even to see one of your faces you all kept off but i complain to you driven down here by the cold not either to amuse you or enjoy your society 
 what could i ha done began earnshaw how was i to blame 
 oh you are an exception answered mrs heathcliff i never missed such a concern as you 
 but i offered more than once and asked he said kindling up at her pertness i asked mr heathcliff to let me wake for you be silent go out of doors or anywhere rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear said my lady 
 hareton muttered she might go to hell for him and unslinging his gun restrained himself from his sunday occupations no longer he talked now freely enough and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude but the frost had set in and in spite of her pride she was forced to condescend to our company more and more however i took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature ever since been as stiff as herself and she has no lover or liker among us and she does not deserve one for let them say the least word to her and curl back without respect of anyone snap at the master himself and as good as dares him to thrash her and the more hurt she gets the more venomous she grows 
 at first on hearing this account from zillah i determined to leave my situation take a cottage and get catherine to come and live with me but mr heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up hareton in an independent house and i can see no remedy at present unless she could marry again and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange 
 thus ended mrs story notwithstanding the prophecy i am rapidly recovering strength and though it be only the second week in january i propose getting out on horseback in a day or two and riding over to wuthering heights to inform my landlord that i shall spend the next six months in london and if he likes he may look out for another tenant to take the place after october i would not pass another winter here for much

 chapter thirty 
 
 
 mrs fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table and everyone was much interest in the matter amy was asked but jo was not which was fortunate for all parties as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily the haughty uninteresting creature was let severely alone but talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it 
 everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid when some women old and young with all their private piques and prejudices try to work together 
 may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling dainty work entirely eclipsed painted was one thorn then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with was thorn number two but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape no hint of this had reached the culprits however and dismay can be imagined when the very evening before the fair as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table mrs chester who of course resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter said in a bland tone but with a cold look 
 i find dear that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls as this is the most prominent and some say the most attractive table of all and they are the chief of the fair it is thought best for them to take this place sorry but i know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment and you shall have another table if you like 
 mrs chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech but when the time came she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally with unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble 
 amy felt that there was something behind this but would not guess what and said quietly feeling hurt and showing that she did perhaps you had rather i took no table at all 
 now my dear have any ill feeling i beg merely a matter of expediency you see my girls will naturally take the lead and this table is considered their proper place i think it very appropriate to you and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty but we must give up our private wishes of course and i will see that you have a good place elsewhere you like the flower table the little girls undertook it but they are discouraged you could make a charmingthing of it and the flower table is always attractive you know 
 especially to gentlemen added may with a look which enlightened amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor she colored angrily but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm and answered with unexpected amiability 
 it shall be as you please mrs chester give up my place here at once and attend to the flowers if you like 
 you can put your own things on your own table if you prefer began may feeling a little as she looked at the pretty racks the painted shells and quaint illuminations amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged she meant it kindly but amy mistook her meaning and said quickly 
 oh certainly if they are in your way and sweeping her contributions into her apron she walked off feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness 
 now mad oh dear i wish i asked you to speak mama said may looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table 
 girls quarrels are soon over returned her mother feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one as well she might 
 the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit and she fell to work determined to succeed florally if she could not artistically but everything seemed against her it was late and she was tired everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her and the little girls were only hindrances for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order the evergreen arch stay firm after she got it up but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled her best tile got a splash of water which left a sephia tear on the cheek she bruised her hands with hammering and got cold working in a draft which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through her task 
 there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right beth declared she go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her 
 because they are mean is no reason why i should be i hate such things and though i think a right to be hurt i intend to show it they will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions they marmee 
 the right spirit my dear a kiss for a blow is always best though not very easy to give it sometimes said her mother with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing 
 in spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate amy adhered to her resolution all the next day bent on conquering her enemy by kindness she began well thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly but most opportunely as she arranged her table that morning while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets she took up her pet production a little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts as she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 
 i ought but i thought amy as her eye went from the bright page to discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home even a fair table may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always do took the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice 
 a group of girls were standing about table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen they dropped their voices but amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly it was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it she heard may say sorrowfully 
 too bad for there is no time to make other things and i want to fill up with odds and ends the table was just complete then now spoiled 
 i dare say put them back if you asked her suggested someone 
 how could i after all the fuss began may but she did not finish for voice came across the hall saying pleasantly 
 you may have them and welcome without asking if you want them i was just thinking offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine here they are please take them and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night 
 as she spoke amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it 
 now i call that lovely of her you cried one girl 
 answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh very lovely for she knew she sell them at her own table 
 now that was hard when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its won reward but it is as she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skillful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly 
 it was a very long day and a hard one for amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night 
 the art table was the most attractive in the room there was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do it might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom 
 she did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea beth helped her made a charming little wreath for her hair while jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned 
 do anything rude pray jo i have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table 
 i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to ever one i know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible teddy and his boys will lend a hand and have a good time yet returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him 
 is that my boy 
 as sure as this is my girl and laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified 
 oh teddy such doings and jo told wrongs with sisterly zeal 
 a flock of our fellows are going to drive over and be hanged if i make them buy every flower got and camp down before her table afterward said laurie espousing her cause with warmth 
 the flowers are not at all nice amy says and the fresh ones may not arrive in time i wish to be unjust or suspicious but i wonder if they never came at all when people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another observed jo in a disgusted tone 
 hayes give you the best out of our gardens i told him to 
 i know that he forgot i suppose and as your grandpa was poorly i like to worry him by asking though i did want some 
 now jo how could you think there was any need of asking they are just as much yours as mine we always go halves in everything began laurie in the tone that always made jo turn thorny 
 gracious i hope not half of some of your things suit me at all but we stand philandering here got to help amy so you go and make yourself splendid and if be so very kind as to let hayes take a few nice flowers up to the hall bless you forever 
 you do it now asked laurie so suggestively that jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste and called through the bars go away teddy busy 
 thanks to the conspirators the tables were turned that night for hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers with a loverly basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece then the march family turned out en masse and jo exerted herself to some purpose for people not only came but stayed laughing at her nonsense admiring taste and apparently enjoying themselves very much laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach bought up the bouquets encamped before the table and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room amy was in her element now and out of gratitude if nothing more was as spritely and gracious as possible coming to the conclusion about that time that virtue was own reward after all 
 jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety and when amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor jo circulated about the hall picking up various bits of gossip which enlightened her upon the subject of the chester change of base she reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate amy as soon as possible she also discovered what amy had done about the things in the morning and considered her a model of magnanimity as she passed the art table she glanced over it for her things but saw no sign of them tucked away out of sight i dare say thought jo who could forgiver her own wrongs but hotly resented any insult offered her family 
 good evening miss jo how does amy get on asked may with a conciliatory air for she wanted to show that she also could begenerous 
 she has sold everything she had that was worth selling and now she is enjoying herself the flower table is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen 
 jo resist giving that little slap but may took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after and fell to praising the great vases which still remained unsold 
 is illumination anywhere about i took a fancy to buy that for father said jo very anxious to learn the fate of her work 
 everything of sold long ago i took care that the right people saw them and they made a nice little sum of money for us returned may who had overcome sundry small temptations as well as amy had that day 
 much gratified jo rushed back to tell the good news and amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of word and manner 
 now gentlemen i want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine especially the art table she said ordering out own as the girls called the college friends 
 charge chester charge is the motto for that table but do your duty like men and get your worth of art in every sense of the word said the irrepressible jo as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field 
 to hear is to obey but march is fairer far than may said little parker making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender and getting promptly quenched by laurie who said 
 very well my son for a small boy and walked him off with a paternal pat on the head 
 buy the vases whispered amy to laurie as a final heaping of coals of fire on her head 
 to great delight mr laurence not only bought the vases but pervaded the hall with one under each arm the other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles and wandered helplessly about afterward burdened with wax flowers painted fans filigree portfolios and other useful and appropriate purchases 
 aunt carrol was there heard the story looked pleased and said something to mrs march in a corner which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction and watch amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later 
 the fair was pronounced a success and when may bade amy goodnight she did not gush as usual but gave her an affectionate kiss and a look which said forgive and forget that satisfied amy and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each the reward of merit for a magnanimous march as laurie announced with a flourish 
 a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than i ever gave you credit for amy behaved sweetly and i respect you with all my heart said jo warmly as they brushed their hair together late that night 
 yes we all do and love her for being so ready to forgive it must have been dreadfully hard after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things i believe i could have done it as kindly as you did added beth from her pillow 
 why girls you praise me so i only did as be done by you laugh at me when i say i want to be a lady but i mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners and i try to do it as far as i know how i explain exactly but i want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women far from it now but i do my best and hope in time to be what mother is 
 amy spoke earnestly and jo said with a cordial hug i understand now what you mean and never laugh at you again you are getting on faster than you think and take lessons of you in true politeness for learned the secret i believe try away deary get your reward some day and no one will be more delighted than i shall 
 a week later amy did get her reward and poor jo found it hard to be delighted a letter came from aunt carrol and mrs face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that jo and beth who were with her demanded what the glad tiding were 
 aunt carrol is going abroad next month and wants 
 me to go with her burst in jo flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture 
 no dear not you amy 
 oh mother too young my turn first wanted it so long it would do me so much good and be so altogether splendid i must go 
 afraid impossible jo aunt says amy decidedly and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor 
 always so amy has all the fun and i have all the work it fair oh it fair cried jo passionately 
 afraid partly your own fault dear when aunt spoke to me the other day she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit and here she writes as if quoting something you had planned at first to ask jo but as favors burden her and she hates french i think i venture to invite her amy is more docile will make a good companion for flo and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her 
 oh my tongue my abominable tongue why i learn to keep it quiet groaned jo remembering words which had been her undoing when she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases mrs march said sorrowfully 
 i wish you could have gone but there is no hope of it this time so try to bear it cheerfully and sadden pleasure by reproaches or regrets 
 try said jo winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset take a leaf out of her book and try not only to seem glad but to be so and not grudge her one minute of happiness but it be easy for it is a dreadful disappointment and poor jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears jo dear very selfish but i spare you and glad you are not going quite yet whispered beth embracing her basket and all with such a clinging touch and loving face that jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears and humbly beg aunt carrol to burden her with this favor and see how gratefully she would bear it 
 by the time amy came in jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation not quite as heartily as usual perhaps but without repinings at good fortune the young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy went about in a solemn sort of rapture and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening leaving such trifles as clothes money and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself 
 it a mere pleasure trip to me girls she said impressively as she scraped her best palette it will decide my career for if i have any genius i shall find it out in rome and will do something to prove it 
 suppose you said jo sewing away with red eyes at the new collars which were to be handed over to amy 
 then i shall come home and teach drawing for my living replied the aspirant for fame with philosophic composure but she made a wry face at the prospect and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes 
 no you you hate hard work and marry some rich man and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days said jo 
 your predictions sometimes come to pass but i believe that one will sure i wish it would for if i be an artist myself i should like to be able to help those who are said amy smiling as if the part of lady bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher 
 hum said jo with a sigh if you wish it have it for your wishes are always never 
 would you like to go asked amy thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife 
 rather 
 well in a year or two send for you and dig in the forum for relics and carry out all the plans made so many times 
 thank you remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes if it ever does returned jo accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could there was not much time for preparation and the house was in a ferment till amy was off jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished when she retired to her refuge the garret and cried till she cry any more amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best and she clung to laurie the last lingerer saying with a sob 
 oh take care of them for me and if anything should happen 
 i will dear i will and if anything happens come and comfort you whispered laurie little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word 
 so amy sailed away to find the old world which is always new and beautiful to young eyes while her father and friend watched her from the shore fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the girl who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea

 chapter thirty 
 
 
 mrs fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table and everyone was much interest in the matter amy was asked but jo was not which was fortunate for all parties as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily the haughty uninteresting creature was let severely alone but talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it 
 everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid when some women old and young with all their private piques and prejudices try to work together 
 may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling dainty work entirely eclipsed painted was one thorn then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with was thorn number two but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape no hint of this had reached the culprits however and dismay can be imagined when the very evening before the fair as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table mrs chester who of course resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter said in a bland tone but with a cold look 
 i find dear that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls as this is the most prominent and some say the most attractive table of all and they are the chief of the fair it is thought best for them to take this place sorry but i know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment and you shall have another table if you like 
 mrs chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech but when the time came she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally with unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble 
 amy felt that there was something behind this but would not guess what and said quietly feeling hurt and showing that she did perhaps you had rather i took no table at all 
 now my dear have any ill feeling i beg merely a matter of expediency you see my girls will naturally take the lead and this table is considered their proper place i think it very appropriate to you and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty but we must give up our private wishes of course and i will see that you have a good place elsewhere you like the flower table the little girls undertook it but they are discouraged you could make a charmingthing of it and the flower table is always attractive you know 
 especially to gentlemen added may with a look which enlightened amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor she colored angrily but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm and answered with unexpected amiability 
 it shall be as you please mrs chester give up my place here at once and attend to the flowers if you like 
 you can put your own things on your own table if you prefer began may feeling a little as she looked at the pretty racks the painted shells and quaint illuminations amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged she meant it kindly but amy mistook her meaning and said quickly 
 oh certainly if they are in your way and sweeping her contributions into her apron she walked off feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness 
 now mad oh dear i wish i asked you to speak mama said may looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table 
 girls quarrels are soon over returned her mother feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one as well she might 
 the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit and she fell to work determined to succeed florally if she could not artistically but everything seemed against her it was late and she was tired everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her and the little girls were only hindrances for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order the evergreen arch stay firm after she got it up but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled her best tile got a splash of water which left a sephia tear on the cheek she bruised her hands with hammering and got cold working in a draft which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through her task 
 there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right beth declared she go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her 
 because they are mean is no reason why i should be i hate such things and though i think a right to be hurt i intend to show it they will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions they marmee 
 the right spirit my dear a kiss for a blow is always best though not very easy to give it sometimes said her mother with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing 
 in spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate amy adhered to her resolution all the next day bent on conquering her enemy by kindness she began well thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly but most opportunely as she arranged her table that morning while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets she took up her pet production a little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts as she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 
 i ought but i thought amy as her eye went from the bright page to discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home even a fair table may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always do took the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice 
 a group of girls were standing about table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen they dropped their voices but amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly it was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it she heard may say sorrowfully 
 too bad for there is no time to make other things and i want to fill up with odds and ends the table was just complete then now spoiled 
 i dare say put them back if you asked her suggested someone 
 how could i after all the fuss began may but she did not finish for voice came across the hall saying pleasantly 
 you may have them and welcome without asking if you want them i was just thinking offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine here they are please take them and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night 
 as she spoke amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it 
 now i call that lovely of her you cried one girl 
 answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh very lovely for she knew she sell them at her own table 
 now that was hard when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its won reward but it is as she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skillful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly 
 it was a very long day and a hard one for amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night 
 the art table was the most attractive in the room there was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do it might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom 
 she did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea beth helped her made a charming little wreath for her hair while jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned 
 do anything rude pray jo i have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table 
 i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to ever one i know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible teddy and his boys will lend a hand and have a good time yet returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him

lionfish nov chapter thirty the pensievecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the door of the office opened 
 
 hello potter said moody come in then 
 
 harry walked inside he had been inside office once before it was a very beautiful circular room lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts all of whom were fast asleep their chests rising and falling gently 
 
 cornelius fudge was standing beside desk wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his bowler hat 
 
 harry said fudge jovially moving forward how are you 
 
 fine harry lied 
 
 we were just talking about the night when mr crouch turned up on the grounds said fudge it was you who found him was it not 
 
 yes said harry then feeling it was pointless to pretend that he overheard what they had been saying he added i see madame maxime anywhere though and have a job hiding she 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry behind back his eyes twinkling 
 
 yes well said fudge looking embarrassed about to go for a short walk on the grounds harry if excuse usperhaps if you just go back to your class 
 
 i wanted to talk to you professor harry said quickly looking at dumbledore who gave him a swift searching look 
 
 wait here for me harry he said our examination of the grounds will not take long 
 
 they trooped out in silence past him and closed the door after a minute or so harry heard the clunks of wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below he looked around 
 
 hello fawkes he said 
 
 fawkes professor phoenix was standing on his golden perch beside the door the size of a swan with magnificent plumage he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at harry 
 
 harry sat down in a chair in front of desk for several minutes he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames thinking about what he had just heard and running his fingers over his scar it had stopped hurting now 
 
 he felt much calmer somehow now that he was in office knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream harry looked up at the walls behind the desk the patched and ragged sorting hat was standing on a shelf a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt which harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year the sword had once belonged to godric gryffindor founder of house he was gazing at it remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost when he noticed a patch of silvery light dancing and shimmering on the glass case he looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him whose door had not been closed properly harry hesitated glanced at fawkes then got up walked across the office and pulled open the cabinet door 
 
 a shallow stone basin lay there with odd carvings around the edge runes and symbols that harry did not recognize the silvery light was coming from the contents which were like nothing harry had ever seen before he could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas it was a bright whitish silver and it was moving ceaselessly the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind and then like clouds separated and swirled smoothly it looked like light made liquid or like wind made solid harry make up his mind 
 
 he wanted to touch it to find out what it felt like but nearly four years experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do he therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes cast a nervous look around the office looked back at the contents of the basin and prodded them 
 
 the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast 
 
 harry bent closer his head right inside the cabinet the silvery substance had become transparent it looked like glass he looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling 
 
 the room was dimly lit he thought it might even be underground for there were no windows merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of hogwarts lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels an empty chair stood in the very center of the room there was something about the chair that gave harry an ominous feeling chains encircled the arms of it as though its occupants were usually tied to it 
 
 where was this place it surely hogwarts he had never seen a room like that here in the castle moreover the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at hogwarts they seemed he thought to be waiting for something even though he could only see the tops of their hats all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction and none of them were talking to one another 
 
 the basin being circular and the room he was observing square harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it he leaned even closer tilting his head trying to see 
 
 the tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring 
 
 office gave an almighty lurch harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin 
 
 but his head did not hit the stone bottom he was falling through something and black it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool 
 
 and suddenly harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin a bench raised high above the others he looked up at the high stone ceiling expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring but there was nothing there but dark solid stone 
 
 breathing hard and fast harry looked around him not one of the witches and wizards in the room and there were at least two hundred of them was looking at him not one of them seemed to have noticed that a boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room 
 
 he was sitting right next to albus dumbledore 
 
 professor harry said in a kind of strangled whisper sorry i mean to i was just looking at that basin in your cabinet i where are we 
 
 but dumbledore move or speak he ignored harry completely like every other wizard on the benches he was staring into the far corner of the room where there was a door 
 
 harry gazed nonplussed at dumbledore then around at the silently watchful crowd then back at dumbledore and then it dawned on him 
 
 once before harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him that time he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary right into somebody memoryand unless he was very much mistaken something of the sort had happened again 
 
 harry raised his right hand hesitated and then waved it energetically in from of face dumbledore did not blink look around at harry or indeed move at all and that in opinion settled the matter dumbledore ignore him like that he was inside a memory and this was not the dumbledore yet it be that long agothe dumbledore sitting next to him now was just like the dumbledore but what was this place what were all these wizards waiting for 
 
 harry looked around more carefully the room as he had suspected when observing it from above was almost certainly underground more of a dungeon than a room he thought there was a bleak and forbidding air about the place there were no pictures on the walls no decorations at all just these serried rows of benches rising in levels all around the room all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms 
 
 before harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were he heard footsteps the door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered or at least one man flanked by two dementors 
 
 insides went cold the dementors tall hooded creatures whose faces were concealed were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room each grasping one of the arms with their dead and hands the man between them looked as though he was about to faint and harry blame himhe knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory but he remembered their power only too well the watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room the door swung shut behind them 
 
 harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was karkaroff 
 
 unlike dumbledore karkaroff looked much younger his hair and goatee were black he was not dressed in sleek furs but in thin and ragged robes he was shaking even as harry watched the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up arms binding him there 
 
 igor karkaroff said a curt voice to left harry looked around and saw mr crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him hair was dark his face was much less lined he looked fit and alert you have been brought from azkaban to present evidence to the ministry of magic you have given us to understand that you have important information for us 
 
 karkaroff straightened himself as best he could tightly bound to the chair 
 
 i have sir he said and although his voice was very scared harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it i wish to be of use to the ministry i wish to help i i know that the ministry is trying to to round up the last of the dark lords supporters i am eager to assist in any way i can 
 
 there was a murmur around the benches some of the wizards and witches were surveying karkaroff with interest others with pronounced mistrust then harry heard quite distinctly from dumbledores other side a familiar growling voice saying filth 
 
 harry leaned forward so that he could see past dumbledore moody was sitting there except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance he did not have his magical eye but two normal ones both were looking down upon karkaroff and both were narrowed in intense dislike 
 
 crouch is going to let him out moody breathed quietly to dumbledore done a deal with him took me six months to track him down and crouch is going to let him go if got enough new names hear his information i say and throw him straight back to the dementors 
 
 dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long crooked nose 
 
 ah i was forgettingyou like the dementors do you albus said moody with a sardonic smile 
 
 no said dumbledore calmly afraid i i have long felt the ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures 
 
 but for filth like this moody said softly 
 
 you say you have names for us karkaroff said mr crouch let us hear them please 
 
 you must understand said karkaroff hurriedly that operated always in the greatest preferred that we i mean to say his supporters and i regret now very deeply that i ever counted myself among them 
 
 get on with it sneered moody 
 
 we never knew the names of every one of our fellows he alone knew exactly who we all were 
 
 which was a wise move it as it prevented someone like you karkaroff from turning all of them in muttered moody 
 
 yet you say you have some names for us said mr crouch 
 
 i i do said karkaroff breathlessly and these were important supporters mark you people i saw with my own eyes doing his bidding i give this information as a sign that i fully and totally renounce him and am filled with a remorse so deep i can barely 
 
 these names are said mr crouch sharply 
 
 karkaroff drew a deep breath 
 
 there was antonin dolohov he said i i saw him torture countless muggles and and of the dark lord 
 
 and helped him do it murmured moody 
 
 we have already apprehended dolohov said crouch he was caught shortly after yourself 
 
 indeed said karkaroff his eyes widening i i am delighted to hear it 
 
 but he look it harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him one of his names was worthless 
 
 any others said crouch coldly 
 
 why yesthere was rosier said karkaroff hurriedly evan rosier 
 
 rosier is dead said crouch he was caught shortly after you were too he preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle 
 
 took a bit of me with him though whispered moody to right harry looked around at him once more and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to dumbledore 
 
 no no more than rosier deserved said karkaroff a real note of panic in his voice now harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the ministry eyes darted toward the door in the corner behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood waiting 
 
 any more said crouch 
 
 yes said karkaroff there was travers he helped murder the mckinnons mulciber he specialized in the imperius curse forced countless people to do horrific things rookwood who was a spy and passed useful information from inside the ministry itself 
 
 harry could tell that this time karkaroff had struck gold the watching crowd was all murmuring together 
 
 rookwood said mr crouch nodding to a witch sitting in front of him who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment augustus rookwood of the department of mysteries 
 
 the very same said karkaroff eagerly i believe he used a network of wizards both inside the ministry and out to collect information 
 
 but travers and mulciber we have said mr crouch very well karkaroff if that is all you will be returned to azkaban while we decide 
 
 not yet cried karkaroff looking quite desperate wait i have more 
 
 harry could see him sweating in the torchlight his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard 
 
 snape he shouted severus snape 
 
 snape has been cleared by this council said crouch disdainfully he has been vouched for by albus dumbledore 
 
 no shouted karkaroff straining at the chains that bound him to the chair i assure you severus snape is a death eater 
 
 dumbledore had gotten to his feet 
 
 i have given evidence already on this matter he said calmly severus snape was indeed a death eater however he rejoined our side before lord downfall and turned spy for us at great personal risk he is now no more a death eater than i am 
 
 harry turned to look at moody he was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind back 
 
 very well karkaroff crouch said coldly you have been of assistance i shall review your case you will return to azkaban in the meantime 
 
 mr voice faded harry looked around the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke everything was fading he could see only his own body all else was swirling darkness 
 
 and then the dungeon returned harry was sitting in a different seat still on the highest bench but now to the left side of mr crouch the atmosphere seemed quite different relaxed even cheerful the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite she had short blonde hair was wearing magenta robes and was sucking the end of an quill it was unmistakably a younger rita skeeter harry looked around dumbledore was sitting beside him again wearing different robes mr crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer understood it was a different memory a different daya different trial 
 
 the door in the corner opened and ludo bagman walked into the room 
 
 this was not however a ludo bagman gone to seed but a ludo bagman who was clearly at the height of his fitness his nose broken now he was tall and lean and muscular bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair but it did not bind him there as it had bound karkaroff and bagman perhaps taking heart from this glanced around at the watching crowd waved at a couple of them and managed a small smile 
 
 ludo bagman you have been brought here in front of the council of magical law to answer charges relating to the activities of the death eaters said mr crouch we have heard the evidence against you and are about to reach our verdict do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment 
 
 harry believe his ears ludo bagman a death eater 
 
 only said bagman smiling awkwardly well i know been a bit of an idiot 
 
 one or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently mr crouch did not appear to share their feelings he was staring down at ludo bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike 
 
 you never spoke a truer word boy someone muttered dryly to dumbledore behind harry he looked around and saw moody sitting there again if i know always been dim have said some of those bludgers had permanently affected his brain 
 
 ludovic bagman you were caught passing information to lord supporters said mr crouch for this i suggest a term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less than 
 
 but there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up shaking their heads and even their fists at mr crouch 
 
 but told you i had no idea bagman called earnestly over the babble his round blue eyes widening none at all old rookwood was a friend of my crossed my mind he was in with i thought i was collecting information for our side and rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the ministry later ononce my quidditch days are over you knowi mean i keep getting hit by bludgers for the rest of my life can i 
 
 there were titters from the crowd 
 
 it will be put to the vote said mr crouch coldly he turned to the side of the dungeon the jury will please raise their handsthose in favor of imprisonment 
 
 harry looked toward the side of the dungeon not one person raised their hand many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap one of the witches on the jury stood up 
 
 yes barked crouch 
 
 just like to congratulate mr bagman on his splendid performance for england in the quidditch match against turkey last saturday the witch said breathlessly 
 
 mr crouch looked furious the dungeon was ringing with applause now bagman got to his feet and bowed beaming 
 
 despicable mr crouch spat at dumbledore sitting down as bagman walked out of the dungeon rookwood get him a job day ludo bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the ministry 
 
 and the dungeon dissolved again when it had returned harry looked around he and dumbledore were still sitting beside mr crouch but the atmosphere could not have been more different there was total silence broken only by the dry sobs of a frail witch in the seat next to mr crouch she was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands 
 
 harry looked up at crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before a nerve was twitching in his temple 
 
 bring them in he said and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon 
 
 the door in the corner opened yet again six dementors entered this time flanking a group of four people harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at mr crouch a few of them whispered to one another 
 
 the dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor there was a thickset man who stared blankly up at crouch a thinner and more man whose eyes were darting around the crowd a woman with thick shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne and a boy in his late teens who looked nothing short of petrified he was shivering his hair all over his face his freckled skin the wispy little witch beside crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat whimpering into her handkerchief 
 
 crouch stood up he looked down upon the four in front of him and there was pure hatred in his face 
 
 you have been brought here before the council of magical law he said clearly so that we may pass judgment on you for a crime so heinous 
 
 father said the boy with the hair fatherplease 
 
 that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court said crouch speaking more loudly drowning out his voice 
 
 we have heard the evidence against you the four of you stand accused of capturing an auror frank longbottom and subjecting him to the cruciatus curse believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master 
 
 father i shrieked the boy in chains below i i swear it father send me back to the dementors 
 
 you are further accused bellowed mr crouch of using the cruciatus curse on frank wife when he would not give you information you planned to restore to power and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong i now ask the jury 
 
 mother screamed the boy below and the wispy little witch beside crouch began to sob rocking backward and forward mother stop him mother i do it it me 
 
 i now ask the jury shouted mr crouch to raise their hands if they believe as i do that these crimes deserve a life sentence in azkaban 
 
 in unison the witches and wizards along the side of the dungeon raised their hands the crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for bagman their faces full of savage triumph the boy began to scream 
 
 no mother no i do it i do it i know send me there let him 
 
 the dementors were gliding back into the room the boys three companions rose quietly from their seats the woman with the eyes looked up at crouch and called the dark lord will rise again crouch throw us into azkaban we will wait he will rise again and will come for us he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters we alone were faithful we alone tried to find him 
 
 but the boy was trying to fight off the dementors even though harry could see their cold draining power starting to affect him the crowd was jeering some of them on their feet as the woman swept out of the dungeon and the boy continued to struggle 
 
 your son he screamed up at crouch your son 
 
 you are no son of mine bellowed mr crouch his eyes bulging suddenly i have no son 
 
 the wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat she had fainted crouch appeared not to have noticed 
 
 take them away crouch roared at the dementors spit flying from his mouth take them away and may they rot there 
 
 father father i involved no no father please 
 
 i think harry it is time to return to my office said a quiet voice in ear 
 
 harry started he looked around then he looked on his other side 
 
 there was an albus dumbledore sitting on his right watching son being dragged away by the dementors and there was an albus dumbledore on his left looking right at him 
 
 come said the dumbledore on his left and he put his hand under elbow harry felt himself rising into the air the dungeon dissolved around him for a moment all was blackness and then he felt as though he had done a somersault suddenly landing flat on his feet in what seemed like the dazzling light of sunlit office the stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him and albus dumbledore was standing beside him 
 
 professor harry gasped i know i i mean the cabinet door was sort of open and 
 
 i quite understand said dumbledore he lifted the basin carried it over to his desk placed it upon the polished top and sat down in the chair behind it he motioned for harry to sit down opposite him 
 
 harry did so staring at the stone basin the contents had returned to their original state swirling and rippling beneath his gaze 
 
 what is it harry asked shakily 
 
 this it is called a pensieve said dumbledore i sometimes find and i am sure you know the feeling that i simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind 
 
 er said harry who truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort 
 
 at these times said dumbledore indicating the stone basin i use the pensieve one simply siphons the excess thoughts from mind pours them into the basin and examines them at leisure it becomes easier to spot patterns and links you understand when they are in this form 
 
 you meanthat your thoughts harry said staring at the swirling white substance in the basin 
 
 certainly said dumbledore let me show you 
 
 dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair near his temple when he took the wand away hair seemed to be clinging to it but then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange substance that filled the pensieve dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin and harry astonished saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the pensieve and swirled it rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of harry saw his own face change smoothly into who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling his voice echoing slightly 
 
 coming toostronger and clearer than ever 
 
 a connection i could have made without assistance dumbledore sighed but never mind he peered over the top of his spectacles at harry who was gaping at face which was continuing to swirl around the bowl i was using the pensieve when mr fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily undoubtedly i did not fasten the cabinet door properly naturally it would have attracted your attention 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 dumbledore shook his head curiosity is not a sin he said but we should exercise caution with our curiosityyes indeed 
 
 frowning slightly he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand instantly a figure rose out of it a plump scowling girl of about sixteen who began to revolve slowly with her feet still in the basin she took no notice whatsoever of harry or professor dumbledore when she spoke her voice echoed as had done as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin he put a hex on me professor dumbledore and i was only teasing him sir i only said seen him kissing florence behind the greenhouses last thursday 
 
 but why bertha said dumbledore sadly looking up at the now silently revolving girl why did you have to follow him in the first place 
 
 bertha harry whispered looking up at her is that was that bertha jorkins 
 
 yes said dumbledore prodding the thoughts in the basin again bertha sank back into them and they became silvery and opaque once more that was bertha as i remember her at school 
 
 the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated face and it struck harry suddenly how very old he was looking he knew of course that dumbledore was getting on in years but somehow he never really thought of dumbledore as an old man 
 
 so harry said dumbledore quietly before you got lost in my thoughts you wanted to tell me something 
 
 yes said harry professor i was in divination just now and er i fell asleep 
 
 he hesitated here wondering if a reprimand was coming but dumbledore merely said quite understandable continue 
 
 well i had a dream said harry a dream about lord voldemort he was torturing wormtailyou know who wormtail 
 
 i do know said dumbledore promptly please continue 
 
 voldemort got a letter from an owl he said something like blunder had been repaired he said someone was dead then he said wormtail be fed to the snake there was a snake beside his chair he said he said be feeding me to it instead then he did the cruciatus curse on wormtail and my scar hurt harry said it woke me up it hurt so badly 
 
 dumbledore merely looked at him 
 
 er all said harry 
 
 i see said dumbledore quietly i see now has your scar hurt at any other time this year excepting the time it woke you up over the summer 
 
 no i how did you know it woke me up over the summer said harry astonished 
 
 you are not only correspondent said dumbledore i have also been in contact with him ever since he left hogwarts last year it was i who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay 
 
 dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk every now and then he placed his wand tip to his temple removed another shining silver thought and added it to the pensieve the thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that harry make out anything clearly it was merely a blur of color 
 
 professor he said quietly after a couple of minutes 
 
 dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at harry 
 
 my apologies he said quietly he sat back down at his desk 
 
 know why my hurting me 
 
 dumbledore looked very intently at harry for a moment and then said i have a theory no more than is my belief that your scar hurts both when lord voldemort is near you and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred 
 
 butwhy 
 
 because you and he are connected by the curse that failed said dumbledore that is no ordinary scar 
 
 so you thinkthat dreamdid it really happen 
 
 it is possible said dumbledore i would say probable harry did you see voldemort 
 
 no said harry just the back of his chair but there have been anything to see would there i mean he got a body has he butbut then how could he have held the wand harry said slowly 
 
 how indeed muttered dumbledore how indeed 
 
 neither dumbledore nor harry spoke for a while dumbledore was gazing across the room and every now and then placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the pensieve 
 
 professor harry said at last do you think getting stronger 
 
 voldemort said dumbledore looking at harry over the pensieve it was the characteristic piercing look dumbledore had given him on other occasions and always made harry feel as though dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even magical eye could not once again harry i can only give you my suspicions 
 
 dumbledore sighed again and he looked older and wearier than ever 
 
 the years of ascent to power he said were marked with disappearances bertha jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where voldemort was certainly known to be last mr crouch too has disappearedwithin these very grounds and there was a third disappearance one which the ministry i regret to say do not consider of any importance for it concerns a muggle his name was frank bryce he lived in the village where father grew up and he has not been seen since last august you see i read the muggle newspapers unlike most of my ministry friends 
 
 dumbledore looked very seriously at harry 
 
 these disappearances seem to me to be linked the ministry disagrees as you may have heard while waiting outside my office 
 
 harry nodded silence fell between them again dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then harry felt as though he ought to go but his curiosity held him in his chair 
 
 professor he said again 
 
 yes harry said dumbledore 
 
 ercould i ask you aboutthat court thing i was inin the pensieve 
 
 you could said dumbledore heavily i attended it many times but some trials come back to me more clearly than othersparticularly now 
 
 you know you know the trial you found me in the one with son they talking about parents 
 
 dumbledore gave harry a very sharp look has neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother he said 
 
 harry shook his head wondering as he did so how he could have failed to ask neville this in almost four years of knowing him 
 
 yes they were talking about parents said dumbledore his father frank was an auror just like professor moody he and his wife were tortured for information about whereabouts after he lost his powers as you heard 
 
 so dead said harry quietly 
 
 no said dumbledore his voice full of a bitterness harry had never heard there before they are insane they are both in st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i believe neville visits them with his grandmother during the holidays they do not recognize him 
 
 harry sat there he had never knownnever in four years bothered to find out 
 
 the longbottoms were very popular said dumbledore the attacks on them came after fall from power just when everyone thought they were safe those attacks caused a wave of fury such as i have never known the ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it unfortunately the longbottoms evidence was given their condition none too reliable 
 
 then mr son might not have been involved said harry slowly 
 
 dumbledore shook his head 
 
 as to that i have no idea 
 
 harry sat in silence once more watching the contents of the pensieve swirl there were two more questions he was burning to askbut they concerned the guilt of living people 
 
 er he said mr bagman 
 
 has never been accused of any dark activity since said dumbledore calmly 
 
 right said harry hastily staring at the contents of the pensieve again which were swirling more slowly now that dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts ander 
 
 but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him 
 
 face was swimming on the surface again dumbledore glanced down into it and then up at harry 
 
 no more has professor snape he said 
 
 harry looked into light blue eyes and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it 
 
 what made you think really stopped supporting voldemort professor 
 
 dumbledore held gaze for a few seconds and then said that harry is a matter between professor snape and myself 
 
 harry knew that the interview was over dumbledore did not look angry yet there was a finality in his tone that told harry it was time to go he stood up and so did dumbledore 
 
 harry he said as harry reached the door please do not speak about parents to anybody else he has the right to let people know when he is ready 
 
 yes professor said harry turning to go 
 
 and 
 
 harry looked back dumbledore was standing over the pensieve his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light looking older than ever he stared at harry for a moment and then said good luck with the third task 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirty the pensievecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the door of the office opened 
 
 hello potter said moody come in then 
 
 harry walked inside he had been inside office once before it was a very beautiful circular room lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts all of whom were fast asleep their chests rising and falling gently 
 
 cornelius fudge was standing beside desk wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his bowler hat 
 
 harry said fudge jovially moving forward how are you 
 
 fine harry lied 
 
 we were just talking about the night when mr crouch turned up on the grounds said fudge it was you who found him was it not 
 
 yes said harry then feeling it was pointless to pretend that he overheard what they had been saying he added i see madame maxime anywhere though and have a job hiding she 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry behind back his eyes twinkling 
 
 yes well said fudge looking embarrassed about to go for a short walk on the grounds harry if excuse usperhaps if you just go back to your class 
 
 i wanted to talk to you professor harry said quickly looking at dumbledore who gave him a swift searching look 
 
 wait here for me harry he said our examination of the grounds will not take long 
 
 they trooped out in silence past him and closed the door after a minute or so harry heard the clunks of wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below he looked around 
 
 hello fawkes he said 
 
 fawkes professor phoenix was standing on his golden perch beside the door the size of a swan with magnificent plumage he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at harry 
 
 harry sat down in a chair in front of desk for several minutes he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames thinking about what he had just heard and running his fingers over his scar it had stopped hurting now 
 
 he felt much calmer somehow now that he was in office knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream harry looked up at the walls behind the desk the patched and ragged sorting hat was standing on a shelf a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt which harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year the sword had once belonged to godric gryffindor founder of house he was gazing at it remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost when he noticed a patch of silvery light dancing and shimmering on the glass case he looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him whose door had not been closed properly harry hesitated glanced at fawkes then got up walked across the office and pulled open the cabinet door 
 
 a shallow stone basin lay there with odd carvings around the edge runes and symbols that harry did not recognize the silvery light was coming from the contents which were like nothing harry had ever seen before he could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas it was a bright whitish silver and it was moving ceaselessly the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind and then like clouds separated and swirled smoothly it looked like light made liquid or like wind made solid harry make up his mind 
 
 he wanted to touch it to find out what it felt like but nearly four years experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do he therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes cast a nervous look around the office looked back at the contents of the basin and prodded them 
 
 the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast 
 
 harry bent closer his head right inside the cabinet the silvery substance had become transparent it looked like glass he looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling 
 
 the room was dimly lit he thought it might even be underground for there were no windows merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of hogwarts lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels an empty chair stood in the very center of the room there was something about the chair that gave harry an ominous feeling chains encircled the arms of it as though its occupants were usually tied to it 
 
 where was this place it surely hogwarts he had never seen a room like that here in the castle moreover the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at hogwarts they seemed he thought to be waiting for something even though he could only see the tops of their hats all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction and none of them were talking to one another 
 
 the basin being circular and the room he was observing square harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it he leaned even closer tilting his head trying to see 
 
 the tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring 
 
 office gave an almighty lurch harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin 
 
 but his head did not hit the stone bottom he was falling through something and black it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool 
 
 and suddenly harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin a bench raised high above the others he looked up at the high stone ceiling expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring but there was nothing there but dark solid stone 
 
 breathing hard and fast harry looked around him not one of the witches and wizards in the room and there were at least two hundred of them was looking at him not one of them seemed to have noticed that a boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room 
 
 he was sitting right next to albus dumbledore 
 
 professor harry said in a kind of strangled whisper sorry i mean to i was just looking at that basin in your cabinet i where are we 
 
 but dumbledore move or speak he ignored harry completely like every other wizard on the benches he was staring into the far corner of the room where there was a door 
 
 harry gazed nonplussed at dumbledore then around at the silently watchful crowd then back at dumbledore and then it dawned on him 
 
 once before harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him that time he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary right into somebody memoryand unless he was very much mistaken something of the sort had happened again 
 
 harry raised his right hand hesitated and then waved it energetically in from of face dumbledore did not blink look around at harry or indeed move at all and that in opinion settled the matter dumbledore ignore him like that he was inside a memory and this was not the dumbledore yet it be that long agothe dumbledore sitting next to him now was just like the dumbledore but what was this place what were all these wizards waiting for 
 
 harry looked around more carefully the room as he had suspected when observing it from above was almost certainly underground more of a dungeon than a room he thought there was a bleak and forbidding air about the place there were no pictures on the walls no decorations at all just these serried rows of benches rising in levels all around the room all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms 
 
 before harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were he heard footsteps the door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered or at least one man flanked by two dementors 
 
 insides went cold the dementors tall hooded creatures whose faces were concealed were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room each grasping one of the arms with their dead and hands the man between them looked as though he was about to faint and harry blame himhe knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory but he remembered their power only too well the watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room the door swung shut behind them 
 
 harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was karkaroff 
 
 unlike dumbledore karkaroff looked much younger his hair and goatee were black he was not dressed in sleek furs but in thin and ragged robes he was shaking even as harry watched the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up arms binding him there 
 
 igor karkaroff said a curt voice to left harry looked around and saw mr crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him hair was dark his face was much less lined he looked fit and alert you have been brought from azkaban to present evidence to the ministry of magic you have given us to understand that you have important information for us 
 
 karkaroff straightened himself as best he could tightly bound to the chair 
 
 i have sir he said and although his voice was very scared harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it i wish to be of use to the ministry i wish to help i i know that the ministry is trying to to round up the last of the dark lords supporters i am eager to assist in any way i can 
 
 there was a murmur around the benches some of the wizards and witches were surveying karkaroff with interest others with pronounced mistrust then harry heard quite distinctly from dumbledores other side a familiar growling voice saying filth 
 
 harry leaned forward so that he could see past dumbledore moody was sitting there except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance he did not have his magical eye but two normal ones both were looking down upon karkaroff and both were narrowed in intense dislike 
 
 crouch is going to let him out moody breathed quietly to dumbledore done a deal with him took me six months to track him down and crouch is going to let him go if got enough new names hear his information i say and throw him straight back to the dementors 
 
 dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long crooked nose 
 
 ah i was forgettingyou like the dementors do you albus said moody with a sardonic smile 
 
 no said dumbledore calmly afraid i i have long felt the ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures 
 
 but for filth like this moody said softly 
 
 you say you have names for us karkaroff said mr crouch let us hear them please 
 
 you must understand said karkaroff hurriedly that operated always in the greatest preferred that we i mean to say his supporters and i regret now very deeply that i ever counted myself among them 
 
 get on with it sneered moody 
 
 we never knew the names of every one of our fellows he alone knew exactly who we all were 
 
 which was a wise move it as it prevented someone like you karkaroff from turning all of them in muttered moody 
 
 yet you say you have some names for us said mr crouch 
 
 i i do said karkaroff breathlessly and these were important supporters mark you people i saw with my own eyes doing his bidding i give this information as a sign that i fully and totally renounce him and am filled with a remorse so deep i can barely 
 
 these names are said mr crouch sharply 
 
 karkaroff drew a deep breath 
 
 there was antonin dolohov he said i i saw him torture countless muggles and and of the dark lord 
 
 and helped him do it murmured moody 
 
 we have already apprehended dolohov said crouch he was caught shortly after yourself 
 
 indeed said karkaroff his eyes widening i i am delighted to hear it 
 
 but he look it harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him one of his names was worthless 
 
 any others said crouch coldly 
 
 why yesthere was rosier said karkaroff hurriedly evan rosier 
 
 rosier is dead said crouch he was caught shortly after you were too he preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle 
 
 took a bit of me with him though whispered moody to right harry looked around at him once more and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to dumbledore 
 
 no no more than rosier deserved said karkaroff a real note of panic in his voice now harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the ministry eyes darted toward the door in the corner behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood waiting 
 
 any more said crouch 
 
 yes said karkaroff there was travers he helped murder the mckinnons mulciber he specialized in the imperius curse forced countless people to do horrific things rookwood who was a spy and passed useful information from inside the ministry itself 
 
 harry could tell that this time karkaroff had struck gold the watching crowd was all murmuring together 
 
 rookwood said mr crouch nodding to a witch sitting in front of him who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment augustus rookwood of the department of mysteries 
 
 the very same said karkaroff eagerly i believe he used a network of wizards both inside the ministry and out to collect information 
 
 but travers and mulciber we have said mr crouch very well karkaroff if that is all you will be returned to azkaban while we decide 
 
 not yet cried karkaroff looking quite desperate wait i have more 
 
 harry could see him sweating in the torchlight his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard 
 
 snape he shouted severus snape 
 
 snape has been cleared by this council said crouch disdainfully he has been vouched for by albus dumbledore 
 
 no shouted karkaroff straining at the chains that bound him to the chair i assure you severus snape is a death eater 
 
 dumbledore had gotten to his feet 
 
 i have given evidence already on this matter he said calmly severus snape was indeed a death eater however he rejoined our side before lord downfall and turned spy for us at great personal risk he is now no more a death eater than i am 
 
 harry turned to look at moody he was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind back 
 
 very well karkaroff crouch said coldly you have been of assistance i shall review your case you will return to azkaban in the meantime 
 
 mr voice faded harry looked around the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke everything was fading he could see only his own body all else was swirling darkness 
 
 and then the dungeon returned harry was sitting in a different seat still on the highest bench but now to the left side of mr crouch the atmosphere seemed quite different relaxed even cheerful the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite she had short blonde hair was wearing magenta robes and was sucking the end of an quill it was unmistakably a younger rita skeeter harry looked around dumbledore was sitting beside him again wearing different robes mr crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer understood it was a different memory a different daya different trial 
 
 the door in the corner opened and ludo bagman walked into the room 
 
 this was not however a ludo bagman gone to seed but a ludo bagman who was clearly at the height of his fitness his nose broken now he was tall and lean and muscular bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair but it did not bind him there as it had bound karkaroff and bagman perhaps taking heart from this glanced around at the watching crowd waved at a couple of them and managed a small smile 
 
 ludo bagman you have been brought here in front of the council of magical law to answer charges relating to the activities of the death eaters said mr crouch we have heard the evidence against you and are about to reach our verdict do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment 
 
 harry believe his ears ludo bagman a death eater 
 
 only said bagman smiling awkwardly well i know been a bit of an idiot 
 
 one or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently mr crouch did not appear to share their feelings he was staring down at ludo bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike 
 
 you never spoke a truer word boy someone muttered dryly to dumbledore behind harry he looked around and saw moody sitting there again if i know always been dim have said some of those bludgers had permanently affected his brain 
 
 ludovic bagman you were caught passing information to lord supporters said mr crouch for this i suggest a term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less than 
 
 but there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up shaking their heads and even their fists at mr crouch 
 
 but told you i had no idea bagman called earnestly over the babble his round blue eyes widening none at all old rookwood was a friend of my crossed my mind he was in with i thought i was collecting information for our side and rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the ministry later ononce my quidditch days are over you knowi mean i keep getting hit by bludgers for the rest of my life can i 
 
 there were titters from the crowd 
 
 it will be put to the vote said mr crouch coldly he turned to the side of the dungeon the jury will please raise their handsthose in favor of imprisonment 
 
 harry looked toward the side of the dungeon not one person raised their hand many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap one of the witches on the jury stood up 
 
 yes barked crouch 
 
 just like to congratulate mr bagman on his splendid performance for england in the quidditch match against turkey last saturday the witch said breathlessly 
 
 mr crouch looked furious the dungeon was ringing with applause now bagman got to his feet and bowed beaming 
 
 despicable mr crouch spat at dumbledore sitting down as bagman walked out of the dungeon rookwood get him a job day ludo bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the ministry 
 
 and the dungeon dissolved again when it had returned harry looked around he and dumbledore were still sitting beside mr crouch but the atmosphere could not have been more different there was total silence broken only by the dry sobs of a frail witch in the seat next to mr crouch she was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands 
 
 harry looked up at crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before a nerve was twitching in his temple 
 
 bring them in he said and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon 
 
 the door in the corner opened yet again six dementors entered this time flanking a group of four people harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at mr crouch a few of them whispered to one another 
 
 the dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor there was a thickset man who stared blankly up at crouch a thinner and more man whose eyes were darting around the crowd a woman with thick shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne and a boy in his late teens who looked nothing short of petrified he was shivering his hair all over his face his freckled skin the wispy little witch beside crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat whimpering into her handkerchief 
 
 crouch stood up he looked down upon the four in front of him and there was pure hatred in his face 
 
 you have been brought here before the council of magical law he said clearly so that we may pass judgment on you for a crime so heinous 
 
 father said the boy with the hair fatherplease 
 
 that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court said crouch speaking more loudly drowning out his voice 
 
 we have heard the evidence against you the four of you stand accused of capturing an auror frank longbottom and subjecting him to the cruciatus curse believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master 
 
 father i shrieked the boy in chains below i i swear it father send me back to the dementors 
 
 you are further accused bellowed mr crouch of using the cruciatus curse on frank wife when he would not give you information you planned to restore to power and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong i now ask the jury 
 
 mother screamed the boy below and the wispy little witch beside crouch began to sob rocking backward and forward mother stop him mother i do it it me 
 
 i now ask the jury shouted mr crouch to raise their hands if they believe as i do that these crimes deserve a life sentence in azkaban 
 
 in unison the witches and wizards along the side of the dungeon raised their hands the crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for bagman their faces full of savage triumph the boy began to scream 
 
 no mother no i do it i do it i know send me there let him 
 
 the dementors were gliding back into the room the boys three companions rose quietly from their seats the woman with the eyes looked up at crouch and called the dark lord will rise again crouch throw us into azkaban we will wait he will rise again and will come for us he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters we alone were faithful we alone tried to find him 
 
 but the boy was trying to fight off the dementors even though harry could see their cold draining power starting to affect him the crowd was jeering some of them on their feet as the woman swept out of the dungeon and the boy continued to struggle 
 
 your son he screamed up at crouch your son 
 
 you are no son of mine bellowed mr crouch his eyes bulging suddenly i have no son 
 
 the wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat she had fainted crouch appeared not to have noticed 
 
 take them away crouch roared at the dementors spit flying from his mouth take them away and may they rot there 
 
 father father i involved no no father please 
 
 i think harry it is time to return to my office said a quiet voice in ear 
 
 harry started he looked around then he looked on his other side 
 
 there was an albus dumbledore sitting on his right watching son being dragged away by the dementors and there was an albus dumbledore on his left looking right at him 
 
 come said the dumbledore on his left and he put his hand under elbow harry felt himself rising into the air the dungeon dissolved around him for a moment all was blackness and then he felt as though he had done a somersault suddenly landing flat on his feet in what seemed like the dazzling light of sunlit office the stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him and albus dumbledore was standing beside him 
 
 professor harry gasped i know i i mean the cabinet door was sort of open and 
 
 i quite understand said dumbledore he lifted the basin carried it over to his desk placed it upon the polished top and sat down in the chair behind it he motioned for harry to sit down opposite him 
 
 harry did so staring at the stone basin the contents had returned to their original state swirling and rippling beneath his gaze 
 
 what is it harry asked shakily 
 
 this it is called a pensieve said dumbledore i sometimes find and i am sure you know the feeling that i simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind 
 
 er said harry who truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort 
 
 at these times said dumbledore indicating the stone basin i use the pensieve one simply siphons the excess thoughts from mind pours them into the basin and examines them at leisure it becomes easier to spot patterns and links you understand when they are in this form 
 
 you meanthat your thoughts harry said staring at the swirling white substance in the basin 
 
 certainly said dumbledore let me show you 
 
 dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair near his temple when he took the wand away hair seemed to be clinging to it but then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange substance that filled the pensieve dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin and harry astonished saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the pensieve and swirled it rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of harry saw his own face change smoothly into who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling his voice echoing slightly 
 
 coming toostronger and clearer than ever 
 
 a connection i could have made without assistance dumbledore sighed but never mind he peered over the top of his spectacles at harry who was gaping at face which was continuing to swirl around the bowl i was using the pensieve when mr fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily undoubtedly i did not fasten the cabinet door properly naturally it would have attracted your attention 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 dumbledore shook his head curiosity is not a sin he said but we should exercise caution with our curiosityyes indeed 
 
 frowning slightly he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand instantly a figure rose out of it a plump scowling girl of about sixteen who began to revolve slowly with her feet still in the basin she took no notice whatsoever of harry or professor dumbledore when she spoke her voice echoed as had done as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin he put a hex on me professor dumbledore and i was only teasing him sir i only said seen him kissing florence behind the greenhouses last thursday 
 
 but why bertha said dumbledore sadly looking up at the now silently revolving girl why did you have to follow him in the first place 
 
 bertha harry whispered looking up at her is that was that bertha jorkins 
 
 yes said dumbledore prodding the thoughts in the basin again bertha sank back into them and they became silvery and opaque once more that was bertha as i remember her at school 
 
 the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated face and it struck harry suddenly how very old he was looking he knew of course that dumbledore was getting on in years but somehow he never really thought of dumbledore as an old man 
 
 so harry said dumbledore quietly before you got lost in my thoughts you wanted to tell me something 
 
 yes said harry professor i was in divination just now and er i fell asleep 
 
 he hesitated here wondering if a reprimand was coming but dumbledore merely said quite understandable continue 
 
 well i had a dream said harry a dream about lord voldemort he was torturing wormtailyou know who wormtail 
 
 i do know said dumbledore promptly please continue 
 
 voldemort got a letter from an owl he said something like blunder had been repaired he said someone was dead then he said wormtail be fed to the snake there was a snake beside his chair he said he said be feeding me to it instead then he did the cruciatus curse on wormtail and my scar hurt harry said it woke me up it hurt so badly 
 
 dumbledore merely looked at him 
 
 er all said harry 
 
 i see said dumbledore quietly i see now has your scar hurt at any other time this year excepting the time it woke you up over the summer 
 
 no i how did you know it woke me up over the summer said harry astonished 
 
 you are not only correspondent said dumbledore i have also been in contact with him ever since he left hogwarts last year it was i who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay 
 
 dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk every now and then he placed his wand tip to his temple removed another shining silver thought and added it to the pensieve the thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that harry make out anything clearly it was merely a blur of color 
 
 professor he said quietly after a couple of minutes 
 
 dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at harry 
 
 my apologies he said quietly he sat back down at his desk 
 
 know why my hurting me 
 
 dumbledore looked very intently at harry for a moment and then said i have a theory no more than is my belief that your scar hurts both when lord voldemort is near you and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred 
 
 butwhy 
 
 because you and he are connected by the curse that failed said dumbledore that is no ordinary scar 
 
 so you thinkthat dreamdid it really happen 
 
 it is possible said dumbledore i would say probable harry did you see voldemort 
 
 no said harry just the back of his chair but there have been anything to see would there i mean he got a body has he butbut then how could he have held the wand harry said slowly 
 
 how indeed muttered dumbledore how indeed 
 
 neither dumbledore nor harry spoke for a while dumbledore was gazing across the room and every now and then placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the pensieve 
 
 professor harry said at last do you think getting stronger 
 
 voldemort said dumbledore looking at harry over the pensieve it was the characteristic piercing look dumbledore had given him on other occasions and always made harry feel as though dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even magical eye could not once again harry i can only give you my suspicions 
 
 dumbledore sighed again and he looked older and wearier than ever 
 
 the years of ascent to power he said were marked with disappearances bertha jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where voldemort was certainly known to be last mr crouch too has disappearedwithin these very grounds and there was a third disappearance one which the ministry i regret to say do not consider of any importance for it concerns a muggle his name was frank bryce he lived in the village where father grew up and he has not been seen since last august you see i read the muggle newspapers unlike most of my ministry friends 
 
 dumbledore looked very seriously at harry 
 
 these disappearances seem to me to be linked the ministry disagrees as you may have heard while waiting outside my office 
 
 harry nodded silence fell between them again dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then harry felt as though he ought to go but his curiosity held him in his chair 
 
 professor he said again 
 
 yes harry said dumbledore 
 
 ercould i ask you aboutthat court thing i was inin the pensieve 
 
 you could said dumbledore heavily i attended it many times but some trials come back to me more clearly than othersparticularly now 
 
 you know you know the trial you found me in the one with son they talking about parents 
 
 dumbledore gave harry a very sharp look has neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother he said 
 
 harry shook his head wondering as he did so how he could have failed to ask neville this in almost four years of knowing him 
 
 yes they were talking about parents said dumbledore his father frank was an auror just like professor moody he and his wife were tortured for information about whereabouts after he lost his powers as you heard 
 
 so dead said harry quietly 
 
 no said dumbledore his voice full of a bitterness harry had never heard there before they are insane they are both in st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i believe neville visits them with his grandmother during the holidays they do not recognize him 
 
 harry sat there he had never knownnever in four years bothered to find out 
 
 the longbottoms were very popular said dumbledore the attacks on them came after fall from power just when everyone thought they were safe those attacks caused a wave of fury such as i have never known the ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it unfortunately the longbottoms evidence was given their condition none too reliable 
 
 then mr son might not have been involved said harry slowly 
 
 dumbledore shook his head 
 
 as to that i have no idea 
 
 harry sat in silence once more watching the contents of the pensieve swirl there were two more questions he was burning to askbut they concerned the guilt of living people 
 
 er he said mr bagman 
 
 has never been accused of any dark activity since said dumbledore calmly 
 
 right said harry hastily staring at the contents of the pensieve again which were swirling more slowly now that dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts ander 
 
 but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him 
 
 face was swimming on the surface again dumbledore glanced down into it and then up at harry 
 
 no more has professor snape he said 
 
 harry looked into light blue eyes and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it 
 
 what made you think really stopped supporting voldemort professor 
 
 dumbledore held gaze for a few seconds and then said that harry is a matter between professor snape and myself 
 
 harry knew that the interview was over dumbledore did not look angry yet there was a finality in his tone that told harry it was time to go he stood up and so did dumbledore 
 
 harry he said as harry reached the door please do not speak about parents to anybody else he has the right to let people know when he is ready 
 
 yes professor said harry turning to go 
 
 and 
 
 harry looked back dumbledore was standing over the pensieve his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light looking older than ever he stared at harry for a moment and then said good luck with the third task 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirty grawpcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the story of fred and flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of legend within a week even those who had been were they had seen the twins umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with dungbombs before zooming out of the doors in the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them harry frequently heard students saying things like honestly some days i just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place or else one more lesson like that and i might just do a weasley 
 
 fred and george had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon for one thing they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing umbridge and filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success eventually the area was roped off and filch gnashing his teeth furiously was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms harry was certain that teachers like mcgonagall or flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but just as in the case of fred and wildfire they seemed to prefer to watch umbridge struggle 
 
 then there were the two large holes in office door through which fred and cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters filch fitted a new door and removed firebolt to the dungeons where it was rumoured umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it however her troubles were far from over 
 
 inspired by fred and example a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of in spite of the new door somebody managed to slip a niffler into office which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects leapt on umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers dungbombs and stink pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform charms on themselves before leaving lessons which ensured them a supply of fresh air even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing goldfish bowls on their heads 
 
 filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands desperate to catch miscreants but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn the inquisitorial squad was attempting to help him but odd things kept happening to its members warrington of the slytherin quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes pansy parkinson to delight missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers 
 
 meanwhile it became clear just how many skiving snackboxes fred and george had managed to sell before leaving hogwarts umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint vomit develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from umbridgeitis after putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding swooning sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves 
 
 but not even the users of the snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos peeves who seemed to have taken parting words deeply to heart cackling madly he soared through the school upending tables bursting out of blackboards toppling statues and vases twice he shut mrs norris inside a suit of armour from which she was rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the great hall during breakfast and whenever he fancied a break spent hours at a time floating along after umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke 
 
 none of the staff but filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her indeed a week after fred and departure harry witnessed professor mcgonagall walking right past peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth it unscrews the other way 
 
 to cap matters montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one tuesday morning striding up the front drive looking extremely angry 
 
 should we say something said hermione in a worried voice pressing her cheek against the charms window so that she could see mr and mrs montague marching inside about what happened to him in case it helps madam pomfrey cure him 
 
 course not recover said ron indifferently 
 
 anyway more trouble for umbridge it said harry in a satisfied voice 
 
 he and ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty trembled for a few seconds then folded causing the cup to crack into two 
 
 reparo said hermione quickly mending cup with a wave of her wand all very well but what if permanently injured 
 
 who cares said ron irritably while his teacup stood up drunkenly again trembling violently at the knees montague have tried to take all those points from gryffindor should he if you want to worry about anyone hermione worry about me 
 
 you she said catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little legs and replacing it in front of her why should i be worried about you 
 
 when next letter finally gets through screening process said ron bitterly now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight going to be in deep trouble i be surprised if sent another howler 
 
 but 
 
 be my fault fred and george left you wait said ron darkly say i stopped them leaving i grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something yeah be all my fault 
 
 well if she say that be very unfair you have done anything but sure she i mean if really true got premises in diagon alley they must have been planning this for ages 
 
 yeah but another thing how did they get premises said ron hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him a bit dodgy it need loads of galleons to afford the rent on a place in diagon alley want to know what been up to to get their hands on that sort of gold 
 
 well yes that occurred to me too said hermione allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop been wondering whether mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful 
 
 he said harry curtly 
 
 how do you know said ron and hermione together 
 
 because harry hesitated but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come there was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that fred and george were criminals because they got the gold from me i gave them my triwizard winnings last june 
 
 there was a shocked silence then teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor 
 
 oh harry you she said 
 
 yes i did said harry mutinously and i regret it either i need the gold and be great at running a joke shop 
 
 but this is excellent said ron looking thrilled all your fault harrymum blame me at all can i tell her 
 
 yeah i suppose better said harry dully specially if she thinks receiving stolen cauldrons or something 
 
 hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson but harry had a shrewd suspicion that her was bound to crack before long sure enough once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak may sunshine she fixed harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air 
 
 harry interrupted her before she had even started 
 
 no good nagging me done he said firmly fred and george have got the gold spent a good bit of it too by the sounds of itand i get it back from them and i want to so save your breath hermione 
 
 i going to say anything about fred and george she said in an injured voice 
 
 ron snorted disbelievingly and hermione threw him a very dirty look 
 
 no i she said angrily as a matter of fact i was going to ask harry when going to go back to snape and ask for more occlumency lessons 
 
 heart sank once they had exhausted the subject of fred and dramatic departure which admittedly had taken many hours ron and hermione had wanted to hear news of sirius as harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to sirius in the first place it had been hard to think of what to tell them he had ended up saying truthfully that sirius wanted harry to resume occlumency lessons he had been regretting this ever since hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when harry least expected it 
 
 you tell me stopped having funny dreams hermione said now because ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night 
 
 harry threw ron a furious look ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself 
 
 you were only muttering a bit he mumbled apologetically something about just a bit further 
 
 i dreamed i was watching you lot play quidditch harry lied brutally i was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the quaffle 
 
 ears went red harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure he had not of course dreamed anything of the sort 
 
 last night he had once again made the journey along the department of mysteries corridor he had passed through the circular room then the room full of clicking and dancing light until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres 
 
 he had hurried straight towards row number turned left and run along it it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud just a bit further for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake and before he had reached the end of the row he had found himself lying in bed again gazing up at the canopy of his 
 
 you are trying to block your mind you said hermione looking beadily at harry you are keeping going with your occlumency 
 
 of course i am said harry trying to sound as though this question was insulting but not quite meeting her eye the truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue 
 
 the problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all and when he did his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams he also suspected that part of his mindthe part that often spoke in voicenow felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door and sought to wake him before he could reach the end 
 
 you know said ron whose ears were still flaming red if montague recover before slytherin play hufflepuff we might be in with a chance of winning the cup 
 
 yeah i so said harry glad of a change of subject 
 
 i mean won one lost oneif slytherin lose to hufflepuff next saturday 
 
 yeah right said harry losing track of what he was agreeing to cho chang had just walked across the courtyard determinedly not looking at him 
 
 the final match of the quidditch season gryffindor versus ravenclaw was to take place on the last weekend of may although slytherin had been narrowly defeated by hufflepuff in their last match gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory due mainly though of course nobody said it to him to abysmal record he however seemed to have found a new optimism 
 
 i mean i get any worse can i he told harry and hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match nothing to lose now is there 
 
 you know said hermione as she and harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd i think ron might do better without fred and george around they never exactly gave him a lot of confidence 
 
 luna lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head 
 
 oh gosh i forgot said hermione watching the eagle flapping its wings as luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing slytherins cho will be playing she 
 
 harry who had not forgotten this merely grunted 
 
 they found seats in the topmost row of the stands it was a fine ckar day ron could not wish for better and harry found himself hoping against hope that ron would not give the slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of weasley is our king 
 
 lee jordan who had been very dispirited since fred and george had left was commentating as usual as the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto 
 
 bradley davies chang he said and harry felt his stomach perform less of a back flip more a feeble lurch as cho walked out on to the pitch her shiny black hair rippling in the slight was not sure what he wanted to happen any more except that he could not stand any more rows even the sight of her chatting animatedly to roger davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy 
 
 and off said lee and davies takes the quaffle immediately ravenclaw captain davies with the quaffle he dodges johnson he dodges bell he dodges spinnet as well going straight for goal going to shootandand lee swore very loudly and scored 
 
 harry and hermione groaned with the rest of the gryffindors predictably horribly the slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 harry said a hoarse voice in ear hermione 
 
 harry looked round and saw enormous bearded face sticking between the seats apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind for the first and he had just passed had a ruffled flattened look about them for some reason hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else 
 
 listen he whispered can yeh come with me now while watchin the match 
 
 er it wait hagrid asked harry till the match is over 
 
 no said hagrid no harry gotta be now while lookin the other way please 
 
 nose was gently dripping blood his eyes were both blackened harry had not seen him this since his return to the school he looked utterly woebegone 
 
 course said harry at once course come 
 
 he and hermione edged back along their row of seats causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them the people in row were not complaining merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible 
 
 i ppreciate this you two i really do said hagrid as they reached the stairs he kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below i jus hope she doesn notice us goin 
 
 you mean umbridge said harry she got her whole inquisitorial squad sitting with her you see she must be expecting trouble at the match 
 
 yeah well a bit o trouble wouldn hurt said hagrid pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted give us more time 
 
 what is it hagrid said hermione looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the forest 
 
 see in a mo said hagrid looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them heydid someone jus score 
 
 be ravenclaw said harry heavily 
 
 good good said hagrid distractedly good 
 
 they had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn looking around with every other step when they reached his cabin hermione turned automatically left towards the front door hagrid however walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree when he realised they were no longer with him he turned 
 
 goin in here he said jerking his shaggy head behind him 
 
 into the forest said hermione perplexed 
 
 yeah said hagrid now quick before spotted 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then ducked into the cover of the trees behind hagrid who was already striding away from them into the green gloom his crossbow over his arm harry and hermione ran to catch up with him 
 
 hagrid why are you armed said harry 
 
 jus a precaution said hagrid shrugging his massive shoulders 
 
 you bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals said hermione timidly 
 
 nah well we weren goin in so far then said hagrid an anyway tha was before firenze left the forest wasn it 
 
 why does firenze leaving make a difference asked hermione curiously 
 
 cause the other centaurs are good an riled at me why said hagrid quietly glancing around they used ter bewell yeh couldn call em friendlybut we got on all righ kept emselves to emselves bu always turned up if i wanted a word not any more 
 
 he sighed deeply 
 
 firenze said angry because he went to work for dumbledore harry said tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching profile 
 
 yeah said hagrid heavily well angry doesn cover it ruddy livid if i hadn stepped in i reckon kicked firenze ter death 
 
 they attacked him said hermione sounding shocked 
 
 yep said hagrid gruffly forcing his way through several branches he had half the herd on to him 
 
 and you stopped it said harry amazed and impressed by yourself 
 
 course i did stand by an watch em kill im could i said hagrid lucky i was passin really an thought firenze mighta remembered tha before he started sendin me stupid he added hotly and unexpectedly 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other startled but hagrid scowling did not elaborate 
 
 anyway he said breathing a little more heavily than usud since then the other bin livid with me an the trouble is got a lot of influence in the forest cleverest creatures in here 
 
 is that why here hagrid asked hermione the centaurs 
 
 ah no said hagrid shaking his head dismissively no not them well o course they could complicate the problem yeah but see what i mean in a bit 
 
 on this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead taking one stride for every three of theirs so that they had great trouble keeping up with him 
 
 the path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the forest that it was as dark as dusk they were soon a long way past the clearing where hagrid had shown them the thestrals but harry felt no sense of unease until hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the forest 
 
 hagrid said harry fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles over which hagrid had stepped with ease and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the forest path where are we going 
 
 bit further said hagrid over his shoulder harry we need ter keep together now 
 
 it was a great struggle to keep up with hagrid what with branches and thickets of thorn through which hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs but which snagged harry and robes frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches they were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all harry could see of hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence the breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow caused harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit it occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him as rather ominous 
 
 hagrid would it be all right if we lit our wands said hermione quietly 
 
 er all righ hagrid whispered back in fact 
 
 he stopped suddenly and turned around hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor 
 
 maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen so i can fill yeh in said hagrid before we ge there like 
 
 good said hermione as harry set her back on her feet they both murmured lumos and their ignited face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad 
 
 righ said hagrid well see the thing is 
 
 he took a great breath 
 
 well a good chance goin ter be gettin the sack any day now he said 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then back at him 
 
 but lasted this long hermione said tentatively what makes you think 
 
 umbridge reckons it was me that put tha niffler in her office 
 
 and was it said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 no it ruddy well wasn said hagrid indignantly ter do with magical creatures an she thinks got somethin ter do with me yeh know bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since i got back i don wan ter go o course but if it wasn fer well the special circumstances abou ter explain to yeh leave righ now before go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school like she did with trelawney 
 
 harry and hermione both made noises of protest but hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands 
 
 not the end o the world be able ter help dumbledore once outta here i can be useful ter the order an you have get through yer exams fine 
 
 his voice trembled and broke 
 
 don worry abou me he said hastily as hermione made to pat his arm he pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it look i wouldn be tellin yer this at all if i didn have ter see if i go well i can leave withou withou tellin someone because need yeh two ter help me an ron if willin 
 
 of course help you said harry at once what do you want us to do 
 
 hagrid gave a great sniff and patted harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force harry was knocked sideways into a tree 
 
 i knew say yes said hagrid into his handkerchief but i won never forget well jus a little bit further through here watch yerselves now nettles 
 
 they walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop 
 
 really easy he said softly very quiet now 
 
 they crept forwards and harry saw that they were facing a large smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as hagrid that he thought with a jolt of dread was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade behind which harry hermione and hagrid now stood 
 
 sleepin breathed hagrid 
 
 sure enough harry could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work he glanced sideways at hermione who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open she looked utterly terrified 
 
 hagrid she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature who is he 
 
 harry found this an odd question what is it was the one he had been planning on asking 
 
 hagrid you told us said hermione her wand now shaking in her hand you told us none of them wanted to come 
 
 harry looked from her to hagrid and then as realisation hit him he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror 
 
 the great mound of earth on which he hermione and hagrid could easily have stood was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep grunting breathing it was not a mound at all it was the curved back of what was clearly 
 
 wellnohe didn want ter come said hagrid sounding desperate but i had ter bring him hermione i had ter 
 
 but why asked hermione who sounded as though she wanted to cry whywhatoh hagrid 
 
 i knew if i jus got him back said hagrid sounding close to tears himself taught him a few be able ter take him outside an show harmless 
 
 harmless said hermione shrilly and hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep been hurting you all this time he why had all these injuries 
 
 he don know his own strength said hagrid earnestly an gettin better not fightin so much any more 
 
 so this is why it took you two months to get home said hermione distractedly oh hagrid why did you bring him back if he want to come he have been happier with his own people 
 
 they were all bullyin him hermione cause so small said hagrid 
 
 small said hermione small 
 
 hermione i couldn leave him said hagrid tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard my brother 
 
 hermione simply stared at him her mouth open 
 
 hagrid when you say brother said harry slowly do you mean 
 
 well amended hagrid turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad an she went an had grawp here 
 
 grawp said harry 
 
 yeah well what it sounds like when he says his name said hagrid anxiously he don speak a lot of english bin tryin ter teach him anyway she don seem ter have liked him much she liked me see with giantesses what counts is producin good big kids and always been a bit on the runty side fer a sixteen foot 
 
 oh yes tiny said hermione with a kind of hysterical sarcasm absolutely minuscule 
 
 he was bein kicked aroun by all o themi jus couldn leave him 
 
 did madame maxime want to bring him back asked harry 
 
 shewell she could see it was right importan ter me said hagrid twisting his enormous hands she got a bit tired o him after a while i must admit so we split up on the journey home she promised not ter tell anyone though 
 
 how on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing said harry 
 
 well why it took so long see said hagrid could travel by nigh an through wild country an stuff course he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter but he kep wantin ter go back 
 
 oh hagrid why on earth you let him said hermione flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands what do you think going to do with a violent giant who even want to be here 
 
 well now a bit harsh said hagrid still twisting his hands agitatedly admit he mighta taken a couple o swings at me when bin in a bad mood but gettin better loads better settlin down well 
 
 what are those ropes for then harry asked 
 
 he had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them 
 
 you have to keep him tied up said hermione faintly 
 
 well yeah said hagrid looking anxious like i sayhe doesn really know is own strength 
 
 harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest 
 
 so what is it you want harry and ron and me to do hermione asked apprehensively 
 
 look after him said hagrid croakily after gone 
 
 harry and hermione exchanged miserable looks harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised hagrid that he would do whatever he asked 
 
 whatwhat does that involve exactly hermione enquired 
 
 not food or anythin said hagrid eagerly he can get his own food no problem birds an deer an stuff no company he needs i xxjus knew someone was carryin on trying ter help him a bit teachin him yeh know 
 
 harry said nothing but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them unlike hagrid who simply looked like an oversized human grawp looked strangely misshapen what harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as head it was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling hair the colour of bracken the rim of a single large fleshy ear was visible on top of the head which seemed to sit rather like uncle directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between the back under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together was very broad and as grawp slept it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins the legs were curled up under the body harry could see the soles of enormous filthy bare feet large as sledges resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor 
 
 you want us to teach him harry said in a hollow voice he now understood what warning had meant his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon course the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard fruitless attempts to teach grawp english 
 
 yeaheven if yeh jus talk ter him a bit said hagrid hopefully cause i reckon if he can talk ter people understand more that we all like im really an want im ter stay 
 
 harry looked at hermione who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face 
 
 kind of makes you wish we had norbert back it he said and she gave a very shaky laugh 
 
 do it then said hagrid who did not seem to have caugit what harry had just said 
 
 said harry already bound by his promise try hagrid 
 
 i knew i could count on yeh harry hagrid said beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again an i don wan yeh ter put yerself out too much like i know got exams if yeh could jus nip down here in yer invisibility cloak maybe once a week an have a little chat with im wake im up thenintroduce yeh 
 
 whano said hermione jumping up hagrid no wake him really we need 
 
 but hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards grawp when he was about ten feet away he lifted a long broken bough from the ground smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at harry and hermione then poked grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough 
 
 the giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away in front of harry and hermione meanwhile the gigantic grawp was rising from the ground which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees he turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him 
 
 all righ grawpy said hagrid in a cheery voice backing away with the long bough raised ready to poke grawp again had a nice sleep eh 
 
 harry and hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted they looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing it was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball the nose was stubby and shapeless the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of the eyes small by giant standards were a muddy and just now were together with sleep grawp raised dirty knuckles each as big as a cricket ball to his eyes rubbed vigorously then without warning pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility 
 
 oh my harry heard hermione squeal terrified beside him 
 
 the trees to which the other ends of the ropes around wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously he was as hagrid had said at least sixteen feet tall gazing blearily around grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella seized a nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself 
 
 anyway grawpy shouted hagrid looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs brought some friends ter meet yeh remember i told yeh i might remember when i said i might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit remember that grawpy 
 
 but grawp merely gave another low roar it was hard to say whether he was listening to hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds hagrid was making as speech he had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go 
 
 now grawpy don do that shouted hagrid how you ended up pullin up the others 
 
 and sure enough harry could see the earth around the roots beginning to crack 
 
 i got company for yeh hagrid shouted company see look down yeh big buffoon i brought yeh some friends 
 
 oh hagrid moaned hermione but hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave knee a sharp poke 
 
 the giant let go of the top of the tree which swayed alarmingly and deluged hagrid with a rain of pine needles and looked down 
 
 this said hagrid hastening over to where harry and herrmone stood is harry grawp harry potter he migh be comin ter visit yeh if i have ter go away understand 
 
 the giant had only just realised that harry and hermione were there they watched in great trepidation as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them 
 
 an this is hermione see her hagrid hesitated turning to hermione he said would yeh mind if he called yeh hermy hermione a difficult name fer him ter remember 
 
 no not at all squeaked hermione 
 
 this is hermy grawp an gonna be comin an all tha nice eh two friends fer yeh tergrawpy no 
 
 hand had shot out of nowhere towards hermione harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree so that fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air 
 
 bad boy grawpy they heard hagrid yelling as hermione clung to harry behind the tree shaking and whimpering very bad boy yeh don grabouch 
 
 harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw hagrid lying on his back his hand over his nose grawp apparently losing interest had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go 
 
 righ said hagrid thickly getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow well there yeh are met him an an now know yeh when yeh come back yeah well 
 
 he looked up at grawp who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground 
 
 well i reckon enough fer one day said hagrid go back now shall we 
 
 harry and hermione nodded hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and still pinching his nose led the way back into the trees 
 
 nobody spoke for a while not even when they heard the distant crash that meant grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last face was pale and set harry could not think of a single thing to say what on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that hagrid had hidden grawp in the forbidden forest and he had promised that he ron and hermione would continue totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant how could hagrid even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless fool himself that grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans 
 
 hold it said hagrid abruptly just as harry and hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him he pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow harry and hermione raised their wands now that they had stopped walking they too could hear movement close by 
 
 oh blimey said hagrid quietly 
 
 i thought we told you hagrid said a deep male voice that you are no longer welcome here 
 
 a naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a chestnut body this centaur had a proud face and long black hair like hagrid he was armed a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders 
 
 how are yeh magorian said hagrid warily 
 
 the trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him harry recognised the and bearded bane whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met firenze bane gave no sign that he had ever seen harry before 
 
 so he said with a nasty inflection in his voice before turning immediately to magorian we agreed i think what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the forest again 
 
 this human now am i said hagrid testily jus fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder 
 
 you ought not to have meddled hagrid said magorian our ways are not yours nor are our laws firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us 
 
 i dunno how yeh work that out said hagrid impatiently done nothin except help albus dumbledore 
 
 firenze has entered into servitude to humans said a grey centaur with a hard deeply lined face 
 
 servitude said hagrid scathingly doin dumbledore a favour is all 
 
 he is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans said magorian quietly there can be no return from such disgrace 
 
 if yeh say so said hagrid shrugging but personally i think makin a big mistake 
 
 as are you human said bane coming back into our forest when we warned you 
 
 now yeh listen ter me said hagrid angrily have less of the our forest if all the same ter yeh not up ter yeh who comes an goes in here 
 
 no more is it up to you hagrid said magorian smoothly i shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young 
 
 not his interrupted bane contemptuously students magorian from up at the school they have probably already profited from the traitor teachings 
 
 nevertheless said magorian calmly the slaughter of foals is a terrible crimewe do not touch the innocent today hagrid you pass henceforth stay away from this place you forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor firenze escape us 
 
 i won be kept outta the fores by a bunch o old mules like yeh said hagrid loudly 
 
 hagrid said hermione in a and terrified voice as both bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground go please go 
 
 hagrid moved forwards but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon magorian 
 
 we know what you are keeping in the forest hagrid magorian called after them as the centaurs slipped out of sight and our tolerance is waning 
 
 hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to magorian 
 
 tolerate im as long as here as much his forest as yours he yelled as harry and hermione both pushed with all their might against moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards still scowling he looked down his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him he seemed not to have felt it 
 
 calm down you two he said turning to walk on while they parted along behind him ruddy old mules though eh 
 
 hagrid said hermione breathlessly skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there if the centaurs want humans in the forest it really look as though harry and i will be able 
 
 ah you heard what they said said hagrid dismissively they hurt foalsi mean kids anyway we can let ourselves be pushed aroun by that lot 
 
 nice try harry murmured to hermione who looked crestfallen 
 
 at last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes the trees began to thin they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and in the distance the definite sounds of cheering and shouting 
 
 was that another goal asked hagrid pausing in the shelter of the trees as the quidditch stadium came into view or reckon the match is over 
 
 i know said hermione miserably harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear her hair was full of twigs and leaves her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms he knew he must look little better 
 
 i reckon over yeh know said hagrid still squinting towards the stadium look people comin out alreadyif yeh two hurry be able ter blend in with the crowd an no know yeh there 
 
 good idea said harry well see you later then hagrid 
 
 i believe him said hermione in a very unsteady voice the moment they were out of earshot of hagrid i believe him i really believe him 
 
 calm down said harry 
 
 calm down she said feverishly a giant a giant in the forest and supposed to give him english lessons always assuming of course we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out him 
 
 we got to do anything yet harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice as they joined a stream of jabbering hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen 
 
 oh come off it harry said hermione angrily stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her of course going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest after what just seen who can blame umbridge 
 
 there was a pause in which harry glared at her and her eyes filled slowly with tears 
 
 you mean that said harry quietly 
 
 no well all right i she said wiping her eyes angrily but why does he have to make life so difficult for himselffor us 
 
 i dunno 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 
 and i wish stop singing that stupid song said hermione miserably they gloated enough 
 
 a great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch 
 
 oh get in before we have to meet the slytherins said hermione 
 
 weasley can save anything 
 
 he never leaves a single ring 
 
 why gryffindors all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 hermione said harry slowly 
 
 the song was growing louder but it was issuing not from a crowd of slytherins but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 no said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 yes said harry loudly 
 
 harry hermione yelled ron waving the silver quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself we did it we won 
 
 they beamed up at him as he passed there was a scrum at the door of the castle and head got rather badly bumped on the lintel but nobody seemed to want to put him down still singing the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight harry and hermione watched them go beaming until the last echoing strains of weasley is our king died away then they turned to each other their smiles fading 
 
 save our news till tomorrow shall we said harry 
 
 yes all right said hermione wearily not in any hurry 
 
 they climbed the steps together at the front doors both instinctively looked back at the forbidden forest harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots

lionfish nov chapter thirty grawpcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the story of fred and flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of legend within a week even those who had been were they had seen the twins umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with dungbombs before zooming out of the doors in the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them harry frequently heard students saying things like honestly some days i just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place or else one more lesson like that and i might just do a weasley 
 
 fred and george had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon for one thing they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing umbridge and filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success eventually the area was roped off and filch gnashing his teeth furiously was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms harry was certain that teachers like mcgonagall or flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but just as in the case of fred and wildfire they seemed to prefer to watch umbridge struggle 
 
 then there were the two large holes in office door through which fred and cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters filch fitted a new door and removed firebolt to the dungeons where it was rumoured umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it however her troubles were far from over 
 
 inspired by fred and example a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of in spite of the new door somebody managed to slip a niffler into office which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects leapt on umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers dungbombs and stink pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform charms on themselves before leaving lessons which ensured them a supply of fresh air even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing goldfish bowls on their heads 
 
 filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands desperate to catch miscreants but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn the inquisitorial squad was attempting to help him but odd things kept happening to its members warrington of the slytherin quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes pansy parkinson to delight missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers 
 
 meanwhile it became clear just how many skiving snackboxes fred and george had managed to sell before leaving hogwarts umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint vomit develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from umbridgeitis after putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding swooning sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves 
 
 but not even the users of the snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos peeves who seemed to have taken parting words deeply to heart cackling madly he soared through the school upending tables bursting out of blackboards toppling statues and vases twice he shut mrs norris inside a suit of armour from which she was rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the great hall during breakfast and whenever he fancied a break spent hours at a time floating along after umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke 
 
 none of the staff but filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her indeed a week after fred and departure harry witnessed professor mcgonagall walking right past peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth it unscrews the other way 
 
 to cap matters montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one tuesday morning striding up the front drive looking extremely angry 
 
 should we say something said hermione in a worried voice pressing her cheek against the charms window so that she could see mr and mrs montague marching inside about what happened to him in case it helps madam pomfrey cure him 
 
 course not recover said ron indifferently 
 
 anyway more trouble for umbridge it said harry in a satisfied voice 
 
 he and ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty trembled for a few seconds then folded causing the cup to crack into two 
 
 reparo said hermione quickly mending cup with a wave of her wand all very well but what if permanently injured 
 
 who cares said ron irritably while his teacup stood up drunkenly again trembling violently at the knees montague have tried to take all those points from gryffindor should he if you want to worry about anyone hermione worry about me 
 
 you she said catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little legs and replacing it in front of her why should i be worried about you 
 
 when next letter finally gets through screening process said ron bitterly now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight going to be in deep trouble i be surprised if sent another howler 
 
 but 
 
 be my fault fred and george left you wait said ron darkly say i stopped them leaving i grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something yeah be all my fault 
 
 well if she say that be very unfair you have done anything but sure she i mean if really true got premises in diagon alley they must have been planning this for ages 
 
 yeah but another thing how did they get premises said ron hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him a bit dodgy it need loads of galleons to afford the rent on a place in diagon alley want to know what been up to to get their hands on that sort of gold 
 
 well yes that occurred to me too said hermione allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop been wondering whether mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful 
 
 he said harry curtly 
 
 how do you know said ron and hermione together 
 
 because harry hesitated but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come there was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that fred and george were criminals because they got the gold from me i gave them my triwizard winnings last june 
 
 there was a shocked silence then teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor 
 
 oh harry you she said 
 
 yes i did said harry mutinously and i regret it either i need the gold and be great at running a joke shop 
 
 but this is excellent said ron looking thrilled all your fault harrymum blame me at all can i tell her 
 
 yeah i suppose better said harry dully specially if she thinks receiving stolen cauldrons or something 
 
 hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson but harry had a shrewd suspicion that her was bound to crack before long sure enough once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak may sunshine she fixed harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air 
 
 harry interrupted her before she had even started 
 
 no good nagging me done he said firmly fred and george have got the gold spent a good bit of it too by the sounds of itand i get it back from them and i want to so save your breath hermione 
 
 i going to say anything about fred and george she said in an injured voice 
 
 ron snorted disbelievingly and hermione threw him a very dirty look 
 
 no i she said angrily as a matter of fact i was going to ask harry when going to go back to snape and ask for more occlumency lessons 
 
 heart sank once they had exhausted the subject of fred and dramatic departure which admittedly had taken many hours ron and hermione had wanted to hear news of sirius as harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to sirius in the first place it had been hard to think of what to tell them he had ended up saying truthfully that sirius wanted harry to resume occlumency lessons he had been regretting this ever since hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when harry least expected it 
 
 you tell me stopped having funny dreams hermione said now because ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night 
 
 harry threw ron a furious look ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself 
 
 you were only muttering a bit he mumbled apologetically something about just a bit further 
 
 i dreamed i was watching you lot play quidditch harry lied brutally i was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the quaffle 
 
 ears went red harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure he had not of course dreamed anything of the sort 
 
 last night he had once again made the journey along the department of mysteries corridor he had passed through the circular room then the room full of clicking and dancing light until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres 
 
 he had hurried straight towards row number turned left and run along it it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud just a bit further for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake and before he had reached the end of the row he had found himself lying in bed again gazing up at the canopy of his 
 
 you are trying to block your mind you said hermione looking beadily at harry you are keeping going with your occlumency 
 
 of course i am said harry trying to sound as though this question was insulting but not quite meeting her eye the truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue 
 
 the problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all and when he did his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams he also suspected that part of his mindthe part that often spoke in voicenow felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door and sought to wake him before he could reach the end 
 
 you know said ron whose ears were still flaming red if montague recover before slytherin play hufflepuff we might be in with a chance of winning the cup 
 
 yeah i so said harry glad of a change of subject 
 
 i mean won one lost oneif slytherin lose to hufflepuff next saturday 
 
 yeah right said harry losing track of what he was agreeing to cho chang had just walked across the courtyard determinedly not looking at him 
 
 the final match of the quidditch season gryffindor versus ravenclaw was to take place on the last weekend of may although slytherin had been narrowly defeated by hufflepuff in their last match gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory due mainly though of course nobody said it to him to abysmal record he however seemed to have found a new optimism 
 
 i mean i get any worse can i he told harry and hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match nothing to lose now is there 
 
 you know said hermione as she and harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd i think ron might do better without fred and george around they never exactly gave him a lot of confidence 
 
 luna lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head 
 
 oh gosh i forgot said hermione watching the eagle flapping its wings as luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing slytherins cho will be playing she 
 
 harry who had not forgotten this merely grunted 
 
 they found seats in the topmost row of the stands it was a fine ckar day ron could not wish for better and harry found himself hoping against hope that ron would not give the slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of weasley is our king 
 
 lee jordan who had been very dispirited since fred and george had left was commentating as usual as the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto 
 
 bradley davies chang he said and harry felt his stomach perform less of a back flip more a feeble lurch as cho walked out on to the pitch her shiny black hair rippling in the slight was not sure what he wanted to happen any more except that he could not stand any more rows even the sight of her chatting animatedly to roger davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy 
 
 and off said lee and davies takes the quaffle immediately ravenclaw captain davies with the quaffle he dodges johnson he dodges bell he dodges spinnet as well going straight for goal going to shootandand lee swore very loudly and scored 
 
 harry and hermione groaned with the rest of the gryffindors predictably horribly the slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 harry said a hoarse voice in ear hermione 
 
 harry looked round and saw enormous bearded face sticking between the seats apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind for the first and he had just passed had a ruffled flattened look about them for some reason hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else 
 
 listen he whispered can yeh come with me now while watchin the match 
 
 er it wait hagrid asked harry till the match is over 
 
 no said hagrid no harry gotta be now while lookin the other way please 
 
 nose was gently dripping blood his eyes were both blackened harry had not seen him this since his return to the school he looked utterly woebegone 
 
 course said harry at once course come 
 
 he and hermione edged back along their row of seats causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them the people in row were not complaining merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible 
 
 i ppreciate this you two i really do said hagrid as they reached the stairs he kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below i jus hope she doesn notice us goin 
 
 you mean umbridge said harry she got her whole inquisitorial squad sitting with her you see she must be expecting trouble at the match 
 
 yeah well a bit o trouble wouldn hurt said hagrid pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted give us more time 
 
 what is it hagrid said hermione looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the forest 
 
 see in a mo said hagrid looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them heydid someone jus score 
 
 be ravenclaw said harry heavily 
 
 good good said hagrid distractedly good 
 
 they had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn looking around with every other step when they reached his cabin hermione turned automatically left towards the front door hagrid however walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree when he realised they were no longer with him he turned 
 
 goin in here he said jerking his shaggy head behind him 
 
 into the forest said hermione perplexed 
 
 yeah said hagrid now quick before spotted 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then ducked into the cover of the trees behind hagrid who was already striding away from them into the green gloom his crossbow over his arm harry and hermione ran to catch up with him 
 
 hagrid why are you armed said harry 
 
 jus a precaution said hagrid shrugging his massive shoulders 
 
 you bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals said hermione timidly 
 
 nah well we weren goin in so far then said hagrid an anyway tha was before firenze left the forest wasn it 
 
 why does firenze leaving make a difference asked hermione curiously 
 
 cause the other centaurs are good an riled at me why said hagrid quietly glancing around they used ter bewell yeh couldn call em friendlybut we got on all righ kept emselves to emselves bu always turned up if i wanted a word not any more 
 
 he sighed deeply 
 
 firenze said angry because he went to work for dumbledore harry said tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching profile 
 
 yeah said hagrid heavily well angry doesn cover it ruddy livid if i hadn stepped in i reckon kicked firenze ter death 
 
 they attacked him said hermione sounding shocked 
 
 yep said hagrid gruffly forcing his way through several branches he had half the herd on to him 
 
 and you stopped it said harry amazed and impressed by yourself 
 
 course i did stand by an watch em kill im could i said hagrid lucky i was passin really an thought firenze mighta remembered tha before he started sendin me stupid he added hotly and unexpectedly 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other startled but hagrid scowling did not elaborate 
 
 anyway he said breathing a little more heavily than usud since then the other bin livid with me an the trouble is got a lot of influence in the forest cleverest creatures in here 
 
 is that why here hagrid asked hermione the centaurs 
 
 ah no said hagrid shaking his head dismissively no not them well o course they could complicate the problem yeah but see what i mean in a bit 
 
 on this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead taking one stride for every three of theirs so that they had great trouble keeping up with him 
 
 the path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the forest that it was as dark as dusk they were soon a long way past the clearing where hagrid had shown them the thestrals but harry felt no sense of unease until hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the forest 
 
 hagrid said harry fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles over which hagrid had stepped with ease and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the forest path where are we going 
 
 bit further said hagrid over his shoulder harry we need ter keep together now 
 
 it was a great struggle to keep up with hagrid what with branches and thickets of thorn through which hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs but which snagged harry and robes frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches they were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all harry could see of hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence the breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow caused harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit it occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him as rather ominous 
 
 hagrid would it be all right if we lit our wands said hermione quietly 
 
 er all righ hagrid whispered back in fact 
 
 he stopped suddenly and turned around hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor 
 
 maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen so i can fill yeh in said hagrid before we ge there like 
 
 good said hermione as harry set her back on her feet they both murmured lumos and their ignited face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad 
 
 righ said hagrid well see the thing is 
 
 he took a great breath 
 
 well a good chance goin ter be gettin the sack any day now he said 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then back at him 
 
 but lasted this long hermione said tentatively what makes you think 
 
 umbridge reckons it was me that put tha niffler in her office 
 
 and was it said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 no it ruddy well wasn said hagrid indignantly ter do with magical creatures an she thinks got somethin ter do with me yeh know bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since i got back i don wan ter go o course but if it wasn fer well the special circumstances abou ter explain to yeh leave righ now before go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school like she did with trelawney 
 
 harry and hermione both made noises of protest but hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands 
 
 not the end o the world be able ter help dumbledore once outta here i can be useful ter the order an you have get through yer exams fine 
 
 his voice trembled and broke 
 
 don worry abou me he said hastily as hermione made to pat his arm he pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it look i wouldn be tellin yer this at all if i didn have ter see if i go well i can leave withou withou tellin someone because need yeh two ter help me an ron if willin 
 
 of course help you said harry at once what do you want us to do 
 
 hagrid gave a great sniff and patted harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force harry was knocked sideways into a tree 
 
 i knew say yes said hagrid into his handkerchief but i won never forget well jus a little bit further through here watch yerselves now nettles 
 
 they walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop 
 
 really easy he said softly very quiet now 
 
 they crept forwards and harry saw that they were facing a large smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as hagrid that he thought with a jolt of dread was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade behind which harry hermione and hagrid now stood 
 
 sleepin breathed hagrid 
 
 sure enough harry could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work he glanced sideways at hermione who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open she looked utterly terrified 
 
 hagrid she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature who is he 
 
 harry found this an odd question what is it was the one he had been planning on asking 
 
 hagrid you told us said hermione her wand now shaking in her hand you told us none of them wanted to come 
 
 harry looked from her to hagrid and then as realisation hit him he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror 
 
 the great mound of earth on which he hermione and hagrid could easily have stood was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep grunting breathing it was not a mound at all it was the curved back of what was clearly 
 
 wellnohe didn want ter come said hagrid sounding desperate but i had ter bring him hermione i had ter 
 
 but why asked hermione who sounded as though she wanted to cry whywhatoh hagrid 
 
 i knew if i jus got him back said hagrid sounding close to tears himself taught him a few be able ter take him outside an show harmless 
 
 harmless said hermione shrilly and hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep been hurting you all this time he why had all these injuries 
 
 he don know his own strength said hagrid earnestly an gettin better not fightin so much any more 
 
 so this is why it took you two months to get home said hermione distractedly oh hagrid why did you bring him back if he want to come he have been happier with his own people 
 
 they were all bullyin him hermione cause so small said hagrid 
 
 small said hermione small 
 
 hermione i couldn leave him said hagrid tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard my brother 
 
 hermione simply stared at him her mouth open 
 
 hagrid when you say brother said harry slowly do you mean 
 
 well amended hagrid turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad an she went an had grawp here 
 
 grawp said harry 
 
 yeah well what it sounds like when he says his name said hagrid anxiously he don speak a lot of english bin tryin ter teach him anyway she don seem ter have liked him much she liked me see with giantesses what counts is producin good big kids and always been a bit on the runty side fer a sixteen foot 
 
 oh yes tiny said hermione with a kind of hysterical sarcasm absolutely minuscule 
 
 he was bein kicked aroun by all o themi jus couldn leave him 
 
 did madame maxime want to bring him back asked harry 
 
 shewell she could see it was right importan ter me said hagrid twisting his enormous hands she got a bit tired o him after a while i must admit so we split up on the journey home she promised not ter tell anyone though 
 
 how on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing said harry 
 
 well why it took so long see said hagrid could travel by nigh an through wild country an stuff course he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter but he kep wantin ter go back 
 
 oh hagrid why on earth you let him said hermione flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands what do you think going to do with a violent giant who even want to be here 
 
 well now a bit harsh said hagrid still twisting his hands agitatedly admit he mighta taken a couple o swings at me when bin in a bad mood but gettin better loads better settlin down well 
 
 what are those ropes for then harry asked 
 
 he had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them 
 
 you have to keep him tied up said hermione faintly 
 
 well yeah said hagrid looking anxious like i sayhe doesn really know is own strength 
 
 harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest 
 
 so what is it you want harry and ron and me to do hermione asked apprehensively 
 
 look after him said hagrid croakily after gone 
 
 harry and hermione exchanged miserable looks harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised hagrid that he would do whatever he asked 
 
 whatwhat does that involve exactly hermione enquired 
 
 not food or anythin said hagrid eagerly he can get his own food no problem birds an deer an stuff no company he needs i xxjus knew someone was carryin on trying ter help him a bit teachin him yeh know 
 
 harry said nothing but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them unlike hagrid who simply looked like an oversized human grawp looked strangely misshapen what harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as head it was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling hair the colour of bracken the rim of a single large fleshy ear was visible on top of the head which seemed to sit rather like uncle directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between the back under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together was very broad and as grawp slept it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins the legs were curled up under the body harry could see the soles of enormous filthy bare feet large as sledges resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor 
 
 you want us to teach him harry said in a hollow voice he now understood what warning had meant his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon course the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard fruitless attempts to teach grawp english 
 
 yeaheven if yeh jus talk ter him a bit said hagrid hopefully cause i reckon if he can talk ter people understand more that we all like im really an want im ter stay 
 
 harry looked at hermione who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face 
 
 kind of makes you wish we had norbert back it he said and she gave a very shaky laugh 
 
 do it then said hagrid who did not seem to have caugit what harry had just said 
 
 said harry already bound by his promise try hagrid 
 
 i knew i could count on yeh harry hagrid said beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again an i don wan yeh ter put yerself out too much like i know got exams if yeh could jus nip down here in yer invisibility cloak maybe once a week an have a little chat with im wake im up thenintroduce yeh 
 
 whano said hermione jumping up hagrid no wake him really we need 
 
 but hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards grawp when he was about ten feet away he lifted a long broken bough from the ground smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at harry and hermione then poked grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough 
 
 the giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away in front of harry and hermione meanwhile the gigantic grawp was rising from the ground which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees he turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him 
 
 all righ grawpy said hagrid in a cheery voice backing away with the long bough raised ready to poke grawp again had a nice sleep eh 
 
 harry and hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted they looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing it was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball the nose was stubby and shapeless the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of the eyes small by giant standards were a muddy and just now were together with sleep grawp raised dirty knuckles each as big as a cricket ball to his eyes rubbed vigorously then without warning pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility 
 
 oh my harry heard hermione squeal terrified beside him 
 
 the trees to which the other ends of the ropes around wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously he was as hagrid had said at least sixteen feet tall gazing blearily around grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella seized a nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself 
 
 anyway grawpy shouted hagrid looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs brought some friends ter meet yeh remember i told yeh i might remember when i said i might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit remember that grawpy 
 
 but grawp merely gave another low roar it was hard to say whether he was listening to hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds hagrid was making as speech he had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go 
 
 now grawpy don do that shouted hagrid how you ended up pullin up the others 
 
 and sure enough harry could see the earth around the roots beginning to crack 
 
 i got company for yeh hagrid shouted company see look down yeh big buffoon i brought yeh some friends 
 
 oh hagrid moaned hermione but hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave knee a sharp poke 
 
 the giant let go of the top of the tree which swayed alarmingly and deluged hagrid with a rain of pine needles and looked down 
 
 this said hagrid hastening over to where harry and herrmone stood is harry grawp harry potter he migh be comin ter visit yeh if i have ter go away understand 
 
 the giant had only just realised that harry and hermione were there they watched in great trepidation as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them 
 
 an this is hermione see her hagrid hesitated turning to hermione he said would yeh mind if he called yeh hermy hermione a difficult name fer him ter remember 
 
 no not at all squeaked hermione 
 
 this is hermy grawp an gonna be comin an all tha nice eh two friends fer yeh tergrawpy no 
 
 hand had shot out of nowhere towards hermione harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree so that fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air 
 
 bad boy grawpy they heard hagrid yelling as hermione clung to harry behind the tree shaking and whimpering very bad boy yeh don grabouch 
 
 harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw hagrid lying on his back his hand over his nose grawp apparently losing interest had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go 
 
 righ said hagrid thickly getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow well there yeh are met him an an now know yeh when yeh come back yeah well 
 
 he looked up at grawp who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground 
 
 well i reckon enough fer one day said hagrid go back now shall we 
 
 harry and hermione nodded hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and still pinching his nose led the way back into the trees 
 
 nobody spoke for a while not even when they heard the distant crash that meant grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last face was pale and set harry could not think of a single thing to say what on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that hagrid had hidden grawp in the forbidden forest and he had promised that he ron and hermione would continue totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant how could hagrid even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless fool himself that grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans 
 
 hold it said hagrid abruptly just as harry and hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him he pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow harry and hermione raised their wands now that they had stopped walking they too could hear movement close by 
 
 oh blimey said hagrid quietly 
 
 i thought we told you hagrid said a deep male voice that you are no longer welcome here 
 
 a naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a chestnut body this centaur had a proud face and long black hair like hagrid he was armed a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders 
 
 how are yeh magorian said hagrid warily 
 
 the trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him harry recognised the and bearded bane whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met firenze bane gave no sign that he had ever seen harry before 
 
 so he said with a nasty inflection in his voice before turning immediately to magorian we agreed i think what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the forest again 
 
 this human now am i said hagrid testily jus fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder 
 
 you ought not to have meddled hagrid said magorian our ways are not yours nor are our laws firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us 
 
 i dunno how yeh work that out said hagrid impatiently done nothin except help albus dumbledore 
 
 firenze has entered into servitude to humans said a grey centaur with a hard deeply lined face 
 
 servitude said hagrid scathingly doin dumbledore a favour is all 
 
 he is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans said magorian quietly there can be no return from such disgrace 
 
 if yeh say so said hagrid shrugging but personally i think makin a big mistake 
 
 as are you human said bane coming back into our forest when we warned you 
 
 now yeh listen ter me said hagrid angrily have less of the our forest if all the same ter yeh not up ter yeh who comes an goes in here 
 
 no more is it up to you hagrid said magorian smoothly i shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young 
 
 not his interrupted bane contemptuously students magorian from up at the school they have probably already profited from the traitor teachings 
 
 nevertheless said magorian calmly the slaughter of foals is a terrible crimewe do not touch the innocent today hagrid you pass henceforth stay away from this place you forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor firenze escape us 
 
 i won be kept outta the fores by a bunch o old mules like yeh said hagrid loudly 
 
 hagrid said hermione in a and terrified voice as both bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground go please go 
 
 hagrid moved forwards but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon magorian 
 
 we know what you are keeping in the forest hagrid magorian called after them as the centaurs slipped out of sight and our tolerance is waning 
 
 hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to magorian 
 
 tolerate im as long as here as much his forest as yours he yelled as harry and hermione both pushed with all their might against moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards still scowling he looked down his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him he seemed not to have felt it 
 
 calm down you two he said turning to walk on while they parted along behind him ruddy old mules though eh 
 
 hagrid said hermione breathlessly skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there if the centaurs want humans in the forest it really look as though harry and i will be able 
 
 ah you heard what they said said hagrid dismissively they hurt foalsi mean kids anyway we can let ourselves be pushed aroun by that lot 
 
 nice try harry murmured to hermione who looked crestfallen 
 
 at last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes the trees began to thin they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and in the distance the definite sounds of cheering and shouting 
 
 was that another goal asked hagrid pausing in the shelter of the trees as the quidditch stadium came into view or reckon the match is over 
 
 i know said hermione miserably harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear her hair was full of twigs and leaves her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms he knew he must look little better 
 
 i reckon over yeh know said hagrid still squinting towards the stadium look people comin out alreadyif yeh two hurry be able ter blend in with the crowd an no know yeh there 
 
 good idea said harry well see you later then hagrid 
 
 i believe him said hermione in a very unsteady voice the moment they were out of earshot of hagrid i believe him i really believe him 
 
 calm down said harry 
 
 calm down she said feverishly a giant a giant in the forest and supposed to give him english lessons always assuming of course we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out him 
 
 we got to do anything yet harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice as they joined a stream of jabbering hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen 
 
 oh come off it harry said hermione angrily stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her of course going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest after what just seen who can blame umbridge 
 
 there was a pause in which harry glared at her and her eyes filled slowly with tears 
 
 you mean that said harry quietly 
 
 no well all right i she said wiping her eyes angrily but why does he have to make life so difficult for himselffor us 
 
 i dunno 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 
 and i wish stop singing that stupid song said hermione miserably they gloated enough 
 
 a great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch 
 
 oh get in before we have to meet the slytherins said hermione 
 
 weasley can save anything 
 
 he never leaves a single ring 
 
 why gryffindors all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 hermione said harry slowly 
 
 the song was growing louder but it was issuing not from a crowd of slytherins but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 no said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 yes said harry loudly 
 
 harry hermione yelled ron waving the silver quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself we did it we won 
 
 they beamed up at him as he passed there was a scrum at the door of the castle and head got rather badly bumped on the lintel but nobody seemed to want to put him down still singing the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight harry and hermione watched them go beaming until the last echoing strains of weasley is our king died away then they turned to each other their smiles fading 
 
 save our news till tomorrow shall we said harry 
 
 yes all right said hermione wearily not in any hurry 
 
 they climbed the steps together at the front doors both instinctively looked back at the forbidden forest harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirty the white tombcontents prev chapter 
 all lessons were suspended all examinations postponed some students were hurried away from hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of daysthe patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following death and zacharias smith was escorted from the castle by his father seamus finnigan on the other hand refused to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral she had difficulty in finding a bed in hogsmeade seamus told harry and ron for wizards and witches were pouring into the village preparing to pay their last respects to dumbledore 
 
 some excitement was caused among the younger students who had never seen it before when a carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting arms meanwhile a delegation of ministry officials including the minister for magic himself was being accommodated within the castle harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them he was sure that sooner or later he would be asked again to account for last excursion from hogwarts 
 
 harry ron hermione and ginny were spending all of their time together the beautiful weather seemed to mock them harry could imagine how it would have been if dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year examinations finished the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew it was right to do because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort 
 
 they visited the hospital wing twice a day neville had been discharged but bill remained under madam care his scars were as bad as ever in truth he now bore a distinct resemblance to moody though thankfully with both eyes and legs but in personality he seemed just the same as ever all that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks 
 
 so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said fleur happily plumping up pillows because ze british overcook their meat i ave always said this 
 
 i suppose just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her sighed ginny later that evening as she harry ron and hermione sat beside the open window of the gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit grounds 
 
 not that bad said harry ugly though he added hastily as ginny raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle 
 
 well i suppose if mum can stand it i can 
 
 anyone else we know died ron asked hermione who was perusing the evening prophet 
 
 hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice 
 
 no she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper still looking for snape but no sign 
 
 of course there said harry who became angry every time this subject cropped up they find snape till they find voldemort and seeing as never managed to do that in all this time 
 
 going to go to bed yawned ginny i been sleeping that well since well i could do with some sleep 
 
 she kissed harry ron looked away pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the girls dormitories the moment the door had closed behind her hermione leaned forwards towards harry with a most look on her face 
 
 harry i found something out this morning in the library 
 
 said harry sitting up straight 
 
 he did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone there might still be as many as four horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that voldemort could be killed he kept reciting their names to himself as though by listing them he could bring them within reach the locket the cup the snake something of or the locket the cup the snake something of or 
 
 this mantra seemed to pulse through mind as he fell asleep at night and his dreams were thick with cups lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach though dumbledore helpfully offered harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb 
 
 he had shown hermione the note inside the locket the morning after death and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do 
 
 no she said sadly been trying harry but i found anything there are a couple of reasonably wizards with those initialsrosalind antigone bungs rupert axebanger brookstanton but they seem to fit at all judging by that note the person who stole the horcrux knew voldemort and i find a shred of evidence that bungs or axebanger ever had anything to do with him no actually about well snape 
 
 she looked nervous even saying the name again 
 
 what about him asked harry heavily slumping back in his chair 
 
 well just that i was sort of right about the prince business she said tentatively 
 
 have to rub it in hermione how do you think i feel about that now 
 
 nonoharry i mean that she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard just that i was right about eileen prince once owning the book you see she was mother 
 
 i thought she much of a looker said ron hermione ignored him 
 
 i was going through the rest of the old prophets and there was a tiny announcement about eileen prince marrying a man called tobias snape and then later an announcement saying that given birth to a 
 
 murderer spat harry 
 
 well yes said hermione so i was sort of right snape must have been proud of being half a prince you see tobias snape was a muggle from what it said in the prophet 
 
 yeah that fits said harry play up the side so he could get in with lucius malfoy and the rest of them just like voldemort mother muggie father ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the dark arts gave himself an impressive new namelord voldemortthe princehow could dumbledore have missed 
 
 he broke off looking out of the window he could not stop himself dwelling upon inexcusable trust in snape but as hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he harry had been taken in just the same in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much 
 
 helped him it was an almost unendurable thought now 
 
 i still get why he turn you in for using that book said ron he known where you were getting it all from 
 
 he knew said harry bitterly he knew when i used sectumsempra he really need legilimency he might even have known before then with slughom talking about how brilliant i was at potions have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he 
 
 but why he turn you in 
 
 i think he wanted to associate himself with that book said hermione i think dumbledore would have liked it very much if known and even if snape pretended it been his slughom would have recognised his writing at once anyway the book was left in old classroom and bet dumbledore knew his mother was called prince 
 
 i shown the book to dumbledore said harry all that time he was showing me how voldemort was evil even when he was at school and i had proof snape was too 
 
 evil is a strong word said hermione quietly 
 
 you were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous 
 
 trying to say harry that pulling too much blame on yourself i thought the prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour but i would never have guessed he was a potential killer 
 
 none of us guessed snape would you know said ron 
 
 silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thoughts but harry was sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when body would be laid to rest harry had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when sirius had died he did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel he wondered whether death would be more real to him once the funeral was over though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that dumbledore had really gone admittedly he had not as he had with sirius looked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that dumbledore would come back he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not as a talisman but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do 
 
 harry rose early to pack the next day the hogwarts express would be leaving an hour after the funeral downstairs he found the mood in the great hall subdued everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry professor mcgonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty chair was deserted too harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but place had been unceremoniously filled by rufus scrimgeour harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the hall harry had the uncomfortable feeling that scrimgeour was looking for him among entourage harry spotted the red hair and glasses of percy weasley ron gave no sign that he was aware of percy apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom 
 
 over at the slytherin table crabbe and goyle were muttering together hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of malfoy between them bossing them around harry had not spared malfoy much thought his animosity was all for snape but he had not forgotten the fear in voice on that tower top nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other death eaters arrived harry did not believe that malfoy would have killed dumbledore he despised malfoy still for his infatuation with the dark arts but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike where harry wondered was malfoy now and what was voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents 
 
 thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from ginny professor mcgonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once 
 
 it is nearly time she said please follow your heads of house out into the grounds gryffindors after me 
 
 they filed out from behind their benches in near silence harry glimpsed slughorn at the head of the slytherin column wearing magnificent long robes embroidered with silver he had never seen professor sprout head of the hufflepuffs looking so clean there was not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found madam pince standing beside filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs 
 
 they were heading as harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors towards the lake the warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed professor mcgonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows an aisle ran down the centre of them there was a marble table standing at the front all chairs facing it it was the most beautiful day 
 
 an extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs shabby and smart old and young most harry did not recognise but there were a few that he did including members of the order of the phoenix kingsley shacklebolt moody tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink remus lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hands mr and mrs weasley bill supported by fleur and followed by fred and george who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin then there was madame maxime who took up chairs on her own tom the landlord of the leaky cauldron arabella figg squib neighbour the hairy bass player from the wizarding group the weird bisters ernie prang driver of the knight bus madam malkin of the robe shop in diagon alley and some people whom harry merely knew by sight such as the barman of the head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the hogwarts express the castle ghosts were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air 
 
 harry ron hermione and ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake people were whispering to each other it sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong was louder by far the crowd continued to swell with a great rush of affection for both of them harry saw neville being helped into a seat by luna they alone of all the da had responded to summons the night that dumbledore had died and harry knew why they were the ones who had missed the da most probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting 
 
 cornelius fudge walked past them towards the front rows his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat as usual harry next recognised rita skeeter who he was infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her hand and then with a worse jolt of fury dolores umbridge an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velvet bow set atop her curls at the sight of the centaur firenze who was standing like a sentinel near the edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away 
 
 the staff were seated at last harry could see scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with professor mcgonagall he wondered whether scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that dumbledore was dead but then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the ministry in looking around for the source of it he was not the only one many heads were turning searching a little alarmed 
 
 in there whispered ginny in ear 
 
 and he saw them in the clear green sunlit water inches below the surface reminding him horribly of the inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand their pallid faces rippling their purplish hair flowing all around them the music made the hair on neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant it spoke very clearly of loss and of despair as he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for passing then ginny nudged him again and he looked round 
 
 hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs he was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his arms wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars was what harry knew to be body a sharp pain rose in throat at this sight for a moment the strange music and the knowledge that body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day ron looked white and shocked tears were falling thick and fast into both ginny and laps 
 
 they could not see clearly what was happening at the front hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table now he retreated down the aisle blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some including harry saw dolores umbridge but harry knew that dumbledore would not have cared he tried to make a friendly gesture to hagrid as he passed but eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going harry glanced at the back row to which hagrid was heading and realised what was guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee was the giant grawp his great ugly head bowed docile almost human hagrid sat down next to his and grawp patted hagrid hard on the head so that his chair legs sank into the ground harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh but then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again 
 
 a little man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of body harry could not hear what he was saying odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads nobility of spirit intellectual contribution greatness of heart it did not mean very much it had little to do with dumbledore as harry had known him he suddenly remembered idea of a few words nitwit oddment blubber and tweak and again had to suppress a grin what was the matter with him 
 
 there was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too he remembered dumbledore crouching at the edge two years ago very close to where harry now sat and conversing in mermish with the merchieftainess harry wondered where dumbledore had learned mermish there was so much he had never asked him so much he should have said 
 
 and then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now dumbledore was dead gone he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes he looked away from ginny and the others and stared out over the lake towards the forest as the little man in black droned on there was movement among the trees the centaurs had come to pay their respects too they did not move into the open but harry saw them standing quite still in shadow watching the wizards their bows hanging at their sides and harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter it was important dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated 
 
 and harry saw very clearly as be sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that was over he could not let anybody else stand between him and voldemort he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a arms meant that nothing could hurt him there was no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before 
 
 the little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the minister but nobody moved 
 
 then several people screamed bright white flames had erupted around body and the table upon which it lay higher and higher they rose obscuring the body white smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes harry thought for one moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished in its place was a white marble tomb encasing body and the table on which he had rested 
 
 there were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd it was harry knew the centaurs tribute he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view 
 
 harry looked at ginny ron and hermione face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him face was glazed with tears but ginny was no longer crying she met gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the quidditch cup in his absence and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he was going to do now she would not say be careful or do it but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him and so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since dumbledore had died 
 
 ginny listen he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet i be involved with you any more got to stop seeing each other we be together 
 
 she said with an oddly twisted smile for some stupid noble reason it 
 
 been like like something out of someone life these last few weeks with you said harry but i we got things to do alone now 
 
 she did not cry she simply looked at him 
 
 voldemort uses people his enemies are close to already used you as bait once and that was just because my best sister think how much danger be in if we keep this up know find out try and get to me through you 
 
 what if i care said ginny fiercely 
 
 i care said harry how do you think feel if this was your funeral and it was my fault 
 
 she looked away from him over the lake 
 
 i never really gave up on you she said not really i always hoped hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because i never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember and she thought you might take a bit more notice if i was a bit moremyself 
 
 smart girl that hermione said harry trying to smile i just wish asked you sooner we had ages months years maybe 
 
 but been too busy saving the wizarding world said ginny well i say surprised i knew this would happen in the end i knew you be happy unless you were hunting voldemort maybe why i like you so much 
 
 harry could not bear to hear these things nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her ron he saw was now holding hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dripping from the end of his own long nose with a miserable gesture harry got up turned his back on ginny and on tomb and walked away around the lake moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the horcruxes and kill voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it 
 
 harry 
 
 he turned rufus scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank leaning on his walking stick 
 
 been hoping to have a word do you mind if i walk a little way with you 
 
 no said harry indifferently and set off again 
 
 harry this was a dreadful tragedy said scrimgeour quietly i cannot tell you how appalled i was to hear of it dumbledore was a very great wizard we had our disagreements as you know but no one knows better than i 
 
 what do you want asked harry flatly 
 
 scrimgeour looked annoyed but as before hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding 
 
 you are of course devastated he said i know that you were very close to dumbledore i think you may have been his favourite ever pupil the bond between the two of you 
 
 what do you want harry repeated coming to a halt 
 
 scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at harry his expression shrewd now 
 
 the word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died 
 
 whose word said harry 
 
 somebody stupefied a death eater on top of the tower after dumbledore died there were also two broomsticks up there the ministry can add two and two harry 
 
 glad to hear it said harry well where i went with dumbledore and what we did is my business he want people to know 
 
 such loyalty is admirable of course said scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty but dumbledore is gone harry gone 
 
 he will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him said harry smiling in spite of himself 
 
 my dear boy even dumbledore cannot return from the 
 
 i am not saying he can you understand but got nothing to tell you 
 
 scrimgeour hesitated then said in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy the ministry can offer you all sorts of protection you know harry i would be delighted to place a couple of my aurors at your service 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 voldemort wants to kill me himself and aurors stop him so thanks for the offer but no thanks 
 
 so said scrimgeour his voice cold now the request i made of you at christmas 
 
 what request oh yeah the one where i tell the world what a great job doing in exchange for 
 
 for raising morale snapped scrimgeour 
 
 harry considered him for a moment 
 
 released stan shunpike yet 
 
 scrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly reminiscent of uncle vernon 
 
 i see you are 
 
 man through and through said harry right 
 
 scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word harry could see percy and the rest of the ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glances at the sobbing hagrid and grawp who were still in their seats ron and hermione were hurrying towards harry passing scrimgeour going in the opposite direction harry turned and walked slowly on waiting for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times 
 
 what did scrimgeour want hermione whispered 
 
 same as he wanted at christmas shrugged harry wanted me to give him inside information on dumbledore and be the new poster boy 
 
 ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to hermione look let me go back and hit percy 
 
 no she said firmly grabbing his arm 
 
 make me feel better 
 
 harry laughed even hermione grinned a little though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle 
 
 i bear the idea that we might never come back she said softly how can hogwarts close 
 
 maybe it said ron not in any more danger here than we are at home are we the same now even say hogwarts is safer there are more wizards inside to defend the place what reckon harry 
 
 not coming back even if it does reopen said harry 
 
 ron gaped at him but hermione said knew you were going to say that but then what will you do 
 
 going back to the dursleys once more because dumbledore wanted me to said be a short visit and then be gone for good 
 
 but where will you go if you come back to school 
 
 i thought i might go back to hollow harry muttered he had had the idea in his head ever since the night of death for me it started there all of it just got a feeling i need to go there and i can visit my parents graves like that 
 
 and then what said ron 
 
 then got to track down the rest of the horcruxes i said harry his eyes upon white tomb reflected in the water on the other side of the lake what he wanted me to do why he told me all about them if dumbledore was rightand sure he wasthere are still four of them out there got to find them and destroy them and then got to go after the seventh bit of soul the bit still in his body and the one going to kill him and if i meet severus snape along the way he added so much the better for me so much the worse for him 
 
 there was a long silence the crowd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of grawp a wide berth as he cuddled hagrid whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water 
 
 be there harry said ron 
 
 what 
 
 at your aunt and house said ron and then go with you wherever going 
 
 no said harry quickly he had not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone 
 
 you said to us once before said hermione quietly that there was time to turn back if we wanted to had time we 
 
 with you whatever happens said ron but mate going to have to come round my mum and house before we do anything else even hollow 
 
 why 
 
 bill and wedding remember 
 
 harry looked at him startled the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful 
 
 yeah we miss that he said finally 
 
 his hand closed automatically around the fake horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come whether in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione

lionfish nov chapter thirty the white tombcontents prev chapter 
 all lessons were suspended all examinations postponed some students were hurried away from hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of daysthe patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following death and zacharias smith was escorted from the castle by his father seamus finnigan on the other hand refused to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral she had difficulty in finding a bed in hogsmeade seamus told harry and ron for wizards and witches were pouring into the village preparing to pay their last respects to dumbledore 
 
 some excitement was caused among the younger students who had never seen it before when a carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting arms meanwhile a delegation of ministry officials including the minister for magic himself was being accommodated within the castle harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them he was sure that sooner or later he would be asked again to account for last excursion from hogwarts 
 
 harry ron hermione and ginny were spending all of their time together the beautiful weather seemed to mock them harry could imagine how it would have been if dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year examinations finished the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew it was right to do because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort 
 
 they visited the hospital wing twice a day neville had been discharged but bill remained under madam care his scars were as bad as ever in truth he now bore a distinct resemblance to moody though thankfully with both eyes and legs but in personality he seemed just the same as ever all that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks 
 
 so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said fleur happily plumping up pillows because ze british overcook their meat i ave always said this 
 
 i suppose just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her sighed ginny later that evening as she harry ron and hermione sat beside the open window of the gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit grounds 
 
 not that bad said harry ugly though he added hastily as ginny raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle 
 
 well i suppose if mum can stand it i can 
 
 anyone else we know died ron asked hermione who was perusing the evening prophet 
 
 hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice 
 
 no she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper still looking for snape but no sign 
 
 of course there said harry who became angry every time this subject cropped up they find snape till they find voldemort and seeing as never managed to do that in all this time 
 
 going to go to bed yawned ginny i been sleeping that well since well i could do with some sleep 
 
 she kissed harry ron looked away pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the girls dormitories the moment the door had closed behind her hermione leaned forwards towards harry with a most look on her face 
 
 harry i found something out this morning in the library 
 
 said harry sitting up straight 
 
 he did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone there might still be as many as four horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that voldemort could be killed he kept reciting their names to himself as though by listing them he could bring them within reach the locket the cup the snake something of or the locket the cup the snake something of or 
 
 this mantra seemed to pulse through mind as he fell asleep at night and his dreams were thick with cups lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach though dumbledore helpfully offered harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb 
 
 he had shown hermione the note inside the locket the morning after death and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do 
 
 no she said sadly been trying harry but i found anything there are a couple of reasonably wizards with those initialsrosalind antigone bungs rupert axebanger brookstanton but they seem to fit at all judging by that note the person who stole the horcrux knew voldemort and i find a shred of evidence that bungs or axebanger ever had anything to do with him no actually about well snape 
 
 she looked nervous even saying the name again 
 
 what about him asked harry heavily slumping back in his chair 
 
 well just that i was sort of right about the prince business she said tentatively 
 
 have to rub it in hermione how do you think i feel about that now 
 
 nonoharry i mean that she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard just that i was right about eileen prince once owning the book you see she was mother 
 
 i thought she much of a looker said ron hermione ignored him 
 
 i was going through the rest of the old prophets and there was a tiny announcement about eileen prince marrying a man called tobias snape and then later an announcement saying that given birth to a 
 
 murderer spat harry 
 
 well yes said hermione so i was sort of right snape must have been proud of being half a prince you see tobias snape was a muggle from what it said in the prophet 
 
 yeah that fits said harry play up the side so he could get in with lucius malfoy and the rest of them just like voldemort mother muggie father ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the dark arts gave himself an impressive new namelord voldemortthe princehow could dumbledore have missed 
 
 he broke off looking out of the window he could not stop himself dwelling upon inexcusable trust in snape but as hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he harry had been taken in just the same in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much 
 
 helped him it was an almost unendurable thought now 
 
 i still get why he turn you in for using that book said ron he known where you were getting it all from 
 
 he knew said harry bitterly he knew when i used sectumsempra he really need legilimency he might even have known before then with slughom talking about how brilliant i was at potions have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he 
 
 but why he turn you in 
 
 i think he wanted to associate himself with that book said hermione i think dumbledore would have liked it very much if known and even if snape pretended it been his slughom would have recognised his writing at once anyway the book was left in old classroom and bet dumbledore knew his mother was called prince 
 
 i shown the book to dumbledore said harry all that time he was showing me how voldemort was evil even when he was at school and i had proof snape was too 
 
 evil is a strong word said hermione quietly 
 
 you were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous 
 
 trying to say harry that pulling too much blame on yourself i thought the prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour but i would never have guessed he was a potential killer 
 
 none of us guessed snape would you know said ron 
 
 silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thoughts but harry was sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when body would be laid to rest harry had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when sirius had died he did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel he wondered whether death would be more real to him once the funeral was over though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that dumbledore had really gone admittedly he had not as he had with sirius looked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that dumbledore would come back he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not as a talisman but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do 
 
 harry rose early to pack the next day the hogwarts express would be leaving an hour after the funeral downstairs he found the mood in the great hall subdued everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry professor mcgonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty chair was deserted too harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but place had been unceremoniously filled by rufus scrimgeour harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the hall harry had the uncomfortable feeling that scrimgeour was looking for him among entourage harry spotted the red hair and glasses of percy weasley ron gave no sign that he was aware of percy apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom 
 
 over at the slytherin table crabbe and goyle were muttering together hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of malfoy between them bossing them around harry had not spared malfoy much thought his animosity was all for snape but he had not forgotten the fear in voice on that tower top nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other death eaters arrived harry did not believe that malfoy would have killed dumbledore he despised malfoy still for his infatuation with the dark arts but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike where harry wondered was malfoy now and what was voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents 
 
 thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from ginny professor mcgonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once 
 
 it is nearly time she said please follow your heads of house out into the grounds gryffindors after me 
 
 they filed out from behind their benches in near silence harry glimpsed slughorn at the head of the slytherin column wearing magnificent long robes embroidered with silver he had never seen professor sprout head of the hufflepuffs looking so clean there was not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found madam pince standing beside filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs 
 
 they were heading as harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors towards the lake the warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed professor mcgonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows an aisle ran down the centre of them there was a marble table standing at the front all chairs facing it it was the most beautiful day 
 
 an extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs shabby and smart old and young most harry did not recognise but there were a few that he did including members of the order of the phoenix kingsley shacklebolt moody tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink remus lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hands mr and mrs weasley bill supported by fleur and followed by fred and george who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin then there was madame maxime who took up chairs on her own tom the landlord of the leaky cauldron arabella figg squib neighbour the hairy bass player from the wizarding group the weird bisters ernie prang driver of the knight bus madam malkin of the robe shop in diagon alley and some people whom harry merely knew by sight such as the barman of the head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the hogwarts express the castle ghosts were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air 
 
 harry ron hermione and ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake people were whispering to each other it sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong was louder by far the crowd continued to swell with a great rush of affection for both of them harry saw neville being helped into a seat by luna they alone of all the da had responded to summons the night that dumbledore had died and harry knew why they were the ones who had missed the da most probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting 
 
 cornelius fudge walked past them towards the front rows his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat as usual harry next recognised rita skeeter who he was infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her hand and then with a worse jolt of fury dolores umbridge an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velvet bow set atop her curls at the sight of the centaur firenze who was standing like a sentinel near the edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away 
 
 the staff were seated at last harry could see scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with professor mcgonagall he wondered whether scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that dumbledore was dead but then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the ministry in looking around for the source of it he was not the only one many heads were turning searching a little alarmed 
 
 in there whispered ginny in ear 
 
 and he saw them in the clear green sunlit water inches below the surface reminding him horribly of the inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand their pallid faces rippling their purplish hair flowing all around them the music made the hair on neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant it spoke very clearly of loss and of despair as he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for passing then ginny nudged him again and he looked round 
 
 hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs he was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his arms wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars was what harry knew to be body a sharp pain rose in throat at this sight for a moment the strange music and the knowledge that body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day ron looked white and shocked tears were falling thick and fast into both ginny and laps 
 
 they could not see clearly what was happening at the front hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table now he retreated down the aisle blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some including harry saw dolores umbridge but harry knew that dumbledore would not have cared he tried to make a friendly gesture to hagrid as he passed but eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going harry glanced at the back row to which hagrid was heading and realised what was guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee was the giant grawp his great ugly head bowed docile almost human hagrid sat down next to his and grawp patted hagrid hard on the head so that his chair legs sank into the ground harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh but then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again 
 
 a little man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of body harry could not hear what he was saying odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads nobility of spirit intellectual contribution greatness of heart it did not mean very much it had little to do with dumbledore as harry had known him he suddenly remembered idea of a few words nitwit oddment blubber and tweak and again had to suppress a grin what was the matter with him 
 
 there was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too he remembered dumbledore crouching at the edge two years ago very close to where harry now sat and conversing in mermish with the merchieftainess harry wondered where dumbledore had learned mermish there was so much he had never asked him so much he should have said 
 
 and then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now dumbledore was dead gone he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes he looked away from ginny and the others and stared out over the lake towards the forest as the little man in black droned on there was movement among the trees the centaurs had come to pay their respects too they did not move into the open but harry saw them standing quite still in shadow watching the wizards their bows hanging at their sides and harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter it was important dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated 
 
 and harry saw very clearly as be sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that was over he could not let anybody else stand between him and voldemort he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a arms meant that nothing could hurt him there was no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before 
 
 the little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the minister but nobody moved 
 
 then several people screamed bright white flames had erupted around body and the table upon which it lay higher and higher they rose obscuring the body white smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes harry thought for one moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished in its place was a white marble tomb encasing body and the table on which he had rested 
 
 there were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd it was harry knew the centaurs tribute he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view 
 
 harry looked at ginny ron and hermione face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him face was glazed with tears but ginny was no longer crying she met gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the quidditch cup in his absence and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he was going to do now she would not say be careful or do it but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him and so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since dumbledore had died 
 
 ginny listen he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet i be involved with you any more got to stop seeing each other we be together 
 
 she said with an oddly twisted smile for some stupid noble reason it 
 
 been like like something out of someone life these last few weeks with you said harry but i we got things to do alone now 
 
 she did not cry she simply looked at him 
 
 voldemort uses people his enemies are close to already used you as bait once and that was just because my best sister think how much danger be in if we keep this up know find out try and get to me through you 
 
 what if i care said ginny fiercely 
 
 i care said harry how do you think feel if this was your funeral and it was my fault 
 
 she looked away from him over the lake 
 
 i never really gave up on you she said not really i always hoped hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because i never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember and she thought you might take a bit more notice if i was a bit moremyself 
 
 smart girl that hermione said harry trying to smile i just wish asked you sooner we had ages months years maybe 
 
 but been too busy saving the wizarding world said ginny well i say surprised i knew this would happen in the end i knew you be happy unless you were hunting voldemort maybe why i like you so much 
 
 harry could not bear to hear these things nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her ron he saw was now holding hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dripping from the end of his own long nose with a miserable gesture harry got up turned his back on ginny and on tomb and walked away around the lake moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the horcruxes and kill voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it 
 
 harry 
 
 he turned rufus scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank leaning on his walking stick 
 
 been hoping to have a word do you mind if i walk a little way with you 
 
 no said harry indifferently and set off again 
 
 harry this was a dreadful tragedy said scrimgeour quietly i cannot tell you how appalled i was to hear of it dumbledore was a very great wizard we had our disagreements as you know but no one knows better than i 
 
 what do you want asked harry flatly 
 
 scrimgeour looked annoyed but as before hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding 
 
 you are of course devastated he said i know that you were very close to dumbledore i think you may have been his favourite ever pupil the bond between the two of you 
 
 what do you want harry repeated coming to a halt 
 
 scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at harry his expression shrewd now 
 
 the word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died 
 
 whose word said harry 
 
 somebody stupefied a death eater on top of the tower after dumbledore died there were also two broomsticks up there the ministry can add two and two harry 
 
 glad to hear it said harry well where i went with dumbledore and what we did is my business he want people to know 
 
 such loyalty is admirable of course said scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty but dumbledore is gone harry gone 
 
 he will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him said harry smiling in spite of himself 
 
 my dear boy even dumbledore cannot return from the 
 
 i am not saying he can you understand but got nothing to tell you 
 
 scrimgeour hesitated then said in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy the ministry can offer you all sorts of protection you know harry i would be delighted to place a couple of my aurors at your service 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 voldemort wants to kill me himself and aurors stop him so thanks for the offer but no thanks 
 
 so said scrimgeour his voice cold now the request i made of you at christmas 
 
 what request oh yeah the one where i tell the world what a great job doing in exchange for 
 
 for raising morale snapped scrimgeour 
 
 harry considered him for a moment 
 
 released stan shunpike yet 
 
 scrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly reminiscent of uncle vernon 
 
 i see you are 
 
 man through and through said harry right 
 
 scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word harry could see percy and the rest of the ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glances at the sobbing hagrid and grawp who were still in their seats ron and hermione were hurrying towards harry passing scrimgeour going in the opposite direction harry turned and walked slowly on waiting for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times 
 
 what did scrimgeour want hermione whispered 
 
 same as he wanted at christmas shrugged harry wanted me to give him inside information on dumbledore and be the new poster boy 
 
 ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to hermione look let me go back and hit percy 
 
 no she said firmly grabbing his arm 
 
 make me feel better 
 
 harry laughed even hermione grinned a little though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle 
 
 i bear the idea that we might never come back she said softly how can hogwarts close 
 
 maybe it said ron not in any more danger here than we are at home are we the same now even say hogwarts is safer there are more wizards inside to defend the place what reckon harry 
 
 not coming back even if it does reopen said harry 
 
 ron gaped at him but hermione said knew you were going to say that but then what will you do 
 
 going back to the dursleys once more because dumbledore wanted me to said be a short visit and then be gone for good 
 
 but where will you go if you come back to school 
 
 i thought i might go back to hollow harry muttered he had had the idea in his head ever since the night of death for me it started there all of it just got a feeling i need to go there and i can visit my parents graves like that

 there was a long silence the crowd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of grawp a wide berth as he cuddled hagrid whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water 
 
 be there harry said ron 
 
 what 
 
 at your aunt and house said ron and then go with you wherever going 
 
 no said harry quickly he had not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone

 with you whatever happens said ron but mate going to have to come round my mum and house before we do anything else even hollow 
 
 why 
 
 bill and wedding remember 
 
 harry looked at him startled the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful 
 
 yeah we miss that he said finally 
 
 his hand closed automatically around the fake horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come whether in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione

lionfish nov chapter thirty the sacking of severus snapecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the moment her finger touched the mark harrys scar burned savagely the starry room vanished from sight and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff and the sea was washing around him and there was a triumph in his heart c they have the boy 
 
 a loud bang brought harry back to where he stood disoriented he raised his wand but the witch before him was already falling forward she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled 
 
 ive never stunned anyone except in our lessons said luna sounding mildly interested that was noisier than i though it would be 
 
 and sure enough the ceiling had begun to tremble scurrying echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories lunas spell had woken ravenclaws sleeping above 
 
 luna where are you i need to get under the cloak 
 
 lunas feet appeared out of nowhere he hurried to her side and she let the cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of ravenclaws all in their nightclothes flooded into the common room there were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw alecto lying there unconscious slowly they shuffled in around her a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them then one brave little darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe 
 
 i think she might be dead he shouted with delight 
 
 oh look whispered luna happily as the ravenclaws crowded in around alecto theyre pleased 
 
 yeah great 
 
 harry closed his eyes and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into voldemorts mind he was moving along the tunnel into the first cave he had chosen to make sure of the locker before comingbut that would not take him long 
 
 there was a rap on the common room door and every ravenclaw froze from the other side harry heard the soft musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker where do vanished objects go 
 
 i dunno do i shut it snarled an uncouth voice that harry knew was that of the carrow brother amycus alecto alecto are you there have you got him open the door 
 
 the ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves terrified then without warning there came a series of loud bangs as though somebody was firing a gun into the door 
 
 alecto if he comes and we havent got potter c dyou want to go the same way as the malfoys answer me amycus bellowed shaking the door for all he was worth but still it did not open the ravenclaws were all backing away and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the stair case to their beds then just as harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and stun amycus before the death eater could do anything else a second most familiar voice rang out beyond the door 
 
 may i ask what you are doing professor carrow 
 
 trying c to getc through this damned c door shouted amycus go and get flitwick get him to open it now 
 
 but isnt your sister in there asked professor mcgonagall didnt professor flitwick let her in earlier this evening at your urgent request perhaps she could open the door for you then you neednt wake up half the castle 
 
 she aint answering you old besom you open it darn do it now 
 
 certainly if you wish it said professor mcgonagall with awful coldness there was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again 
 
 where do vanished objects go 
 
 into non being which is to say everything replied professor mcgonagall 
 
 nicely phrased replied the eagle door knocker and the door swung open 
 
 the few ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as amycus burst over the threshold brandishing his wand hunched like his sister he had a pallid doughy face and tiny eyes which fell at once on alecto sprawled motionless on the floor he let out a yell of fury and fear 
 
 whatve they done the little whelps he screamed ill cruciate the lot of em till they tell me who did it c and whats the dark lord going to say he shrieked standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist we havent got him and theyve gone and killed her 
 
 shes only stunned said professor mcgonagall impatiently who had stooped down to examine alecto shell be perfectly all right 
 
 no she bludgering well wont bellowed amycus not after the dark lord gets hold of her shes gone and sent for him i felt me mark burn and he thinks weve got potter 
 
 got potter said professor mcgonagall sharply what do you mean got potter 
 
 he told us potter might try and get inside ravenclaw tower and to send for him if we caught him 
 
 why would harry potter try to get inside ravenclaw tower potter belongs in my house 
 
 beneath the disbelief and anger harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice and affection for minerva mcgonagall gushed up inside him 
 
 we was told he might come in here said carrow i dunno why do i 
 
 professor mcgonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room twice they passed right over the place where harry and luna stood 
 
 we can push it off on the kids said amycus his pig like face suddenly crafty yeah thats what well do well say alecto was ambushed by the kids them kids up there c he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories c and well say they forced her to pres her mark and thats why he got a false alarm he can punish them couple of kids more or less whats the difference 
 
 only the difference between truth and lie courage and cowardice said professor mcgonagall who had turned pale a difference in short which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate but let me make one thing very clear you are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of hogwarts i shall not permit it 
 
 excuse me 
 
 amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to professor mcgonagall his face within inches of hers she refused to back away but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat 
 
 its not a case of what youll permit minerva mcgonagall your times over its us whats in charge here now and youll back me up or youll pay the price 
 
 and he spat in her face 
 
 harry pulled the cloak off himself raised his wand and said you shouldnt have done that 
 
 as amycus spun around harry shouted crucio 
 
 the death eater was lifted off his feet he writhed through the air like a drowning man thrashing and howling in pain and then with a crunch and a shattering of glass he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled insensible to the floor i see what bellatrix meant said harry the blood thundering through his brain you need to really mean it 
 
 potter whispered professor mcgonagall clutching her heart potter c youre here whatc howc she struggled to pull herself together potter that was foolish 
 
 he spat at you said harry 
 
 potter i c that was very c gallant of you c but dont you realize c 
 
 yeah i do harry assured her somehow her panic steadied him professor mcgonagall voldemorts on the way 
 
 oh are we allowed to say the name now asked luna with an air of interest pulling off the invisibility cloak the appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm professor mcgonagall who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown 
 
 i dont think it makes any difference what we call him harry told luna he already knows where i am 
 
 in a distant part of harrys brain that part connected to the angry burning scar he could see voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat he had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood 
 
 you must flee whispered professor mcgonagall now potter as quickly as you can 
 
 i cant said harry theres something i need to do professor so you know where the diadem of ravenclaw is 
 
 the of ravenclaw of course not c hasnt it been lost for centuries she sat up a little straighter potter it was madness utter madness for you to enter this castlec 
 
 i had to said harry professor theres something hidden here that im supposed to find and it could be the diademc if i could just speak to professor flitwickc 
 
 there was a sound of movement of clinking glass amycus was coming round before harry or luna could act professor mcgonagall rose to her feet pointed her wand at the groggy death eater and said imperio 
 
 amycus got up walked over to his sister picked up her wand then shuffled obediently to professor mcgonagall and handed it over along with his own then he lay down on the floor beside alecto professor mcgonagall waved her wand again and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the carrows binding them tightly together 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall turning to face him again with superb indifference to the carrows predicament if does indeed know that you are herec 
 
 as she said it a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through harry setting his scar on fire and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surfacec 
 
 potter are you all right said a voice and harry came back he was clutching lunas shoulder to steady himself 
 
 times running out voldemorts getting nearer professor im acting on dumbledores orders i must find what he wanted me to find but weve got to get the students out while im searching the castle c its me voldemort wants but he wont care about killing a few more or less not nowc not now he knows im attacking horcruxes harry finished the sentence in his head 
 
 youre acting on dumbledores orders she repeated with a look of dawning wonder then she drew herself up to her fullest height 
 
 we shall secure the school against while you search for this c this object 
 
 is that possible 
 
 i think so said professor mcgonagall dryly we teachers are rather good at magic you know i am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it of course something will have to be done about professor snapec 
 
 let me c 
 
 cand if hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege with the dark lord at the gates it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible with the floo network under observation and apparition impossible within the groundsc 
 
 theres a way said harry quickly and he explained about the passageway leading into the hogs head 
 
 potter were talking about hundreds of studentsc 
 
 i know professor but if voldemort and the death eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they wont be interested in anyone whos disapparating out of hogs head 
 
 theres something in that she agreed she pointed her wand at the carrows and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies tied itself around them and hoisted them into the air where they dangled beneath the ceiling like two large ugly sea creatures come we must alert the other heads of house youd better put that cloak back on 
 
 she marched toward the door and as she did so she raised her wand from the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes the patronuses ran sleekly ahead filling the spiral staircase with silvery light as professor mcgonagall harry and luna hurried back down 
 
 along the corridors they raced and one by one the patronuses left them professor mcgonagalls tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor and harry and luna jogged behind her under the cloak 
 
 they had descended two more floors when another set of quiet joined theirs harry whose scar was still prickling heard them first he felt in the pouch around his neck for the marauders map but before he could take it our mcgonagall too seemed to become aware of their company she halted raised her wand ready to duel and said whos there 
 
 it is i said a low voice 
 
 from behind a suit of armor stepped severus snape 
 
 hatred boiled up in harry at the sight of him he had forgotten the details of snapes appearance in the magnitude of his crimes forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face how his black eyes had a dead cold look he was not wearing nightclothes but was dressed in his usual black cloak and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight 
 
 where are the carrows he asked quietly 
 
 wherever you told them to be i expect severus said professor mcgonagall 
 
 snape stepped nearer and his eyes flitted over professor mcgonagall into the air around her as if he knew that harry was there harry held his wand up too ready to attack 
 
 i was under the impression said snape that alecto had apprehended an intruder 
 
 really said professor mcgonagall and what gave you that impression 
 
 snape mad a slight flexing movement of his left arm where the dark mark was branded into his skin 
 
 oh but naturally said professor mcgonagall you death eaters have your own private means of communication i forgot 
 
 snape pretended not to have heard her his eyes were still probing the air all about her and he was moving gradually closer with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing 
 
 i did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors minerva 
 
 you have some objection 
 
 i wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour 
 
 i thought i heard a disturbance said professor mcgonagall 
 
 really but all seems calm 
 
 snape looked into her eyes 
 
 have you seen harry potter minerva because if you have i must insistc 
 
 professor mcgonagall moved faster than harry could have believed her wand slashed through the air and for a split second harry thought that snape must crumple unconscious but the swiftness of his shield charm was such that mcgonagall was thrown off balance she brandished her wand at a touch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket harry about to curse snape was forced to pull luna out of the way of the descending flames which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at snapec then it was no longer fire but a great black serpent that mcgonagall blasted to smoke which and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him and with echoing clangs the daggers sank one after another into its breastc 
 
 minerva said a squeaky voice and looking behind him still shielding luna from flying spells harry saw professors flitwick and sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes with the enormous professor slughorn panting along at the rear 
 
 no squealed flitwick raising his wand youll do no more murder at hogwarts 
 
 flitwicks spell hit the suit of armor behind which snape had taken shelter with a clatter it came to life snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers harry and luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered when harry looked up again snape was in full flight mcgonagall flitwick and sprout all thundering after him he hurtled through a classroom door and moments later he heard mcgonagall cry coward coward 
 
 whats happened whats happened asked luna 
 
 harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor trailing the invisibility cloak behind them into the deserted classroom where professors mcgonagall flitwick and sprout were standing at a smashed window 
 
 he jumped said professor mcgonagall as harry and luna ran into the room 
 
 you mean hes dead harry sprinted to the window ignoring flitwicks and sprouts yells of shock at his sudden appearance 
 
 no hes not dead said mcgonagall bitterly unlike dumbledore he was still carrying a wand and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master 
 
 with a tingle of horror harry saw in the distance a huge bat like shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall 
 
 there were heavy footfalls behind them and a great deal of puffing slughorn had just caught up 
 
 harry he panted massaging his immense chest beneath his silk pajamas my dear boy what a surpriseminerva do please explainseveruswhat 
 
 our headmaster is taking a short break said professor mcgonagall pointing at the hole in the window 
 
 professor harry shouted his hand on his forehead he could see the lake sliding beneath him and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore and voldemort lept from it with murder in his heartc 
 
 professor weve got to barricade the school hes coming now 
 
 very well is coming she told the other teachers sprout and flitwick gasped slughorn let out a low groan potter has work to do in the castle on dumbledores orders we need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while potter does what he needs to do 
 
 you realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out indefinitely squeaked flitwick 
 
 but we can hold him up said professor sprout 
 
 thank you pomona said professor mcgonagall and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding 
 
 i suggest we establish basic protection around the place then gather our students and meet in the great hall most must be evacuated though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight i think they ought to be given the chance 
 
 agreed said professor sprout already hurrying toward the door i shall meet you in the great hall in twenty minutes with my house 
 
 and as she jogged out of sight they could hear her muttering tentacula devils snare and snargaluff podsyes id like to see the death eaters fighting those 
 
 i can act from here said flitwick and although he could barely see out of it he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity harry heard a weird rushing noise as though flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds 
 
 professor harry said approaching the little charms master professor im sorry to interrupt but this is important have you got any idea where the diadem of ravenclaw is 
 
 cprotego horribillis c the diadem of ravenclaw squeaked flitwick a little extra wisdom never goes amiss potter but i hardly think it would be much use in this situation 
 
 i only meant c do you know where it is have you ever seen it 
 
 seen it nobody has seen it in living memory long since lost boy 
 
 harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic what then was the horcrux 
 
 we shall meet you and your ravenclaws in the great hall filius said professor mcgonagall beckoning to harry and luna to follow her 
 
 they had just reached the door when slughorn rumbled into speech 
 
 my word he puffed pale and sweaty his walrus mustache aquiver what a im not at all sure whether this is wise minerva he is bound to find a way in you know and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous perilc 
 
 i shall expect you and the slytherins in the great hall in twenty minutes also said professor mcgonagall if you wish to leave with your students we shall not stop you but if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle then horace we duel to kill 
 
 minerva he said aghast 
 
 the time has come for slytherin house to decide upon its loyalties interrupted professor mcgonagall go and wake your students horace 
 
 harry did not stay to watch slughorn splutter he and luna stayed after professor mcgonagall who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand 
 
 piertotumcoh for heavens sake filch not nowc 
 
 the aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view shouting students out of bed students in the corridors 
 
 theyre supposed to be you blithering idiot shouted mcgonagall now go and do something constructive find peeves 
 
 stammered filch as though he had never heard the name before 
 
 yes peeves you fool peeves havent you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century go and fetch him at once 
 
 filch evidently thought professor mcgonagall had taken leave of her senses but hobbled away muttering under his breath 
 
 and now c piertotum locomator cried professor mcgonagall and all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same 
 
 hogwarts is threatened shouted professor mcgonagall man the boundaries protect us do your duty to our school 
 
 clattering and yelling the horde of moving statues stampeded past harry some of them smaller others larger than life there were animals too and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains 
 
 now potter said mcgonagall you and miss lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the great hall c i shall rouse the other gryffindors 
 
 they parted at the top of the next staircase harry and luna turning back toward the concealed entrance to the room of requirement as they ran they met crowds of students most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas being shepherded down to the great hall by teachers and prefects 
 
 that was potter 
 
 harry potter 
 
 it was him i swear i just saw him 
 
 but harry did not look back and at last they reached the entrance to the room of requirement harry leaned against the enchanted wall which opened to admit them and he and luna sped back down the steep staircase 
 
 whc 
 
 as the room came into view harry slipped down a few stairs in shock it was packed far more crowded than when he had last been in there kingsley and lupin were looking up at him as were oliver wood katie bell angelina johnson and alicia spinnet bill and fleur and mr and mrs weasley 
 
 harry whats happening said lupin meeting him at the foot of the stairs 
 
 voldemorts on his way theyre barricading he school c snapes run for it c what are you doing here how did you know 
 
 we sent messages to the rest of dumbledores army fred explained you couldnt expect everyone to miss the fun harry and the let the order of the phoenix know and it all kind of snowballed 
 
 what first harry called george whats going on 
 
 theyre evacuating the younger kids and everyones meeting in the great hall to get organized harry said were fighting 
 
 there was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs he was pressed back against he wall as they ran past hi the mingled members of the order of the phoenix dumbledores army and harrys old quidditch team all with their wands drawn heading up into the main castle 
 
 come on luna dean called as he passed holding out his free hand she took it and followed him back up the stairs 
 
 the crowd was thinning only a little knot of people remained below in the room of requirement and harry joined them mrs weasley was struggling with ginny around them stood lupin fred george bill and fleur 
 
 youre underage mrs weasley shouted at her daughter as harry approached i wont permit it the boys yes but you youve got to go home 
 
 i wont 
 
 ginnys hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mothers grip 
 
 im in dumbledores armyc 
 
 a teenagers gang 
 
 a teenagers gang thats about to take him on which no one else has dared to do said fred 
 
 shes sixteen shouted mrs weasley shes not old enough what you two were thinking bringing her with you c c 
 
 fred and george looked slightly ashamed of themselves 
 
 moms right ginny said bill gently you cant do this everyone underage will have to leave its only right 
 
 i cant go home ginny shouted angry tears sparkling in her eyes my whole familys here i cant stand waiting there alone and not knowing and c 
 
 her eyes met harrys for the first time she looked at him beseechingly but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly 
 
 fine she said staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the hogs head ill say now then andc 
 
 there was a scuffling and a great thump someone else had clambered out of the tunnel overbalanced slightly and fallen he pulled himself up no the nearest chair looked around through lopsided glasses and said am i too late has it started i only just found out so i c i c 
 
 percy spluttered into silence evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family there was a long moment of astonishment broken by fleur turning to lupin and saying in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension soc ow eez leetle teddy 
 
 lupin blinked at her startled the silence between the weasleys seemed to be solidifying like ice 
 
 i c oh yes c hes fine lupin said loudly yes tonks is with him c at her mothers c 
 
 percy and the other weasleys were still staring at one another frozen 
 
 here ive got a picture lupin shouted pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to fleur and harry who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair waving fat fists at the camera 
 
 i was a fool percy roared so loudly that lupin nearly dropped his photograph i was an idiot i was a pompous prat i was a c a c 
 
 moron said fred 
 
 percy swallowed 
 
 yes i was 
 
 well you cant say fairer than that said fred holding his hand out to percy 
 
 mrs weasley burst into tears she ran forward pushed fred aside and pulled percy into a strangling hug while he patted her on the back his eyes on his father 
 
 im sorry dad percy said 
 
 mr weasley blinked rather rapidly then he too hurried to hug his son 
 
 what made you see sense perce inquired george 
 
 its been coming on for a while said percy mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak but i had to find a way out and its not so easy at the ministry theyre imprisoning traitors all the time i managed to make contact with aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that hogwarts was going to make a fight of it so here i am 
 
 well we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these said george in a good imitation of percys most pompous manner now lets get upstairs and fight or all the good death eatersll be taken 
 
 so youre my sister now said percy shaking hands with fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with bill fred and george 
 
 ginny barked mrs weasley 
 
 ginny had been attempting under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs too 
 
 molly how about this said lupin why doesnt ginny stay here then at least shell be on the scene and know whats going on but she wont be in the middle of the fighting 
 
 ic 
 
 thats a good idea said mr weasley firmly ginny you stay in this room you hear me 
 
 ginny did not seem to like the idea much but under her fathers unusually stern gaze she nodded mr and mrs weasley and lupin headed off to the stairs as well 
 
 wheres ron asked harry wheres hermione 
 
 they must have gone up the great hall already mr weasley called over his shoulder 
 
 i didnt see them pass me said harry 
 
 they said something about a bathroom said ginny not long after you left 
 
 a bathroom 
 
 harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the room of requirement and checked the bathroom beyond it was empty 
 
 youre sure they said bathc 
 
 but then his scar seared and the room of vanished he was looking through the high gates with winged boats on pillars at either side looking through the dark grounds toward the castle which was ablaze with lights nagini lay draped over his shoulders he was possessed of that cold cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirty the sacking of severus snapecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the moment her finger touched the mark harrys scar burned savagely the starry room vanished from sight and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff and the sea was washing around him and there was a triumph in his heart c they have the boy 
 
 a loud bang brought harry back to where he stood disoriented he raised his wand but the witch before him was already falling forward she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled 
 
 ive never stunned anyone except in our lessons said luna sounding mildly interested that was noisier than i though it would be 
 
 and sure enough the ceiling had begun to tremble scurrying echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories lunas spell had woken ravenclaws sleeping above 
 
 luna where are you i need to get under the cloak 
 
 lunas feet appeared out of nowhere he hurried to her side and she let the cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of ravenclaws all in their nightclothes flooded into the common room there were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw alecto lying there unconscious slowly they shuffled in around her a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them then one brave little darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe 
 
 i think she might be dead he shouted with delight 
 
 oh look whispered luna happily as the ravenclaws crowded in around alecto theyre pleased 
 
 yeah great 
 
 harry closed his eyes and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into voldemorts mind he was moving along the tunnel into the first cave he had chosen to make sure of the locker before comingbut that would not take him long 
 
 there was a rap on the common room door and every ravenclaw froze from the other side harry heard the soft musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker where do vanished objects go 
 
 i dunno do i shut it snarled an uncouth voice that harry knew was that of the carrow brother amycus alecto alecto are you there have you got him open the door 
 
 the ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves terrified then without warning there came a series of loud bangs as though somebody was firing a gun into the door 
 
 alecto if he comes and we havent got potter c dyou want to go the same way as the malfoys answer me amycus bellowed shaking the door for all he was worth but still it did not open the ravenclaws were all backing away and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the stair case to their beds then just as harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and stun amycus before the death eater could do anything else a second most familiar voice rang out beyond the door 
 
 may i ask what you are doing professor carrow 
 
 trying c to getc through this damned c door shouted amycus go and get flitwick get him to open it now 
 
 but isnt your sister in there asked professor mcgonagall didnt professor flitwick let her in earlier this evening at your urgent request perhaps she could open the door for you then you neednt wake up half the castle 
 
 she aint answering you old besom you open it darn do it now 
 
 certainly if you wish it said professor mcgonagall with awful coldness there was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again 
 
 where do vanished objects go 
 
 into non being which is to say everything replied professor mcgonagall 
 
 nicely phrased replied the eagle door knocker and the door swung open 
 
 the few ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as amycus burst over the threshold brandishing his wand hunched like his sister he had a pallid doughy face and tiny eyes which fell at once on alecto sprawled motionless on the floor he let out a yell of fury and fear 
 
 whatve they done the little whelps he screamed ill cruciate the lot of em till they tell me who did it c and whats the dark lord going to say he shrieked standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist we havent got him and theyve gone and killed her 
 
 shes only stunned said professor mcgonagall impatiently who had stooped down to examine alecto shell be perfectly all right 
 
 no she bludgering well wont bellowed amycus not after the dark lord gets hold of her shes gone and sent for him i felt me mark burn and he thinks weve got potter 
 
 got potter said professor mcgonagall sharply what do you mean got potter 
 
 he told us potter might try and get inside ravenclaw tower and to send for him if we caught him 
 
 why would harry potter try to get inside ravenclaw tower potter belongs in my house 
 
 beneath the disbelief and anger harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice and affection for minerva mcgonagall gushed up inside him 
 
 we was told he might come in here said carrow i dunno why do i 
 
 professor mcgonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room twice they passed right over the place where harry and luna stood 
 
 we can push it off on the kids said amycus his pig like face suddenly crafty yeah thats what well do well say alecto was ambushed by the kids them kids up there c he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories c and well say they forced her to pres her mark and thats why he got a false alarm he can punish them couple of kids more or less whats the difference 
 
 only the difference between truth and lie courage and cowardice said professor mcgonagall who had turned pale a difference in short which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate but let me make one thing very clear you are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of hogwarts i shall not permit it 
 
 excuse me 
 
 amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to professor mcgonagall his face within inches of hers she refused to back away but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat 
 
 its not a case of what youll permit minerva mcgonagall your times over its us whats in charge here now and youll back me up or youll pay the price 
 
 and he spat in her face 
 
 harry pulled the cloak off himself raised his wand and said you shouldnt have done that 
 
 as amycus spun around harry shouted crucio 
 
 the death eater was lifted off his feet he writhed through the air like a drowning man thrashing and howling in pain and then with a crunch and a shattering of glass he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled insensible to the floor i see what bellatrix meant said harry the blood thundering through his brain you need to really mean it 
 
 potter whispered professor mcgonagall clutching her heart potter c youre here whatc howc she struggled to pull herself together potter that was foolish 
 
 he spat at you said harry 
 
 potter i c that was very c gallant of you c but dont you realize c 
 
 yeah i do harry assured her somehow her panic steadied him professor mcgonagall voldemorts on the way 
 
 oh are we allowed to say the name now asked luna with an air of interest pulling off the invisibility cloak the appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm professor mcgonagall who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown 
 
 i dont think it makes any difference what we call him harry told luna he already knows where i am 
 
 in a distant part of harrys brain that part connected to the angry burning scar he could see voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat he had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood 
 
 you must flee whispered professor mcgonagall now potter as quickly as you can 
 
 i cant said harry theres something i need to do professor so you know where the diadem of ravenclaw is 
 
 the of ravenclaw of course not c hasnt it been lost for centuries she sat up a little straighter potter it was madness utter madness for you to enter this castlec 
 
 i had to said harry professor theres something hidden here that im supposed to find and it could be the diademc if i could just speak to professor flitwickc 
 
 there was a sound of movement of clinking glass amycus was coming round before harry or luna could act professor mcgonagall rose to her feet pointed her wand at the groggy death eater and said imperio 
 
 amycus got up walked over to his sister picked up her wand then shuffled obediently to professor mcgonagall and handed it over along with his own then he lay down on the floor beside alecto professor mcgonagall waved her wand again and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the carrows binding them tightly together 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall turning to face him again with superb indifference to the carrows predicament if does indeed know that you are herec 
 
 as she said it a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through harry setting his scar on fire and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surfacec 
 
 potter are you all right said a voice and harry came back he was clutching lunas shoulder to steady himself 
 
 times running out voldemorts getting nearer professor im acting on dumbledores orders i must find what he wanted me to find but weve got to get the students out while im searching the castle c its me voldemort wants but he wont care about killing a few more or less not nowc not now he knows im attacking horcruxes harry finished the sentence in his head 
 
 youre acting on dumbledores orders she repeated with a look of dawning wonder then she drew herself up to her fullest height 
 
 we shall secure the school against while you search for this c this object 
 
 is that possible 
 
 i think so said professor mcgonagall dryly we teachers are rather good at magic you know i am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it of course something will have to be done about professor snapec 
 
 let me c 
 
 cand if hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege with the dark lord at the gates it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible with the floo network under observation and apparition impossible within the groundsc 
 
 theres a way said harry quickly and he explained about the passageway leading into the hogs head 
 
 potter were talking about hundreds of studentsc 
 
 i know professor but if voldemort and the death eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they wont be interested in anyone whos disapparating out of hogs head 
 
 theres something in that she agreed she pointed her wand at the carrows and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies tied itself around them and hoisted them into the air where they dangled beneath the ceiling like two large ugly sea creatures come we must alert the other heads of house youd better put that cloak back on 
 
 she marched toward the door and as she did so she raised her wand from the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes the patronuses ran sleekly ahead filling the spiral staircase with silvery light as professor mcgonagall harry and luna hurried back down 
 
 along the corridors they raced and one by one the patronuses left them professor mcgonagalls tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor and harry and luna jogged behind her under the cloak 
 
 they had descended two more floors when another set of quiet joined theirs harry whose scar was still prickling heard them first he felt in the pouch around his neck for the marauders map but before he could take it our mcgonagall too seemed to become aware of their company she halted raised her wand ready to duel and said whos there 
 
 it is i said a low voice 
 
 from behind a suit of armor stepped severus snape 
 
 hatred boiled up in harry at the sight of him he had forgotten the details of snapes appearance in the magnitude of his crimes forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face how his black eyes had a dead cold look he was not wearing nightclothes but was dressed in his usual black cloak and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight 
 
 where are the carrows he asked quietly 
 
 wherever you told them to be i expect severus said professor mcgonagall 
 
 snape stepped nearer and his eyes flitted over professor mcgonagall into the air around her as if he knew that harry was there harry held his wand up too ready to attack 
 
 i was under the impression said snape that alecto had apprehended an intruder 
 
 really said professor mcgonagall and what gave you that impression 
 
 snape mad a slight flexing movement of his left arm where the dark mark was branded into his skin 
 
 oh but naturally said professor mcgonagall you death eaters have your own private means of communication i forgot 
 
 snape pretended not to have heard her his eyes were still probing the air all about her and he was moving gradually closer with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing 
 
 i did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors minerva 
 
 you have some objection 
 
 i wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour 
 
 i thought i heard a disturbance said professor mcgonagall 
 
 really but all seems calm 
 
 snape looked into her eyes 
 
 have you seen harry potter minerva because if you have i must insistc 
 
 professor mcgonagall moved faster than harry could have believed her wand slashed through the air and for a split second harry thought that snape must crumple unconscious but the swiftness of his shield charm was such that mcgonagall was thrown off balance she brandished her wand at a touch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket harry about to curse snape was forced to pull luna out of the way of the descending flames which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at snapec then it was no longer fire but a great black serpent that mcgonagall blasted to smoke which and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him and with echoing clangs the daggers sank one after another into its breastc 
 
 minerva said a squeaky voice and looking behind him still shielding luna from flying spells harry saw professors flitwick and sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes with the enormous professor slughorn panting along at the rear 
 
 no squealed flitwick raising his wand youll do no more murder at hogwarts 
 
 flitwicks spell hit the suit of armor behind which snape had taken shelter with a clatter it came to life snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers harry and luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered when harry looked up again snape was in full flight mcgonagall flitwick and sprout all thundering after him he hurtled through a classroom door and moments later he heard mcgonagall cry coward coward 
 
 whats happened whats happened asked luna 
 
 harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor trailing the invisibility cloak behind them into the deserted classroom where professors mcgonagall flitwick and sprout were standing at a smashed window 
 
 he jumped said professor mcgonagall as harry and luna ran into the room 
 
 you mean hes dead harry sprinted to the window ignoring flitwicks and sprouts yells of shock at his sudden appearance 
 
 no hes not dead said mcgonagall bitterly unlike dumbledore he was still carrying a wand and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master 
 
 with a tingle of horror harry saw in the distance a huge bat like shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall 
 
 there were heavy footfalls behind them and a great deal of puffing slughorn had just caught up 
 
 harry he panted massaging his immense chest beneath his silk pajamas my dear boy what a surpriseminerva do please explainseveruswhat 
 
 our headmaster is taking a short break said professor mcgonagall pointing at the hole in the window 
 
 professor harry shouted his hand on his forehead he could see the lake sliding beneath him and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore and voldemort lept from it with murder in his heartc 
 
 professor weve got to barricade the school hes coming now 
 
 very well is coming she told the other teachers sprout and flitwick gasped slughorn let out a low groan potter has work to do in the castle on dumbledores orders we need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while potter does what he needs to do 
 
 you realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out indefinitely squeaked flitwick 
 
 but we can hold him up said professor sprout 
 
 thank you pomona said professor mcgonagall and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding 
 
 i suggest we establish basic protection around the place then gather our students and meet in the great hall most must be evacuated though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight i think they ought to be given the chance 
 
 agreed said professor sprout already hurrying toward the door i shall meet you in the great hall in twenty minutes with my house 
 
 and as she jogged out of sight they could hear her muttering tentacula devils snare and snargaluff podsyes id like to see the death eaters fighting those 
 
 i can act from here said flitwick and although he could barely see out of it he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity harry heard a weird rushing noise as though flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds 
 
 professor harry said approaching the little charms master professor im sorry to interrupt but this is important have you got any idea where the diadem of ravenclaw is 
 
 cprotego horribillis c the diadem of ravenclaw squeaked flitwick a little extra wisdom never goes amiss potter but i hardly think it would be much use in this situation 
 
 i only meant c do you know where it is have you ever seen it 
 
 seen it nobody has seen it in living memory long since lost boy 
 
 harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic what then was the horcrux 
 
 we shall meet you and your ravenclaws in the great hall filius said professor mcgonagall beckoning to harry and luna to follow her 
 
 they had just reached the door when slughorn rumbled into speech 
 
 my word he puffed pale and sweaty his walrus mustache aquiver what a im not at all sure whether this is wise minerva he is bound to find a way in you know and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous perilc 
 
 i shall expect you and the slytherins in the great hall in twenty minutes also said professor mcgonagall if you wish to leave with your students we shall not stop you but if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle then horace we duel to kill 
 
 minerva he said aghast 
 
 the time has come for slytherin house to decide upon its loyalties interrupted professor mcgonagall go and wake your students horace 
 
 harry did not stay to watch slughorn splutter he and luna stayed after professor mcgonagall who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand 
 
 piertotumcoh for heavens sake filch not nowc 
 
 the aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view shouting students out of bed students in the corridors 
 
 theyre supposed to be you blithering idiot shouted mcgonagall now go and do something constructive find peeves 
 
 stammered filch as though he had never heard the name before 
 
 yes peeves you fool peeves havent you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century go and fetch him at once 
 
 filch evidently thought professor mcgonagall had taken leave of her senses but hobbled away muttering under his breath 
 
 and now c piertotum locomator cried professor mcgonagall and all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same 
 
 hogwarts is threatened shouted professor mcgonagall man the boundaries protect us do your duty to our school 
 
 clattering and yelling the horde of moving statues stampeded past harry some of them smaller others larger than life there were animals too and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains 
 
 now potter said mcgonagall you and miss lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the great hall c i shall rouse the other gryffindors 
 
 they parted at the top of the next staircase harry and luna turning back toward the concealed entrance to the room of requirement as they ran they met crowds of students most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas being shepherded down to the great hall by teachers and prefects 
 
 that was potter 
 
 harry potter 
 
 it was him i swear i just saw him 
 
 but harry did not look back and at last they reached the entrance to the room of requirement harry leaned against the enchanted wall which opened to admit them and he and luna sped back down the steep staircase 
 
 whc 
 
 as the room came into view harry slipped down a few stairs in shock it was packed far more crowded than when he had last been in there kingsley and lupin were looking up at him as were oliver wood katie bell angelina johnson and alicia spinnet bill and fleur and mr and mrs weasley 
 
 harry whats happening said lupin meeting him at the foot of the stairs 
 
 voldemorts on his way theyre barricading he school c snapes run for it c what are you doing here how did you know 
 
 we sent messages to the rest of dumbledores army fred explained you couldnt expect everyone to miss the fun harry and the let the order of the phoenix know and it all kind of snowballed 
 
 what first harry called george whats going on 
 
 theyre evacuating the younger kids and everyones meeting in the great hall to get organized harry said were fighting 
 
 there was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs he was pressed back against he wall as they ran past hi the mingled members of the order of the phoenix dumbledores army and harrys old quidditch team all with their wands drawn heading up into the main castle 
 
 come on luna dean called as he passed holding out his free hand she took it and followed him back up the stairs 
 
 the crowd was thinning only a little knot of people remained below in the room of requirement and harry joined them mrs weasley was struggling with ginny around them stood lupin fred george bill and fleur 
 
 youre underage mrs weasley shouted at her daughter as harry approached i wont permit it the boys yes but you youve got to go home 
 
 i wont 
 
 ginnys hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mothers grip 
 
 im in dumbledores armyc 
 
 a teenagers gang 
 
 a teenagers gang thats about to take him on which no one else has dared to do said fred 
 
 shes sixteen shouted mrs weasley shes not old enough what you two were thinking bringing her with you c c 
 
 fred and george looked slightly ashamed of themselves 
 
 moms right ginny said bill gently you cant do this everyone underage will have to leave its only right 
 
 i cant go home ginny shouted angry tears sparkling in her eyes my whole familys here i cant stand waiting there alone and not knowing and c 
 
 her eyes met harrys for the first time she looked at him beseechingly but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly 
 
 fine she said staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the hogs head ill say now then andc 
 
 there was a scuffling and a great thump someone else had clambered out of the tunnel overbalanced slightly and fallen he pulled himself up no the nearest chair looked around through lopsided glasses and said am i too late has it started i only just found out so i c i c 
 
 percy spluttered into silence evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family there was a long moment of astonishment broken by fleur turning to lupin and saying in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension soc ow eez leetle teddy 
 
 lupin blinked at her startled the silence between the weasleys seemed to be solidifying like ice 
 
 i c oh yes c hes fine lupin said loudly yes tonks is with him c at her mothers c 
 
 percy and the other weasleys were still staring at one another frozen 
 
 here ive got a picture lupin shouted pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to fleur and harry who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair waving fat fists at the camera 
 
 i was a fool percy roared so loudly that lupin nearly dropped his photograph i was an idiot i was a pompous prat i was a c a c 
 
 moron said fred 
 
 percy swallowed 
 
 yes i was 
 
 well you cant say fairer than that said fred holding his hand out to percy 
 
 mrs weasley burst into tears she ran forward pushed fred aside and pulled percy into a strangling hug while he patted her on the back his eyes on his father 
 
 im sorry dad percy said 
 
 mr weasley blinked rather rapidly then he too hurried to hug his son 
 
 what made you see sense perce inquired george 
 
 its been coming on for a while said percy mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak but i had to find a way out and its not so easy at the ministry theyre imprisoning traitors all the time i managed to make contact with aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that hogwarts was going to make a fight of it so here i am 
 
 well we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these said george in a good imitation of percys most pompous manner now lets get upstairs and fight or all the good death eatersll be taken 
 
 so youre my sister now said percy shaking hands with fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with bill fred and george 
 
 ginny barked mrs weasley 
 
 ginny had been attempting under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs too 
 
 molly how about this said lupin why doesnt ginny stay here then at least shell be on the scene and know whats going on but she wont be in the middle of the fighting 
 
 ic 
 
 thats a good idea said mr weasley firmly ginny you stay in this room you hear me 
 
 ginny did not seem to like the idea much but under her fathers unusually stern gaze she nodded mr and mrs weasley and lupin headed off to the stairs as well 
 
 wheres ron asked harry wheres hermione 
 
 they must have gone up the great hall already mr weasley called over his shoulder 
 
 i didnt see them pass me said harry 
 
 they said something about a bathroom said ginny not long after you left 
 
 a bathroom 
 
 harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the room of requirement and checked the bathroom beyond it was empty 
 
 youre sure they said bathc 
 
 but then his scar seared and the room of vanished he was looking through the high gates with winged boats on pillars at either side looking through the dark grounds toward the castle which was ablaze with lights nagini lay draped over his shoulders he was possessed of that cold cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 soup from a sausage skewer 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we had such an excellent dinner yesterday said an old mouse 
 of the female sex to another who had not been present at the feast i 
 sat number below the which was not a bad place 
 
 shall i tell you what we had everything was first rate mouldy bread 
 tallow candle and sausage and then when we had finished that 
 course the same came on all over again it was as good as two feasts 
 
 we were very sociable and there was as much joking and fun as if we had been all of one family circle nothing was left but the sausage 
 skewers and this formed a subject of conversation till at last it 
 turned to the proverb soup from sausage skins or as the people in 
 the neighboring country call it soup from a sausage skewer every 
 one had heard the proverb but no one had ever tasted the soup much less prepared it a capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the 
 soup and some one said he ought to be made a relieving officer to the poor was not that witty then the old rose and promised that the young who should learn how best to prepare this and savory soup should be his queen and a year and a day should be allowed for the purpose 
 
 that was not at all a bad proposal said the other mouse but 
 how is the soup made 
 
 ah that is more than i can tell you all the young lady mice 
 were asking the same question they wished very much to be queen 
 but they did not want to take the trouble of going out into the 
 world to learn how to make soup which was absolutely necessary to 
 be done first but it is not every one who would care to leave her 
 family or her happy corner by the at home even to be 
 made queen it is not always easy to find bacon and in 
 foreign lands every day and it is not pleasant to have to endure 
 hunger and be perhaps after all eaten up alive by the cat 
 
 most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged the 
 majority from going out into the world to collect the required 
 information only four mice gave notice that they were ready to set 
 out on the journey they were young and lively but poor each of them wished to visit one of the four divisions of the world so that it 
 might be seen which was the most favored by fortune every one took a sausage skewer as a staff and to remind them of the 
 object of their journey they left home early in may and none of them returned till the first of may in the following year and then only 
 three of them nothing was seen or heard of the fourth although the 
 day of decision was close at hand ah yes there is always some 
 trouble mixed up with the greatest pleasure said the but 
 he gave orders that all the mice within a circle of many miles 
 should be invited at once they were to assemble in the kitchen and 
 the three travelled mice were to stand in a row before them while a 
 sausage skewer covered with crape was to be stuck up instead of 
 the missing mouse no one dared to express an opinion until the king 
 spoke and desired one of them to go on with her story and now we 
 shall hear what she said 
 
 what the first little mouse 
 saw and heard on her travels 
 when i first went out into the world said the little mouse 
 i fancied as so many of my age do that i already knew everything 
 but it was not so it takes years to acquire great knowledge i went 
 at once to sea in a ship bound for the north i had been told that the 
 cook must know how to prepare every dish at sea and it is easy enough to do that with plenty of sides of bacon and large tubs of salt meat and mouldy flour there i found plenty of delicate food but no opportunity for learning how to make soup from a sausage skewer we sailed on for many days and nights the ship rocked fearfully and we did not escape without a wetting as soon as we arrived at the port to which the ship was bound i left it and went on shore at a place far towards the north it is a wonderful thing to leave your own little corner at home to hide yourself in a ship where there are sure to be some nice snug corners for shelter then suddenly to find yourself thousands of miles away in a foreign land i saw large 
 pathless forests of pine and birch trees which smelt so strong that i 
 sneezed and thought of sausage there were great lakes also which 
 looked as black as ink at a distance but were quite clear when i came 
 close to them large swans were floating upon them and i thought at 
 first they were only foam they lay so still but when i saw them walk 
 and fly i knew what they were directly they belong to the goose 
 species one can see that by their walk no one can attempt to 
 disguise family descent i kept with my own kind and associated 
 with the forest and field mice who however knew very little 
 especially about what i wanted to know and which had actually made me travel abroad the idea that soup could be made from a sausage 
 skewer was to them such an unlikely thought that it 
 was repeated from one to another through the whole forest they 
 declared that the problem would never be solved that the thing was an impossibility how little i thought that in this place on the very 
 first night i should be initiated into the manner of its preparation 
 it was the height of summer which the mice told me was the 
 reason that the forest smelt so strong and that the herbs were so 
 fragrant and the lakes with the white swimming swans so dark and yet so clear on the margin of the wood near to three or four houses a pole as large as the mainmast of a ship had been erected and from 
 the summit hung wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons it was 
 the maypole lads and lasses danced round the pole and tried to outdo the violins of the musicians with their singing they were as merry as ever at sunset and in the moonlight but i took no part in the 
 what has a little mouse to do with a maypole dance i 
 sat in the soft moss and held my sausage skewer tight the moon threw its beams particularly on one spot where stood a tree covered with exceedingly fine moss i may almost venture to say that it was as fine and soft as the fur of the but it was green which is a 
 color very agreeable to the eye all at once i saw the most charming 
 little people marching towards me they did not reach higher than my 
 knee they looked like human beings but were better proportioned and they called themselves elves their clothes were very delicate and 
 fine for they were made of the leaves of flowers trimmed with the 
 wings of flies and gnats which had not a bad effect by their manner 
 it appeared as if they were seeking for something i knew not what 
 till at last one of them espied me and came towards me and the 
 foremost pointed to my sausage skewer and said there that is 
 just what we want see it is pointed at the top is it not capital and the longer he looked at my staff the more delighted he became i will lend it to you said i but not to keep 
 
 oh no we keep it they all cried and then they seized 
 the skewer which i gave up to them and danced with it to the spot 
 where the delicate moss grew and set it up in the middle of the 
 green they wanted a maypole and the one they now had seemed cut 
 out on purpose for them then they decorated it so beautifully that it 
 was quite dazzling to look at little spiders spun golden threads 
 around it and then it was hung with fluttering veils and flags so 
 delicately white that they glittered like snow in the moonshine after 
 that they took colors from the wing and sprinkled them 
 over the white drapery which gleamed as if covered with flowers and 
 diamonds so that i could not recognize my sausage skewer at all 
 such a maypole had never been seen in all the world as this then came a great company of real elves nothing could be finer than their 
 clothes and they invited me to be present at the feast but i was 
 to keep at a certain distance because i was too large for them 
 
 then commenced such music that it sounded like a thousand glass bells and was so full and strong that i thought it must be the song of the swans i fancied also that i heard the voices of the cuckoo and the 
 and it seemed at last as if the whole forest sent forth 
 glorious melodies the voices of children the tinkling of bells 
 and the songs of the birds and all this wonderful melody came from 
 the elfin maypole my sausage peg was a complete peal of bells i 
 could scarcely believe that so much could have been produced from 
 it till i remembered into what hands it had fallen i was so much 
 affected that i wept tears such as a little mouse can weep but they 
 were tears of joy the night was far too short for me there are no 
 long nights there in summer as we often have in this part of the 
 world when the morning dawned and the gentle breeze rippled the 
 glassy mirror of the forest lake all the delicate veils and flags 
 fluttered away into thin air the waving garlands of the web 
 the hanging bridges and galleries or whatever else they may be 
 called vanished away as if they had never been six elves brought 
 me back my sausage skewer and at the same time asked me to make any request which they would grant if in their power so i begged them if they could to tell me how to make soup from a sausage skewer 
 
 how do we make it said the chief of the elves with a smile 
 
 why you have just seen it you scarcely knew your sausage skewer 
 again i am sure 
 
 they think themselves very wise thought i to myself then i told 
 them all about it and why i had travelled so far and also what 
 promise had been made at home to the one who should discover the 
 method of preparing this soup what use will it be i asked to the 
 or to our whole mighty kingdom that i have seen all these 
 beautiful things i cannot shake the sausage peg and say look here 
 is the skewer and now the soup will come that would only produce a dish to be served when people were keeping a fast 
 
 then the elf dipped his finger into the cup of a violet and said 
 to me look here i will anoint your staff so that when 
 you return to your own home and enter the castle you have only to touch the king with your staff and violets will spring forth and 
 cover the whole of it even in the coldest winter time so i think i 
 have given you really something to carry home and a little more 
 than something 
 
 but before the little mouse explained what this something more 
 was she stretched her staff out to the king and as it touched him 
 the most beautiful bunch of violets sprang forth and filled the 
 place with perfume the smell was so powerful that the 
 ordered the mice who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their tails 
 into the fire that there might be a smell of burning for the perfume 
 of the violets was overpowering and not the sort of scent that 
 every one liked 
 
 but what was the something more of which you spoke just now 
 asked the 
 
 why answered the little mouse i think it is what they call 
 effect and thereupon she turned the staff round and behold not 
 a single flower was to be seen upon it she now only held the naked 
 skewer and lifted it up as a conductor lifts his baton at a 
 concert violets the elf told me continued the mouse are for the 
 sight the smell and the touch so we have only now to produce the 
 effect of hearing and tasting and then as the little mouse beat 
 time with her staff there came sounds of music not such music as was heard in the forest at the elfin feast but such as is often heard in 
 the kitchen the sounds of boiling and roasting it came quite 
 suddenly like wind rushing through the chimneys and seemed as if 
 every pot and kettle were boiling over the clattered down 
 on the brass fender and then quite as suddenly all was still 
 nothing could be heard but the light vapory song of the 
 which was quite wonderful to hear for no one could rightly 
 distinguish whether the kettle was just beginning to boil or going 
 to stop and the little pot steamed and the great pot simmered but 
 without any regard for each indeed there seemed no sense in the 
 pots at all and as the little mouse waved her baton still more 
 wildly the pots foamed and threw up bubbles and boiled over while 
 again the wind roared and whistled through the chimney and at last 
 there was such a terrible hubbub that the little mouse let her 
 stick fall 
 
 that is a strange sort of soup said the shall we 
 not now hear about the preparation 
 
 that is all answered the little mouse with a bow 
 
 that all said the then we shall be glad to hear 
 what information the next may have to give us 
 
 what the second mouse had to tell 
 i was born in the library at a castle said the second mouse 
 very few members of our family ever had the good fortune to get 
 into the much less the on my journey and 
 here are the only times i have ever seen a kitchen we were 
 often obliged to suffer hunger in the library but then we gained a 
 great deal of knowledge the rumor reached us of the royal prize 
 offered to those who should be able to make soup from a sausage 
 skewer then my old grandmother sought out a manuscript which 
 however she could not read but had heard it read and in it was 
 written those who are poets can make soup of sausage skewers 
 she then asked me if i was a poet i felt myself quite innocent of any 
 such pretensions then she said i must go out and make myself a 
 poet i asked again what i should be required to do for it seemed 
 to me quite as difficult as to find out how to make soup of a 
 sausage skewer my grandmother had heard a great deal of reading in 
 her day and she told me three principal qualifications were 
 necessary understanding imagination and feeling if you can manage to acquire these three you will be a poet and the soup will be quite easy to you 
 
 so i went forth into the world and turned my steps towards the 
 west that i might become a poet understanding is the most 
 important matter in everything i knew that for the two other 
 qualifications are not thought much of so i went first to seek for 
 understanding where was i to find it go to the ant and learn 
 wisdom said the great jewish king i knew that from living in a 
 library so i went straight on till i came to the first great 
 and then i set myself to watch that i might become wise 
 the ants are a very respectable people they are wisdom itself all 
 they do is like the working of a sum in arithmetic which comes right 
 to work and to lay eggs say they and to provide for posterity 
 is to live out your time properly and that they truly do they are 
 divided into the clean and the dirty ants their rank is pointed out 
 by a number and the is number one and her opinion is the only correct one on everything she seems to have the whole wisdom of the world in her which was just the important matter i wished to acquire she said a great deal which was no doubt very clever yet to me it sounded like nonsense she said the was the loftiest thing in the world and yet close to the mound stood a tall tree which no one could deny was loftier much loftier but no mention was made of the tree one evening an ant lost herself on this tree she had crept up the stem not nearly to the top but higher than 
 any ant had ever ventured and when at last she returned home she said that she had found something in her travels much higher than the 
 the rest of the ants considered this an insult to the 
 whole community so she was condemned to wear a muzzle and to live in perpetual solitude a short time afterwards another ant got on 
 the tree and made the same journey and the same discovery but she 
 spoke of it cautiously and indefinitely and as she was one of the 
 superior ants and very much respected they believed her and when she died they erected an eggshell as a monument to her memory for they cultivated a great respect for science i saw said the little mouse that the ants were always running to and fro with her burdens on their backs once i saw one of them drop her load she gave herself a great deal of trouble in trying to raise it again but she could not succeed then two others came up and tried with all their strength 
 to help her till they nearly dropped their own burdens in doing so 
 then they were obliged to stop for a moment in their help for every 
 one must think of himself first and the remarked that their 
 conduct that day showed that they possessed kind hearts and good 
 understanding these two qualities she continued place us ants in 
 the highest degree above all other reasonable beings understanding 
 must therefore be seen among us in the most prominent manner and my wisdom is greater than all and so saying she raised herself on her two hind legs that no one else might be mistaken for her i could not therefore make an error so i ate her up we are to go to the ants 
 to learn wisdom and i had got the queen 
 
 i now turned and went nearer to the lofty tree already mentioned 
 which was an oak it had a tall trunk with a top and 
 was very old i knew that a living being dwelt here a dryad as she is 
 called who is born with the tree and dies with it i had heard this 
 in the library and here was just such a tree and in it an she uttered a terrible scream when she caught sight of me so near to her like many women she was very much afraid of mice and she had more real cause for fear than they have for i might have gnawed through the tree on which her life depended i spoke to her in a kind and friendly manner and begged her to take courage 
 
 at last she took me up in her delicate hand and then i told her 
 what had brought me out into the world and she promised me that 
 perhaps on that very evening she should be able to obtain for me one 
 of the two treasures for which i was seeking she told me that 
 phantaesus was her very dear friend that he was as beautiful as the 
 god of love that he remained often for many hours with her under 
 the leafy boughs of the tree which then rustled and waved more than 
 ever over them both he called her his dryad she said and the tree 
 his tree for the grand old oak with its gnarled trunk was just to 
 his taste the root spreading deep into the earth the top rising 
 high in the fresh air knew the value of the drifted snow the keen 
 wind and the warm sunshine as it ought to be known yes continued the dryad the birds sing up above in the branches and talk to each other about the beautiful fields they have visited in foreign 
 lands and on one of the withered boughs a stork has built his 
 nest it is beautifully arranged and besides it is pleasant to 
 hear a little about the land of the pyramids all this pleases 
 phantaesus but it is not enough for him i am obliged to relate to 
 him of my life in the woods and to go back to my childhood when i 
 was little and the tree so small and delicate that a could overshadow it and i have to tell everything that has happened since then till now that the tree is so large and strong sit you down now under the green bindwood and pay attention when phantaesus comes i will find an opportunity to lay hold of his wing and to pull out one of the little feathers that feather you shall have a better was never given to any poet it will be quite enough for you 
 
 and when phantaesus came the feather was plucked and said 
 the little mouse i seized and put it in water and kept it there 
 till it was quite soft it was very heavy and indigestible but i 
 managed to nibble it up at last it is not so easy to nibble 
 self into a poet there are so many things to get through now 
 however i had two of them understanding and imagination and through these i knew that the third was to be found in the library a great man has said and written that there are novels whose sole and only use appeared to be that they might relieve mankind of overflowing tears a kind of sponge in fact for sucking up feelings and emotions i remembered a few of these books they had always appeared tempting to the appetite they had been much read and were so greasy that they must have absorbed no end of emotions in themselves i retraced my steps to the library and literally devoured a whole novel that is properly speaking the interior or soft part of it the crust or binding i left when i had digested not only this but a second i felt a stirring within me then i ate a small piece of a third 
 romance and felt myself a poet i said it to myself and told others the same i had and and i cannot tell what 
 aches besides i thought over all the stories that may be said to be 
 connected with sausage pegs and all that has ever been written 
 about skewers and sticks and staves and splinters came to my 
 thoughts the must have had a wonderfully clear 
 understanding i remembered the man who placed a white stick in his 
 mouth by which he could make himself and the stick invisible i 
 thought of sticks as staves of music or rhyme of 
 breaking a stick over a back and heaven knows how many more phrases of the same sort relating to sticks staves and skewers 
 
 all my thoughts rein on skewers sticks of wood and staves and as 
 i am at last a poet and i have worked terribly hard to make 
 myself one i can of course make poetry on anything i shall therefore 
 be able to wait upon you every day in the week with a poetical history 
 of a skewer and that is my soup 
 
 in that case said the we will hear what the 
 third mouse has to say 
 
 squeak squeak cried a little mouse at the kitchen door it was 
 the fourth and not the third of the four who were contending for the 
 prize one whom the rest supposed to be dead she shot in like an 
 arrow and overturned the sausage peg that had been covered with 
 crape she had been running day and night she had watched an 
 opportunity to get into a goods train and had travelled by the 
 railway and yet she had arrived almost too late she pressed forward 
 looking very much ruffled she had lost her sausage skewer but not 
 her voice for she began to speak at once as if they only waited for 
 her and would hear her only and as if nothing else in the world 
 was of the least consequence she spoke out so clearly and plainly 
 and she had come in so suddenly that no one had time to stop her or 
 to say a word while she was speaking and now let us hear what she 
 said 
 
 what the fourth mouse who spoke 
 before the third had to tell 
 i started off at once to the largest town said she but the 
 name of it has escaped me i have a very bad memory for names i was carried from the railway with some forfeited goods to the jail 
 and on arriving i made my escape and ran into the house of the 
 turnkey the turnkey was speaking of his prisoners especially of 
 one who had uttered thoughtless words these words had given rise to other words and at length they were written down and registered 
 the whole affair is like making soup of sausage skewers said he but the soup may cost him his neck 
 
 now this raised in me an interest for the prisoner continued 
 the little mouse and i watched my opportunity and slipped into 
 his apartment for there is a to be found behind every 
 closed door the prisoner looked pale he had a great beard and large sparkling eyes there was a lamp burning but the walls were so 
 black that they only looked the blacker for it the prisoner scratched 
 pictures and verses with white chalk on the black walls but i did not 
 read the verses i think he found his confinement wearisome so that i 
 was a welcome guest he enticed me with with 
 whistling and with gentle words and seemed so friendly towards me 
 that by degrees i gained confidence in him and we became friends 
 he divided his bread and water with me gave me cheese and sausage 
 and i really began to love him altogether i must own that it was a 
 very pleasant intimacy he let me run about on his hand and on his 
 arm and into his sleeve and i even crept into his beard and he 
 called me his little friend i forgot what i had come out into the 
 world for forgot my sausage skewer which i had laid in a crack in the 
 floor it is lying there still i wished to stay with him always where 
 i was for i knew that if i went away the poor prisoner would have 
 no one to be his friend which is a sad thing i stayed but he did 
 not he spoke to me so mournfully for the last time gave me double as much bread and cheese as usual and kissed his hand to me then he went away and never came back i know nothing more of his history 
 
 the jailer took possession of me now he said something about 
 soup from a sausage skewer but i could not trust him he took me in 
 his hand certainly but it was to place me in a cage like a oh how dreadful it was i had to run round and round without getting any farther in advance and only to make everybody laugh the was a charming little thing she had curly hair like the brightest gold merry eyes and such a smiling mouth 
 
 you poor little mouse said she one day as she peeped into 
 my cage i will set you free she then drew forth the iron 
 fastening and i sprang out on the and from thence to the 
 roof free free that was all i could think of not of the object 
 of my journey it grew dark and as night was coming on i found a 
 lodging in an old tower where dwelt a watchman and an owl i had no confidence in either of them least of all in the owl which is like a 
 cat and has a great failing for she eats mice one may however be 
 mistaken sometimes and so was i for this was a respectable and 
 old owl who knew more than the watchman and even as much as i did myself the young owls made a great fuss about 
 everything but the only rough words she would say to them were 
 you had better go and make some soup from sausage skewers she was very indulgent and loving to her children her conduct gave me such confidence in her that from the crack where i sat i called out 
 squeak this confidence of mine pleased her so much that she assured me she would take me under her own protection and that not a creature should do me harm the fact was she wickedly meant to keep me in reserve for her own eating in winter when food would be scarce yet she was a very clever she explained to me that the watchman could only hoot with the horn that hung loose at his side and then she said he is so terribly proud of it that he imagines 
 himself an owl in the tower wants to do great things but only 
 succeeds in small all soup on a sausage skewer then i begged the owl to give me the recipe for this soup soup from a sausage skewer said she is only a proverb amongst mankind and may be understood in many ways each believes his own way the best and after all the proverb signifies nothing nothing i exclaimed i was quite struck truth is not always agreeable but truth is above everything else as the old owl said i thought over all this and saw quite plainly that if truth was really so far above everything else it must be much more valuable than soup from a sausage skewer so i hastened to get away that i might be home in time and bring what was highest and best and above everything namely the truth the mice are an enlightened people and the is above them all he is therefore capable of making me queen for the sake of truth 
 
 your truth is a falsehood said the mouse who had not yet 
 spoken i can prepare the soup and i mean to do so 
 
 how it was prepared 
 i did not travel said the third mouse i stayed in this 
 country that was the right way one gains nothing by travelling 
 everything can be acquired here quite as easily so i stayed at 
 home i have not obtained what i know from supernatural beings i have neither swallowed it nor learnt it from conversing with owls i 
 have got it all from my reflections and thoughts will you now set the 
 kettle on the fire so now pour the water in quite full up to the 
 brim place it on the fire make up a good blaze keep it burning 
 that the water may boil it must boil over and over there now i 
 throw in the skewer will the be pleased now to dip his 
 tail into the boiling water and stir it round with the tail the 
 longer the king stirs it the stronger the soup will become nothing 
 more is necessary only to stir it 
 
 can no one else do this asked the king 
 
 no said the mouse only in the tail of the is 
 this power contained 
 
 and the water boiled and bubbled as the stood close 
 beside the kettle it seemed rather a dangerous performance but he 
 turned round and put out his tail as mice do in a dairy when they 
 wish to skim the cream from a pan of milk with their tails and 
 afterwards lick it off but the mous

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 soup from a sausage skewer 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we had such an excellent dinner yesterday said an old mouse 
 of the female sex to another who had not been present at the feast i 
 sat number below the which was not a bad place 
 
 shall i tell you what we had everything was first rate mouldy bread 
 tallow candle and sausage and then when we had finished that 
 course the same came on all over again it was as good as two feasts 
 
 we were very sociable and there was as much joking and fun as if we had been all of one family circle nothing was left but the sausage 
 skewers and this formed a subject of conversation till at last it 
 turned to the proverb soup from sausage skins or as the people in 
 the neighboring country call it soup from a sausage skewer every 
 one had heard the proverb but no one had ever tasted the soup much less prepared it a capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the 
 soup and some one said he ought to be made a relieving officer to the poor was not that witty then the old rose and promised that the young who should learn how best to prepare this and savory soup should be his queen and a year and a day should be allowed for the purpose 
 
 that was not at all a bad proposal said the other mouse but 
 how is the soup made 
 
 ah that is more than i can tell you all the young lady mice 
 were asking the same question they wished very much to be queen 
 but they did not want to take the trouble of going out into the 
 world to learn how to make soup which was absolutely necessary to 
 be done first but it is not every one who would care to leave her 
 family or her happy corner by the at home even to be 
 made queen it is not always easy to find bacon and in 
 foreign lands every day and it is not pleasant to have to endure 
 hunger and be perhaps after all eaten up alive by the cat 
 
 most probably some such thoughts as these discouraged the 
 majority from going out into the world to collect the required 
 information only four mice gave notice that they were ready to set 
 out on the journey they were young and lively but poor each of them wished to visit one of the four divisions of the world so that it 
 might be seen which was the most favored by fortune every one took a sausage skewer as a staff and to remind them of the 
 object of their journey they left home early in may and none of them returned till the first of may in the following year and then only 
 three of them nothing was seen or heard of the fourth although the 
 day of decision was close at hand ah yes there is always some 
 trouble mixed up with the greatest pleasure said the but 
 he gave orders that all the mice within a circle of many miles 
 should be invited at once they were to assemble in the kitchen and 
 the three travelled mice were to stand in a row before them while a 
 sausage skewer covered with crape was to be stuck up instead of 
 the missing mouse no one dared to express an opinion until the king 
 spoke and desired one of them to go on with her story and now we 
 shall hear what she said 
 
 what the first little mouse 
 saw and heard on her travels 
 when i first went out into the world said the little mouse 
 i fancied as so many of my age do that i already knew everything 
 but it was not so it takes years to acquire great knowledge i went 
 at once to sea in a ship bound for the north i had been told that the 
 cook must know how to prepare every dish at sea and it is easy enough to do that with plenty of sides of bacon and large tubs of salt meat and mouldy flour there i found plenty of delicate food but no opportunity for learning how to make soup from a sausage skewer we sailed on for many days and nights the ship rocked fearfully and we did not escape without a wetting as soon as we arrived at the port to which the ship was bound i left it and went on shore at a place far towards the north it is a wonderful thing to leave your own little corner at home to hide yourself in a ship where there are sure to be some nice snug corners for shelter then suddenly to find yourself thousands of miles away in a foreign land i saw large 
 pathless forests of pine and birch trees which smelt so strong that i 
 sneezed and thought of sausage there were great lakes also which 
 looked as black as ink at a distance but were quite clear when i came 
 close to them large swans were floating upon them and i thought at 
 first they were only foam they lay so still but when i saw them walk 
 and fly i knew what they were directly they belong to the goose 
 species one can see that by their walk no one can attempt to 
 disguise family descent i kept with my own kind and associated 
 with the forest and field mice who however knew very little 
 especially about what i wanted to know and which had actually made me travel abroad the idea that soup could be made from a sausage 
 skewer was to them such an unlikely thought that it 
 was repeated from one to another through the whole forest they 
 declared that the problem would never be solved that the thing was an impossibility how little i thought that in this place on the very 
 first night i should be initiated into the manner of its preparation 
 it was the height of summer which the mice told me was the 
 reason that the forest smelt so strong and that the herbs were so 
 fragrant and the lakes with the white swimming swans so dark and yet so clear on the margin of the wood near to three or four houses a pole as large as the mainmast of a ship had been erected and from 
 the summit hung wreaths of flowers and fluttering ribbons it was 
 the maypole lads and lasses danced round the pole and tried to outdo the violins of the musicians with their singing they were as merry as ever at sunset and in the moonlight but i took no part in the 
 what has a little mouse to do with a maypole dance i 
 sat in the soft moss and held my sausage skewer tight the moon threw its beams particularly on one spot where stood a tree covered with exceedingly fine moss i may almost venture to say that it was as fine and soft as the fur of the but it was green which is a 
 color very agreeable to the eye all at once i saw the most charming 
 little people marching towards me they did not reach higher than my 
 knee they looked like human beings but were better proportioned and they called themselves elves their clothes were very delicate and 
 fine for they were made of the leaves of flowers trimmed with the 
 wings of flies and gnats which had not a bad effect by their manner 
 it appeared as if they were seeking for something i knew not what 
 till at last one of them espied me and came towards me and the 
 foremost pointed to my sausage skewer and said there that is 
 just what we want see it is pointed at the top is it not capital and the longer he looked at my staff the more delighted he became i will lend it to you said i but not to keep 
 
 oh no we keep it they all cried and then they seized 
 the skewer which i gave up to them and danced with it to the spot 
 where the delicate moss grew and set it up in the middle of the 
 green they wanted a maypole and the one they now had seemed cut 
 out on purpose for them then they decorated it so beautifully that it 
 was quite dazzling to look at little spiders spun golden threads 
 around it and then it was hung with fluttering veils and flags so 
 delicately white that they glittered like snow in the moonshine after 
 that they took colors from the wing and sprinkled them 
 over the white drapery which gleamed as if covered with flowers and 
 diamonds so that i could not recognize my sausage skewer at all 
 such a maypole had never been seen in all the world as this then came a great company of real elves nothing could be finer than their 
 clothes and they invited me to be present at the feast but i was 
 to keep at a certain distance because i was too large for them 
 
 then commenced such music that it sounded like a thousand glass bells and was so full and strong that i thought it must be the song of the swans i fancied also that i heard the voices of the cuckoo and the 
 and it seemed at last as if the whole forest sent forth 
 glorious melodies the voices of children the tinkling of bells 
 and the songs of the birds and all this wonderful melody came from 
 the elfin maypole my sausage peg was a complete peal of bells i 
 could scarcely believe that so much could have been produced from 
 it till i remembered into what hands it had fallen i was so much 
 affected that i wept tears such as a little mouse can weep but they 
 were tears of joy the night was far too short for me there are no 
 long nights there in summer as we often have in this part of the 
 world when the morning dawned and the gentle breeze rippled the 
 glassy mirror of the forest lake all the delicate veils and flags 
 fluttered away into thin air the waving garlands of the web 
 the hanging bridges and galleries or whatever else they may be 
 called vanished away as if they had never been six elves brought 
 me back my sausage skewer and at the same time asked me to make any request which they would grant if in their power so i begged them if they could to tell me how to make soup from a sausage skewer 
 
 how do we make it said the chief of the elves with a smile 
 
 why you have just seen it you scarcely knew your sausage skewer 
 again i am sure 
 
 they think themselves very wise thought i to myself then i told 
 them all about it and why i had travelled so far and also what 
 promise had been made at home to the one who should discover the 
 method of preparing this soup what use will it be i asked to the 
 or to our whole mighty kingdom that i have seen all these 
 beautiful things i cannot shake the sausage peg and say look here 
 is the skewer and now the soup will come that would only produce a dish to be served when people were keeping a fast 
 
 then the elf dipped his finger into the cup of a violet and said 
 to me look here i will anoint your staff so that when 
 you return to your own home and enter the castle you have only to touch the king with your staff and violets will spring forth and 
 cover the whole of it even in the coldest winter time so i think i 
 have given you really something to carry home and a little more 
 than something 
 
 but before the little mouse explained what this something more 
 was she stretched her staff out to the king and as it touched him 
 the most beautiful bunch of violets sprang forth and filled the 
 place with perfume the smell was so powerful that the 
 ordered the mice who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their tails 
 into the fire that there might be a smell of burning for the perfume 
 of the violets was overpowering and not the sort of scent that 
 every one liked 
 
 but what was the something more of which you spoke just now 
 asked the 
 
 why answered the little mouse i think it is what they call 
 effect and thereupon she turned the staff round and behold not 
 a single flower was to be seen upon it she now only held the naked 
 skewer and lifted it up as a conductor lifts his baton at a 
 concert violets the elf told me continued the mouse are for the 
 sight the smell and the touch so we have only now to produce the 
 effect of hearing and tasting and then as the little mouse beat 
 time with her staff there came sounds of music not such music as was heard in the forest at the elfin feast but such as is often heard in 
 the kitchen the sounds of boiling and roasting it came quite 
 suddenly like wind rushing through the chimneys and seemed as if 
 every pot and kettle were boiling over the clattered down 
 on the brass fender and then quite as suddenly all was still 
 nothing could be heard but the light vapory song of the 
 which was quite wonderful to hear for no one could rightly 
 distinguish whether the kettle was just beginning to boil or going 
 to stop and the little pot steamed and the great pot simmered but 
 without any regard for each indeed there seemed no sense in the 
 pots at all and as the little mouse waved her baton still more 
 wildly the pots foamed and threw up bubbles and boiled over while 
 again the wind roared and whistled through the chimney and at last 
 there was such a terrible hubbub that the little mouse let her 
 stick fall 
 
 that is a strange sort of soup said the shall we 
 not now hear about the preparation 
 
 that is all answered the little mouse with a bow 
 
 that all said the then we shall be glad to hear 
 what information the next may have to give us 
 
 what the second mouse had to tell 
 i was born in the library at a castle said the second mouse 
 very few members of our family ever had the good fortune to get 
 into the much less the on my journey and 
 here are the only times i have ever seen a kitchen we were 
 often obliged to suffer hunger in the library but then we gained a 
 great deal of knowledge the rumor reached us of the royal prize 
 offered to those who should be able to make soup from a sausage 
 skewer then my old grandmother sought out a manuscript which 
 however she could not read but had heard it read and in it was 
 written those who are poets can make soup of sausage skewers 
 she then asked me if i was a poet i felt myself quite innocent of any 
 such pretensions then she said i must go out and make myself a 
 poet i asked again what i should be required to do for it seemed 
 to me quite as difficult as to find out how to make soup of a 
 sausage skewer my grandmother had heard a great deal of reading in 
 her day and she told me three principal qualifications were 
 necessary understanding imagination and feeling if you can manage to acquire these three you will be a poet and the soup will be quite easy to you 
 
 so i went forth into the world and turned my steps towards the 
 west that i might become a poet understanding is the most 
 important matter in everything i knew that for the two other 
 qualifications are not thought much of so i went first to seek for 
 understanding where was i to find it go to the ant and learn 
 wisdom said the great jewish king i knew that from living in a 
 library so i went straight on till i came to the first great 
 and then i set myself to watch that i might become wise 
 the ants are a very respectable people they are wisdom itself all 
 they do is like the working of a sum in arithmetic which comes right 
 to work and to lay eggs say they and to provide for posterity 
 is to live out your time properly and that they truly do they are 
 divided into the clean and the dirty ants their rank is pointed out 
 by a number and the is number one and her opinion is the only correct one on everything she seems to have the whole wisdom of the world in her which was just the important matter i wished to acquire she said a great deal which was no doubt very clever yet to me it sounded like nonsense she said the was the loftiest thing in the world and yet close to the mound stood a tall tree which no one could deny was loftier much loftier but no mention was made of the tree one evening an ant lost herself on this tree she had crept up the stem not nearly to the top but higher than 
 any ant had ever ventured and when at last she returned home she said that she had found something in her travels much higher than the 
 the rest of the ants considered this an insult to the 
 whole community so she was condemned to wear a muzzle and to live in perpetual solitude a short time afterwards another ant got on 
 the tree and made the same journey and the same discovery but she 
 spoke of it cautiously and indefinitely and as she was one of the 
 superior ants and very much respected they believed her and when she died they erected an eggshell as a monument to her memory for they cultivated a great respect for science i saw said the little mouse that the ants were always running to and fro with her burdens on their backs once i saw one of them drop her load she gave herself a great deal of trouble in trying to raise it again but she could not succeed then two others came up and tried with all their strength 
 to help her till they nearly dropped their own burdens in doing so 
 then they were obliged to stop for a moment in their help for every 
 one must think of himself first and the remarked that their 
 conduct that day showed that they possessed kind hearts and good 
 understanding these two qualities she continued place us ants in 
 the highest degree above all other reasonable beings understanding 
 must therefore be seen among us in the most prominent manner and my wisdom is greater than all and so saying she raised herself on her two hind legs that no one else might be mistaken for her i could not therefore make an error so i ate her up we are to go to the ants 
 to learn wisdom and i had got the queen 
 
 i now turned and went nearer to the lofty tree already mentioned 
 which was an oak it had a tall trunk with a top and 
 was very old i knew that a living being dwelt here a dryad as she is 
 called who is born with the tree and dies with it i had heard this 
 in the library and here was just such a tree and in it an she uttered a terrible scream when she caught sight of me so near to her like many women she was very much afraid of mice and she had more real cause for fear than they have for i might have gnawed through the tree on which her life depended i spoke to her in a kind and friendly manner and begged her to take courage 
 
 at last she took me up in her delicate hand and then i told her 
 what had brought me out into the world and she promised me that 
 perhaps on that very evening she should be able to obtain for me one 
 of the two treasures for which i was seeking she told me that 
 phantaesus was her very dear friend that he was as beautiful as the 
 god of love that he remained often for many hours with her under 
 the leafy boughs of the tree which then rustled and waved more than 
 ever over them both he called her his dryad she said and the tree 
 his tree for the grand old oak with its gnarled trunk was just to 
 his taste the root spreading deep into the earth the top rising 
 high in the fresh air knew the value of the drifted snow the keen 
 wind and the warm sunshine as it ought to be known yes continued the dryad the birds sing up above in the branches and talk to each other about the beautiful fields they have visited in foreign 
 lands and on one of the withered boughs a stork has built his 
 nest it is beautifully arranged and besides it is pleasant to 
 hear a little about the land of the pyramids all this pleases 
 phantaesus but it is not enough for him i am obliged to relate to 
 him of my life in the woods and to go back to my childhood when i 
 was little and the tree so small and delicate that a could overshadow it and i have to tell everything that has happened since then till now that the tree is so large and strong sit you down now under the green bindwood and pay attention when phantaesus comes i will find an opportunity to lay hold of his wing and to pull out one of the little feathers that feather you shall have a better was never given to any poet it will be quite enough for you 
 
 and when phantaesus came the feather was plucked and said 
 the little mouse i seized and put it in water and kept it there 
 till it was quite soft it was very heavy and indigestible but i 
 managed to nibble it up at last it is not so easy to nibble 
 self into a poet there are so many things to get through now 
 however i had two of them understanding and imagination and through these i knew that the third was to be found in the library a great man has said and written that there are novels whose sole and only use appeared to be that they might relieve mankind of overflowing tears a kind of sponge in fact for sucking up feelings and emotions i remembered a few of these books they had always appeared tempting to the appetite they had been much read and were so greasy that they must have absorbed no end of emotions in themselves i retraced my steps to the library and literally devoured a whole novel that is properly speaking the interior or soft part of it the crust or binding i left when i had digested not only this but a second i felt a stirring within me then i ate a small piece of a third 
 romance and felt myself a poet i said it to myself and told others the same i had and and i cannot tell what 
 aches besides i thought over all the stories that may be said to be 
 connected with sausage pegs and all that has ever been written 
 about skewers and sticks and staves and splinters came to my 
 thoughts the must have had a wonderfully clear 
 understanding i remembered the man who placed a white stick in his 
 mouth by which he could make himself and the stick invisible i 
 thought of sticks as staves of music or rhyme of 
 breaking a stick over a back and heaven knows how many more phrases of the same sort relating to sticks staves and skewers 
 
 all my thoughts rein on skewers sticks of wood and staves and as 
 i am at last a poet and i have worked terribly hard to make 
 myself one i can of course make poetry on anything i shall therefore 
 be able to wait upon you every day in the week with a poetical history 
 of a skewer and that is my soup 
 
 in that case said the we will hear what the 
 third mouse has to say 
 
 squeak squeak cried a little mouse at the kitchen door it was 
 the fourth and not the third of the four who were contending for the 
 prize one whom the rest supposed to be dead she shot in like an 
 arrow and overturned the sausage peg that had been covered with 
 crape she had been running day and night she had watched an 
 opportunity to get into a goods train and had travelled by the 
 railway and yet she had arrived almost too late she pressed forward 
 looking very much ruffled she had lost her sausage skewer but not 
 her voice for she began to speak at once as if they only waited for 
 her and would hear her only and as if nothing else in the world 
 was of the least consequence she spoke out so clearly and plainly 
 and she had come in so suddenly that no one had time to stop her or 
 to say a word while she was speaking and now let us hear what she 
 said 
 
 what the fourth mouse who spoke 
 before the third had to tell 
 i started off at once to the largest town said she but the 
 name of it has escaped me i have a very bad memory for names i was carried from the railway with some forfeited goods to the jail 
 and on arriving i made my escape and ran into the house of the 
 turnkey the turnkey was speaking of his prisoners especially of 
 one who had uttered thoughtless words these words had given rise to other words and at length they were written down and registered 
 the whole affair is like making soup of sausage skewers said he but the soup may cost him his neck 
 
 now this raised in me an interest for the prisoner continued 
 the little mouse and i watched my opportunity and slipped into 
 his apartment for there is a to be found behind every 
 closed door the prisoner looked pale he had a great beard and large sparkling eyes there was a lamp burning but the walls were so 
 black that they only looked the blacker for it the prisoner scratched 
 pictures and verses with white chalk on the black walls but i did not 
 read the verses i think he found his confinement wearisome so that i 
 was a welcome guest he enticed me with with 
 whistling and with gentle words and seemed so friendly towards me 
 that by degrees i gained confidence in him and we became friends 
 he divided his bread and water with me gave me cheese and sausage 
 and i really began to love him altogether i must own that it was a 
 very pleasant intimacy he let me run about on his hand and on his 
 arm and into his sleeve and i even crept into his beard and he 
 called me his little friend i forgot what i had come out into the 
 world for forgot my sausage skewer which i had laid in a crack in the 
 floor it is lying there still i wished to stay with him always where 
 i was for i knew that if i went away the poor prisoner would have 
 no one to be his friend which is a sad thing i stayed but he did 
 not he spoke to me so mournfully for the last time gave me double as much bread and cheese as usual and kissed his hand to me then he went away and never came back i know nothing more of his history 
 
 the jailer took possession of me now he said something about 
 soup from a sausage skewer but i could not trust him he took me in 
 his hand certainly but it was to place me in a cage like a oh how dreadful it was i had to run round and round without getting any farther in advance and only to make everybody laugh the was a charming little thing she had curly hair like the brightest gold merry eyes and such a smiling mouth 
 
 you poor little mouse said she one day as she peeped into 
 my cage i will set you free she then drew forth the iron 
 fastening and i sprang out on the and from thence to the 
 roof free free that was all i could think of not of the object 
 of my journey it grew dark and as night was coming on i found a 
 lodging in an old tower where dwelt a watchman and an owl i had no confidence in either of them least of all in the owl which is like a 
 cat and has a great failing for she eats mice one may however be 
 mistaken sometimes and so was i for this was a respectable and 
 old owl who knew more than the watchman and even as much as i did myself the young owls made a great fuss about 
 everything but the only rough words she would say to them were 
 you had better go and make some soup from sausage skewers she was very indulgent and loving to her children her conduct gave me such confidence in her that from the crack where i sat i called out 
 squeak this confidence of mine pleased her so much that she assured me she would take me under her own protection and that not a creature should do me harm the fact was she wickedly meant to keep me in reserve for her own eating in winter when food would be scarce yet she was a very clever she explained to me that the watchman could only hoot with the horn that hung loose at his side and then she said he is so terribly proud of it that he imagines 
 himself an owl in the tower wants to do great things but only 
 succeeds in small all soup on a sausage skewer then i begged the owl to give me the recipe for this soup soup from a sausage skewer said she is only a proverb amongst mankind and may be understood in many ways each believes his own way the best and after all the proverb signifies nothing nothing i exclaimed i was quite struck truth is not always agreeable but truth is above everything else as the old owl said i thought over all this and saw quite plainly that if truth was really so far above everything else it must be much more valuable than soup from a sausage skewer so i hastened to get away that i might be home in time and bring what was highest and best and above everything namely the truth the mice are an enlightened people and the is above them all he is therefore capable of making me queen for the sake of truth 
 
 your truth is a falsehood said the mouse who had not yet 
 spoken i can prepare the soup and i mean to do so 
 
 how it was prepared 
 i did not travel said the third mouse i stayed in this 
 country that was the right way one gains nothing by travelling 
 everything can be acquired here quite as easily so i stayed at 
 home i have not obtained what i know from supernatural beings i have neither swallowed it nor learnt it from conversing with owls i 
 have got it all from my reflections and thoughts will you now set the 
 kettle on the fire so now pour the water in quite full up to the 
 brim place it on the fire make up a good blaze keep it burning 
 that the water may boil it must boil over and over there now i 
 throw in the skewer will the be pleased now to dip his 
 tail into the boiling water and stir it round with the tail the 
 longer the king stirs it the stronger the soup will become nothing 
 more is necessary only to stir it 
 
 can no one else do this asked the king 
 
 no said the mouse only in the tail of the is 
 this power contained 
 
 and the water boiled and bubbled as the stood close 
 beside the kettle it seemed rather a dangerous performance but he 
 turned round and put out his tail as mice do in a dairy when they 
 wish to skim the cream from a pan of milk with their tails and 
 afterwards lick it off but the mous

 what are you doing here 
 hullo said the child what are you doing here yourself 
 and he stared at marius intently with his epic effrontery his eyes grew larger with the proud light within them 
 it was with an accent of severity that marius continued 
 who told you to come back 
 did you deliver my letter at the address 
 gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter 
 in his haste to return to the barricade he had got rid of it rather than delivered it 
 he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to make out 
 it is true that the man was bareheaded but that was not sufficient 
 in short he had been administering to himself little inward remonstrances and he feared marius reproaches 
 in order to extricate himself from the predicament he took the simplest course he lied abominably 
 citizen i delivered the letter to the porter 
 the lady was asleep she will have the letter when she wakes up 
 marius had had two objects in sending that letter 
 to bid farewell to cosette and to save gavroche 
 he was obliged to content himself with the half of his desire 
 the despatch of his letter and the presence of m fauchelevent in the barricade was a coincidence which occurred to him he pointed out m fauchelevent to gavroche 
 do you know that man 
 no said gavroche 
 gavroche had in fact as we have just mentioned seen jean valjean only at night 
 the troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in marius mind were dissipated 
 did he know m opinions perhaps m fauchelevent was a republican 
 hence his very natural presence in this combat 
 in the meanwhile gavroche was shouting at the other end of the barricade

 gavroche warned his comrades as he called them that the barricade was blocked 
 he had had great difficulty in reaching it a battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the rue de la petite truanderie was on the watch on the side of the rue du cygne on the opposite side the municipal guard occupied the rue des precheurs the bulk of the army was facing them in front 
 this information given gavroche added

 the assailants dissatisfied no doubt with their shot had not repeated it 
 a company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of the street behind the piece of ordnance 
 the soldiers were tearing up the pavement and constructing with the stones a small low wall a sort of not more than eighteen inches high and facing the barricade 
 in the angle at the left of this epaulement there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in the rue 
 enjolras on the watch thought he distinguished the peculiar sound which is produced when the shells of are drawn from the caissons and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left then the cannoneers began to load the piece 
 the chief seized the himself and lowered it to the vent 
 down with your heads hug the wall shouted enjolras and all on your knees along the barricade 
 the insurgents who were straggling in front of the and who had quitted their posts of combat on arrival rushed towards the barricade but before enjolras order could be executed the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round of this is what it was in fact 
 the charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt and had there rebounded from the wall and this terrible rebound had produced two dead and three wounded 
 if this were continued the barricade was no longer tenable the made its way in 
 a murmur of consternation arose 
 let us prevent the second discharge said enjolras 
 and lowering his rifle he took aim at the captain of the gun who at that moment was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying and definitely fixing its pointing 
 the captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery very young blond with a very gentle face and the intelligent air peculiar to that predestined and redoubtable weapon which by dint of perfecting itself in horror must end in killing war 
 combeferre who was standing beside enjolras scrutinized this young man 
 what a pity said combeferre 
 what hideous things these butcheries are 
 come when there are no more kings there will be no more war 
 enjolras you are taking aim at that sergeant you are not looking at him 
 fancy he is a charming young man he is intrepid it is evident that he is thoughtful those young are very well educated he has a father a mother a family he is probably in love he is not more than five and twenty at the most he might be your brother 
 he is said enjolras 
 yes replied combeferre he is mine too 
 well let us not kill him 
 let me alone 
 it must be done 
 and a tear trickled slowly down enjolras marble cheek

 during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre on the of october that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had gone on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by marshal enormous baggage train convoyed by westphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train 
 from vyazma onwards the french army which had till then moved in three columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit 
 the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about now joining the moving column now again lagging behind it 
 several times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and run headlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic 
 these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores the convoy of prisoners and baggage train still constituted a separate and united whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting away 
 of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had been captured or left behind some of wagons also had been captured or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had been shot by the own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession 
 the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or baggage they understood that the saddles and spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was to shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the escort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were in of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse treated them with particular moroseness and severity 
 at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking the prisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but were recaptured by the french and shot 
 the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned all who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karataev and the dog that had chosen karataev for its master 
 on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why but since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which karataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierre moved farther away and did not think about him 
 while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being by life itself that man is created for happiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simple human needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity and now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new consolatory truth that nothing in this world is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores his footgear having long since fallen to pieces he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own free will as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcely felt the worst was the state of his bare raw and feet the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no great cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at night there were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his body the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet 
 after the second march pierre having examined his feet by the campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but when everybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed up walked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were more terrible to look at than before however he did not look at them now but thought of other things 
 only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit 
 he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind though more than a hundred perished in that way he did not think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself the harder his position became and the more terrible the future the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to him

 dawn 
 at that moment cosette awoke 
 her chamber was narrow neat unobtrusive with a long facing the east on the back of the house 
 cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris 
 she had not been there on the preceding evening and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said 
 it appears that there is a row 
 cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly 
 she had had sweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white 
 some one who was marius had appeared to her in the light 
 she awoke with the sun in her eyes which at first produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured 
 like jean valjean she had a few hours previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness she began to cherish hope with all her might without knowing why then she felt a pang at her heart 
 it was three days since she had seen marius 
 but she said to herself that he must have received her letter that he knew where she was and that he was so clever that he would find means of reaching that certainly and perhaps that very was broad daylight but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very early but that she must rise nevertheless in order to receive marius 
 she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently that was sufficient and that marius would come no objection was valid 
 all this was certain 
 it was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days 
 marius absent three days this was horrible on the part of the good god 
 now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with 
 marius was about to arrive and he would bring good news 
 youth is made thus it quickly dries its eyes it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it 
 youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown quantity which is itself 
 it is natural to it to be happy it seems as though its respiration were made of hope 
 moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what explanation of it he had given her 
 every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and hides and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable there are thoughts which play us the same trick they nestle away in a corner of our brain that is the end of them they are lost it is impossible to lay the memory on them 
 cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory 
 she told herself that it was very naughty and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius 
 she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body her prayers and her toilet 
 one may in a case of exigency introduce the reader into a nuptial chamber not into a virginal chamber 
 verse would hardly venture it prose must not 
 it is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded it is whiteness in the dark it is the private cell of a closed lily which must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it 
 woman in the bud is sacred

 dawn 
 at that moment cosette awoke 
 her chamber was narrow neat unobtrusive with a long facing the east on the back of the house 
 cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris 
 she had not been there on the preceding evening and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said 
 it appears that there is a row 
 cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly 
 she had had sweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white 
 some one who was marius had appeared to her in the light 
 she awoke with the sun in her eyes which at first produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured 
 like jean valjean she had a few hours previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness she began to cherish hope with all her might without knowing why then she felt a pang at her heart 
 it was three days since she had seen marius 
 but she said to herself that he must have received her letter that he knew where she was and that he was so clever that he would find means of reaching that certainly and perhaps that very was broad daylight but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very early but that she must rise nevertheless in order to receive marius 
 she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently that was sufficient and that marius would come no objection was valid 
 all this was certain 
 it was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days 
 marius absent three days this was horrible on the part of the good god 
 now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with 
 marius was about to arrive and he would bring good news 
 youth is made thus it quickly dries its eyes it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it 
 youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown quantity which is itself 
 it is natural to it to be happy it seems as though its respiration were made of hope 
 moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what explanation of it he had given her 
 every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and hides and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable there are thoughts which play us the same trick they nestle away in a corner of our brain that is the end of them they are lost it is impossible to lay the memory on them 
 cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory 
 she told herself that it was very naughty and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius 
 she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body her prayers and her toilet 
 one may in a case of exigency introduce the reader into a nuptial chamber not into a virginal chamber 
 verse would hardly venture it prose must not 
 it is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded it is whiteness in the dark it is the private cell of a closed lily which must not be gazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it 
 woman in the bud is sacred 
 that innocent bud which opens that adorable which is afraid of itself that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle those cords tied those clasps fastened those laces drawn those tremors those shivers of cold and modesty that exquisite affright in every movement that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm the successive phases of dressing as charming as the clouds of dawn it is not fitting that all this should be narrated and it is too much to have even called attention to it

 book fourteen 
 chapter xiii 
 
 at midday on the of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own the bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road sometimes in proof of its agility and lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different animals from men to horses in various stages of decomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted 
 it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began raining harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water which ran along the ruts in streams 
 pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps in threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the rain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harder 
 it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karataev the day before 
 at their halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better there platon karataev was sitting covered up head and all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and heard voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look at platon 
 well how are you he asked 
 how am i if we grumble at sickness god grant us death replied platon and at once resumed the story he had begun 
 and so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brother 
 pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it to him alone some times and always with a specially joyful emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as to something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and life with his family and who went once to the nizhni fair with a companion a rich merchant 
 having put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knife was found under the old pillow he was tried knouted and his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karataev put it he was sent to hard labor in siberia 
 and so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten years or more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among them and they began telling what each was suffering for and how they had sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another had taken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man what are you being punished for daddy i my dear brothers said he am being punished for my own and other sins but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my poorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man began to weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when and in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet you are perishing because of me daddy he says quite true lads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for sake 
 karataev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drew the logs together 
 and the old man said god will forgive you we are all sinners in his sight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well and what do you think dear friends karataev continued his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story what do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to the authorities i have taken six lives he says he was a great sinner but what i am most sorry for is this old man let him suffer because of me so he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form the place was a long way off and while they were judging what with one thing and another filling in the papers all in due form the authorities i mean time passed the affair reached the tsar after a while the decree came to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded the paper arrived and they began to look for the old man where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain a paper has come from the tsar so they began looking for him here lower jaw trembled but god had already forgiven him he was dead how it was dear fellows karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent gazing before him with a smile 
 and soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit up face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joy

 chapter xiii 
 
 at midday on the of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own the bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road sometimes in proof of its agility and lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different animals from men to horses in various stages of decomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted 
 it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began raining harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water which ran along the ruts in streams 
 pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps in threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the rain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harder 
 it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karataev the day before 
 at their halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better there platon karataev was sitting covered up head and all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and heard voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look at platon 
 well how are you he asked 
 how am i if we grumble at sickness god grant us death replied platon and at once resumed the story he had begun 
 and so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brother 
 pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it to him alone some times and always with a specially joyful emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as to something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and life with his family and who went once to the nizhni fair with a companion a rich merchant 
 having put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knife was found under the old pillow he was tried knouted and his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karataev put it he was sent to hard labor in siberia 
 and so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten years or more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among them and they began telling what each was suffering for and how they had sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another had taken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man what are you being punished for daddy i my dear brothers said he am being punished for my own and other sins but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my poorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man began to weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when and in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet you are perishing because of me daddy he says quite true lads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for sake

 a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners from all sides came shouts of command and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the prisoners at a trot the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority the prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road the convoy formed up 
 the emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a hat with a tranquil look on his handsome plump white face it was one of the marshals his eye fell on large and striking figure and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy 
 the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face whipping up his skinny horse several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their faces all looked excited and worried 
 what did he say what did he say pierre heard them ask 
 while the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on his face besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was now an expression of quiet solemnity 
 karataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away 
 when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill 
 from behind where karataev had been sitting came the sound of a shot pierre heard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to smolensk a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and he again started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun they both looked pale and in the expression on their faces one of them glanced timidly at pierre there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that two days before that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him 
 behind him where karataev had been sitting the dog began to howl what a stupid beast why is it howling thought pierre 
 his comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling just as pierre did but there was a set look on all their faces

 the stores the prisoners and the baggage train stopped at the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfires pierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with his back to the fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino 
 again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or another gave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk 
 life is everything life is god everything changes and moves and that movement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in sufferings in innocent sufferings 
 karataev came to mind 
 and suddenly he saw vividly before him a kindly old man who had given him geography lessons in switzerland wait a bit said the old man and showed pierre a globe this globe was alive a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed places sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes one dividing into many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible but others striving to do the same compressed it sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it 
 that is life said the old teacher 
 how simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not know it before 
 god is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the surface sinks to the depths and again emerges there now karataev has spread out and disappeared do you understand my child said the teacher 
 do you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke up 
 he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian soldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy hairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal 
 all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him brigand get away 
 and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned away and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the dog sitting beside the soldier wagging its tail

 the stores the prisoners and the baggage train stopped at the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfires pierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with his back to the fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino 
 again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or another gave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk 
 life is everything life is god everything changes and moves and that movement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in sufferings in innocent sufferings 
 karataev came to mind 
 and suddenly he saw vividly before him a kindly old man who had given him geography lessons in switzerland wait a bit said the old man and showed pierre a globe this globe was alive a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed places sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes one dividing into many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible but others striving to do the same compressed it sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it 
 that is life said the old teacher 
 how simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not know it before 
 god is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the surface sinks to the depths and again emerges there now karataev has spread out and disappeared do you understand my child said the teacher 
 do you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke up 
 he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian soldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy hairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal 
 all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him brigand get away 
 and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned away and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the dog sitting beside the soldier wagging its tail 
 ah come said pierre and plat he began but did not finish 
 suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy of the look platon had given him as he sat under the tree of the shot heard from that spot of the howl of the guilty faces of the two frenchmen as they ran past him of the lowered and smoking gun and of absence at this halt and he was on the point of realizing that karataev had been killed but just at that instant he knew not why the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev and without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them pierre closed his eyes seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid vibrating globe and he sank into water so that it closed over his head

 at first while they were still moving along the kaluga road armies made their presence known but later when they reached the smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians 
 owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means of approximately ascertaining the position by cavalry scouting was not available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time if news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before by the third day when something could have been done that army was already two days march farther on and in quite another position 
 one army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were several different roads available for the french and one would have thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken something new but after a four days halt the mob with no maneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten track neither to the right nor to the left but along the old the worst road through krasnoe and orsha

 from orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna still playing at buff with the pursuing army at the berezina they again became disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but those who got across the river fled farther their supreme chief donned a fur coat and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on alone abandoning his companions the others who could do so drove away too leaving those who could not to surrender or die

 gavroche outside 
 courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets 
 gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying the full of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the slope of the redoubt into his basket 
 what are you doing there asked courfeyrac 
 gavroche raised his face

 gavroche replied 
 well it is raining 
 what then 
 courfeyrac in 
 instanter said gavroche 
 and with a single bound he plunged into the street 
 it will be remembered that company had left behind it a trail of bodies 
 twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street twenty cartouches for gavroche meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade 
 the smoke in the street was like a fog 
 whoever has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses 
 it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was 
 this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful to gavroche 
 beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen he rifled the first seven or eight without much danger 
 he crawled flat on his belly galloped on all fours took his basket in his teeth twisted glided undulated wound from one dead body to another and emptied the or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut 
 they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him

 for thirst said he putting it in his pocket 
 by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade became transparent 
 so that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the outlook behind their dike and the sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke 
 at the moment when gavroche was relieving a sergeant who was lying near a stone of his cartridges a bullet struck the body 
 fichtre ejaculated gavroche 
 they are killing my dead men for me 
 a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him a third overturned his basket 
 gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue 
 he sprang to his feet stood erect with his hair flying in the wind his hands on his hips his eyes fixed on the national guardsmen who were firing and est laid a nanterre 
 men are ugly at nanterre

 fault of voltaire

 gavroche sang je ne suis pas notaire 
 i am not a notary la faute a the fault of voltaire je suis un petit oiseau 
 a little bird la faute a rousseau

 joy is my character la faute a the fault of voltaire misere est mon trousseau misery is my trousseau la faute a rousseau

 thus it went on for some time 
 it was a charming and terrible sight 
 gavroche though shot at was teasing the fusillade

 the retreat from when he had a free road into a district and the parallel road was open to him along which kutuzov afterwards pursued him this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road is explained to us as being due to profound considerations similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat from smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe is described where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stick and said

 chapter xvi 
 
 how from a brother one becomes a father 
 at that same moment in the garden of the the gaze of the drama must be everywhere children were holding each other by the hand 
 one might have been seven years old the other five 
 the rain having soaked them they were walking along the paths on the sunny side the elder was leading the younger they were pale and ragged they had the air of wild birds the smaller of them said 
 i am very hungry 
 the elder who was already somewhat of a protector was leading his brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick 
 they were alone in the garden 
 the garden was deserted the gates had been closed by order of the police on account of the insurrection the troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of combat 
 how did those children come there 
 perhaps they had escaped from some which stood ajar perhaps there was in the vicinity at the barriere or on the esplanade de or in the neighboring carrefour dominated by the pediment on which could be read 
 invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum some booth from which they had fled perhaps they had on the preceding evening escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing and had passed the night in some one of those where people read the papers the fact is they were stray lambs and they seemed free 
 to be astray and to seem free is to be lost 
 these poor little creatures were in fact lost 
 these two children were the same over whom gavroche had been put to some trouble as the reader will recollect 
 children of the thenardiers leased out to magnon attributed to m gillenormand and now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches and swept over the ground by the wind 
 their clothing which had been clean in day and which had served her as a prospectus with m gillenormand had been converted into rags 
 henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as abandoned children whom the police take note of collect mislay and find again on the pavements of paris 
 it required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these miserable little creatures being in that garden 
 if the superintendents had caught sight of them they would have driven such rags forth poor little things do not enter public gardens still people should reflect that as children they have a right to flowers 
 these children were there thanks to the locked gates 
 they were there contrary to the regulations 
 they had slipped into the garden and there they remained 
 closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors oversight is supposed to continue but it grows slack and reposes and the inspectors moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside no longer glanced into the garden and had not seen the two delinquents 
 it had rained the night before and even a little in the morning but in june showers do not count for much 
 an hour after a storm it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept the earth in summer is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child at that period of the solstice the light of full noonday is so to speak poignant 
 it takes everything 
 it applies itself to the earth and superposes itself with a sort of suction 
 one would say that the sun was thirsty 
 a shower is but a glass of water a rainstorm is instantly drunk up 
 in the morning everything was dripping in the afternoon everything is powdered over 
 nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight it is warm freshness 
 the gardens and meadows having water at their roots and sun in their flowers become of incense and smoke with all their odors at once 
 everything smiles sings and offers itself 
 one feels gently intoxicated 
 the springtime is a provisional paradise the sun helps man to have patience 
 there are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having the azure of heaven say 
 it is enough dreamers absorbed in the wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and evil contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the attic the dungeon and the rags of shivering young girls when they can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and pitilessly satisfied strange to say the infinite suffices them 
 that great need of man the finite which admits of embrace they ignore 
 the finite which admits of progress and sublime toil they do not think about the indefinite which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite escapes them 
 provided that they are face to face with immensity they smile 
 joy never ecstasy forever their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation the history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan 
 all is not there the true all remains without what is the use of busying oneself over that detail man 
 man suffers that is quite possible but look at aldebaran rising 
 the mother has no more milk the babe is dying 
 i know nothing about that but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of of the pine presents under the microscope 
 compare the most beautiful mechlin lace to that if you can 
 these thinkers forget to love the zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child 
 god eclipses their souls this is a family of minds which are at once great and petty horace was one of them so was goethe 
 la fontaine perhaps magnificent egoists of the infinite tranquil spectators of sorrow who do not behold nero if the weather be fair for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light who hear neither the cry nor the sob nor the death rattle nor the alarm peal for whom everything is well since there is a month of may who so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads declare themselves content and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted 
 these are dark radiances 
 they have no suspicion that they are to be pitied 
 certainly they are so 
 he who does not weep does not see 
 they are to be admired and pitied as one would both pity and admire a being at once night and day without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star on his brow 
 the indifference of these thinkers is according to some a superior philosophy 
 that may be but in this superiority there is some infirmity 
 one may be immortal and yet limp witness vulcan 
 one may be more than man and less than man there is incomplete immensity in nature 
 who knows whether the sun is not a blind man 
 but then what 
 in whom can we trust 
 solem quis dicere falsum audeat who shall dare to say that the sun is false 
 thus certain geniuses themselves certain mortals may be mistaken that which is on high at the summit at the crest at the zenith that which sends down so much light on the earth sees but little sees badly sees not at all 
 is not this a desperate state of things no but what is there then above the sun 
 the god 
 on the th of june about eleven in the morning the luxembourg solitary and depopulated was charming the quincunxes and shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight 
 the branches wild with the brilliant glow of midday seemed endeavoring to embrace 
 in the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets sparrows triumphed woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees administering little pecks on the bark the accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness the peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible 
 the old crows of marie de medici were amorous in the tall trees 
 the sun gilded empurpled set fire to and lighted up the tulips which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers 
 all around the banks of tulips the bees the sparks of these hummed all was grace and gayety even the impending rain this relapse by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit had nothing disturbing about it the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low 
 he who was there aspired to happiness life smelled good all nature exhaled candor help assistance paternity caress dawn 
 the thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it 
 the statues under the trees white and nude had robes of shadow pierced with light these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight rays hung from them on all sides 
 around the great fountain the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt there was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there 
 a few yellow leaves left over from the autumn chased each other merrily and seemed to be playing tricks on each other 
 this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it 
 life sap heat odors overflowed one was conscious beneath creation of the enormous size of the source in all these breaths permeated with love in this interchange of reverberations and reflections in this marvellous expenditure of rays in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible and behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame one caught a glimpse of god that millionaire of stars 
 thanks to the sand there was not a speck of mud thanks to the rain there was not a grain of ashes 
 the clumps of blossoms had just been bathed every sort of velvet satin gold and varnish which springs from the earth in the form of flowers was irreproachable this magnificence was cleanly 
 the grand silence of happy nature filled the garden 
 a celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music the cooing of nests the buzzing of swarms the flutterings of the breeze 
 all the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious whole the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order the lilacs ended the jasmines began some flowers were tardy some insects in advance of their time the of the red june butterflies fraternized with the of the white butterflies of may 
 the plantain trees were getting their new skins 
 the breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the it was splendid a veteran from the neighboring barracks who was gazing through the fence said 
 here is the spring presenting arms and in full uniform 
 all nature was breakfasting creation was at table this was its hour the great blue cloth was spread in the sky and the great green cloth on earth the sun lighted it all up brilliantly 
 god was serving the universal repast 
 each creature had his pasture or his mess the found his the chaffinch found his millet the goldfinch found chickweed the found worms the green finch found flies the fly found infusoriae the bee found flowers they ate each other somewhat it is true which is the misery of evil mixed with good but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach 
 the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain and rather bewildered by all this light they tried to hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence and they kept behind the swans hutch 
 here and there at intervals when the wind blew shouts clamor a sort of tumultuous death rattle which was the firing and dull blows which were discharges of cannon struck the ear confusedly smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the halles 
 a bell which had the air of an appeal was ringing in the distance 
 these children did not appear to notice these noises 
 the little one repeated from time to time 
 i am hungry 
 almost at the same instant with the children another couple approached the great basin 
 they consisted of a goodman about fifty years of age who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six 
 no doubt a father and his son 
 the little man of six had a big brioche 
 at that epoch certain houses abutting on the river in the rues madame and had keys to the luxembourg garden of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut a privilege which was suppressed later on 
 this father and son came from one of these houses no doubt 
 the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and hid themselves a little more thoroughly 
 he was a bourgeois 
 the same person perhaps whom marius had one day heard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling his son to avoid excesses 
 he had an affable and haughty air and a mouth which was always smiling since it did not shut this mechanical smile produced by too much jaw and too little skin shows the teeth rather than the soul 
 the child with his brioche which he had bitten into but had not finished eating seemed satiated the child was dressed as a national guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence 
 father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans he resembled them in this sense that he walked like them 
 for the moment the swans were swimming which is their principal talent and they were superb 
 if the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an age to understand they might have gathered the words of this grave man 
 the father was saying to his son 
 the sage lives content with little 
 look at me my son 
 i do not love pomp 
 i am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones i leave that false splendor to badly organized souls 
 here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar 
 what is that inquired the child 
 the father replied 
 it is the saturnalia 
 all at once he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green 
 there is the beginning said he 
 and after a pause he added 
 anarchy is entering this garden 
 in the meanwhile his son took a bite of his brioche spit it out and suddenly burst out crying 
 what are you crying about demanded his father 
 i am not hungry any more said the child 
 the smile became more accentuated 
 one does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake 
 my cake tires me 
 it is stale 
 you want any more of it 
 no 
 the father pointed to the swans 
 throw it to those palmipeds 
 the child hesitated 
 a person may not want any more of his cake but that is no reason for giving it away 
 the father went on 
 be humane 
 you must have compassion on animals 
 and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin 
 the cake fell very near the edge 
 the swans were far away in the centre of the basin and busy with some prey 
 they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche 
 the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraphic agitation which finally attracted the attention of the swans 
 they perceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as they are and slowly directed their course toward the brioche with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures 
 the swans cygnes understand signs signes said the bourgeois delighted to make a jest 
 at that moment the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden increase 
 this time it was sinister 
 there are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than others 
 the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined clamors platoon firing and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon this coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun 
 the swans had not yet reached the brioche 
 let us return home said the father they are attacking the tuileries 
 he grasped his hand again 
 then he continued

 how from a brother one becomes a father 
 at that same moment in the garden of the the gaze of the drama must be everywhere children were holding each other by the hand 
 one might have been seven years old the other five 
 the rain having soaked them they were walking along the paths on the sunny side the elder was leading the younger they were pale and ragged they had the air of wild birds the smaller of them said 
 i am very hungry 
 the elder who was already somewhat of a protector was leading his brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick 
 they were alone in the garden 
 the garden was deserted the gates had been closed by order of the police on account of the insurrection the troops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of combat 
 how did those children come there 
 perhaps they had escaped from some which stood ajar perhaps there was in the vicinity at the barriere or on the esplanade de or in the neighboring carrefour dominated by the pediment on which could be read 
 invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum some booth from which they had fled perhaps they had on the preceding evening escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing and had passed the night in some one of those where people read the papers the fact is they were stray lambs and they seemed free 
 to be astray and to seem free is to be lost 
 these poor little creatures were in fact lost 
 these two children were the same over whom gavroche had been put to some trouble as the reader will recollect 
 children of the thenardiers leased out to magnon attributed to m gillenormand and now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches and swept over the ground by the wind 
 their clothing which had been clean in day and which had served her as a prospectus with m gillenormand had been converted into rags 
 henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as abandoned children whom the police take note of collect mislay and find again on the pavements of paris 
 it required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these miserable little creatures being in that garden 
 if the superintendents had caught sight of them they would have driven such rags forth poor little things do not enter public gardens still people should reflect that as children they have a right to flowers 
 these children were there thanks to the locked gates 
 they were there contrary to the regulations 
 they had slipped into the garden and there they remained 
 closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors oversight is supposed to continue but it grows slack and reposes and the inspectors moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside no longer glanced into the garden and had not seen the two delinquents 
 it had rained the night before and even a little in the morning but in june showers do not count for much 
 an hour after a storm it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept the earth in summer is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child at that period of the solstice the light of full noonday is so to speak poignant 
 it takes everything 
 it applies itself to the earth and superposes itself with a sort of suction 
 one would say that the sun was thirsty 
 a shower is but a glass of water a rainstorm is instantly drunk up 
 in the morning everything was dripping in the afternoon everything is powdered over 
 nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight it is warm freshness 
 the gardens and meadows having water at their roots and sun in their flowers become of incense and smoke with all their odors at once 
 everything smiles sings and offers itself 
 one feels gently intoxicated 
 the springtime is a provisional paradise the sun helps man to have patience 
 there are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having the azure of heaven say 
 it is enough dreamers absorbed in the wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and evil contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the attic the dungeon and the rags of shivering young girls when they can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and pitilessly satisfied strange to say the infinite suffices them 
 that great need of man the finite which admits of embrace they ignore 
 the finite which admits of progress and sublime toil they do not think about the indefinite which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite escapes them 
 provided that they are face to face with immensity they smile 
 joy never ecstasy forever their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation the history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan 
 all is not there the true all remains without what is the use of busying oneself over that detail man 
 man suffers that is quite possible but look at aldebaran rising 
 the mother has no more milk the babe is dying 
 i know nothing about that but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of of the pine presents under the microscope 
 compare the most beautiful mechlin lace to that if you can 
 these thinkers forget to love the zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child 
 god eclipses their souls this is a family of minds which are at once great and petty horace was one of them so was goethe 
 la fontaine perhaps magnificent egoists of the infinite tranquil spectators of sorrow who do not behold nero if the weather be fair for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light who hear neither the cry nor the sob nor the death rattle nor the alarm peal for whom everything is well since there is a month of may who so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads declare themselves content and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted 
 these are dark radiances 
 they have no suspicion that they are to be pitied 
 certainly they are so 
 he who does not weep does not see 
 they are to be admired and pitied as one would both pity and admire a being at once night and day without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star on his brow 
 the indifference of these thinkers is according to some a superior philosophy 
 that may be but in this superiority there is some infirmity 
 one may be immortal and yet limp witness vulcan 
 one may be more than man and less than man there is incomplete immensity in nature 
 who knows whether the sun is not a blind man 
 but then what 
 in whom can we trust 
 solem quis dicere falsum audeat who shall dare to say that the sun is false 
 thus certain geniuses themselves certain mortals may be mistaken that which is on high at the summit at the crest at the zenith that which sends down so much light on the earth sees but little sees badly sees not at all 
 is not this a desperate state of things no but what is there then above the sun 
 the god 
 on the th of june about eleven in the morning the luxembourg solitary and depopulated was charming the quincunxes and shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight 
 the branches wild with the brilliant glow of midday seemed endeavoring to embrace 
 in the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets sparrows triumphed woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees administering little pecks on the bark the accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness the peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible 
 the old crows of marie de medici were amorous in the tall trees 
 the sun gilded empurpled set fire to and lighted up the tulips which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers 
 all around the banks of tulips the bees the sparks of these hummed all was grace and gayety even the impending rain this relapse by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit had nothing disturbing about it the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low 
 he who was there aspired to happiness life smelled good all nature exhaled candor help assistance paternity caress dawn 
 the thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it 
 the statues under the trees white and nude had robes of shadow pierced with light these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight rays hung from them on all sides 
 around the great fountain the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt there was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there 
 a few yellow leaves left over from the autumn chased each other merrily and seemed to be playing tricks on each other 
 this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it 
 life sap heat odors overflowed one was conscious beneath creation of the enormous size of the source in all these breaths permeated with love in this interchange of reverberations and reflections in this marvellous expenditure of rays in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible and behind this splendor as behind a curtain of flame one caught a glimpse of god that millionaire of stars 
 thanks to the sand there was not a speck of mud thanks to the rain there was not a grain of ashes 
 the clumps of blossoms had just been bathed every sort of velvet satin gold and varnish which springs from the earth in the form of flowers was irreproachable this magnificence was cleanly 
 the grand silence of happy nature filled the garden 
 a celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music the cooing of nests the buzzing of swarms the flutterings of the breeze 
 all the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious whole the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order the lilacs ended the jasmines began some flowers were tardy some insects in advance of their time the of the red june butterflies fraternized with the of the white butterflies of may 
 the plantain trees were getting their new skins 
 the breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the it was splendid a veteran from the neighboring barracks who was gazing through the fence said 
 here is the spring presenting arms and in full uniform 
 all nature was breakfasting creation was at table this was its hour the great blue cloth was spread in the sky and the great green cloth on earth the sun lighted it all up brilliantly 
 god was serving the universal repast 
 each creature had his pasture or his mess the found his the chaffinch found his millet the goldfinch found chickweed the found worms the green finch found flies the fly found infusoriae the bee found flowers they ate each other somewhat it is true which is the misery of evil mixed with good but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach 
 the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain and rather bewildered by all this light they tried to hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence and they kept behind the swans hutch 
 here and there at intervals when the wind blew shouts clamor a sort of tumultuous death rattle which was the firing and dull blows which were discharges of cannon struck the ear confusedly smoke hung over the roofs in the direction of the halles 
 a bell which had the air of an appeal was ringing in the distance 
 these children did not appear to notice these noises 
 the little one repeated from time to time 
 i am hungry 
 almost at the same instant with the children another couple approached the great basin 
 they consisted of a goodman about fifty years of age who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six 
 no doubt a father and his son 
 the little man of six had a big brioche 
 at that epoch certain houses abutting on the river in the rues madame and had keys to the luxembourg garden of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut a privilege which was suppressed later on 
 this father and son came from one of these houses no doubt 
 the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and hid themselves a little more thoroughly 
 he was a bourgeois 
 the same person perhaps whom marius had one day heard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling his son to avoid excesses 
 he had an affable and haughty air and a mouth which was always smiling since it did not shut this mechanical smile produced by too much jaw and too little skin shows the teeth rather than the soul 
 the child with his brioche which he had bitten into but had not finished eating seemed satiated the child was dressed as a national guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence 
 father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans he resembled them in this sense that he walked like them 
 for the moment the swans were swimming which is their principal talent and they were superb 
 if the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an age to understand they might have gathered the words of this grave man 
 the father was saying to his son 
 the sage lives content with little 
 look at me my son 
 i do not love pomp 
 i am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones i leave that false splendor to badly organized souls 
 here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the halles burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar 
 what is that inquired the child 
 the father replied 
 it is the saturnalia 
 all at once he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green 
 there is the beginning said he 
 and after a pause he added 
 anarchy is entering this garden 
 in the meanwhile his son took a bite of his brioche spit it out and suddenly burst out crying 
 what are you crying about demanded his father 
 i am not hungry any more said the child 
 the smile became more accentuated 
 one does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake 
 my cake tires me 
 it is stale 
 you want any more of it 
 no 
 the father pointed to the swans 
 throw it to those palmipeds 
 the child hesitated 
 a person may not want any more of his cake but that is no reason for giving it away 
 the father went on 
 be humane 
 you must have compassion on animals 
 and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin 
 the cake fell very near the edge 
 the swans were far away in the centre of the basin and busy with some prey 
 they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche 
 the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraphic agitation which finally attracted the attention of the swans 
 they perceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as they are and slowly directed their course toward the brioche with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures 
 the swans cygnes understand signs signes said the bourgeois delighted to make a jest 
 at that moment the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden increase 
 this time it was sinister 
 there are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than others 
 the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined clamors platoon firing and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon this coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun 
 the swans had not yet reached the brioche 
 let us return home said the father they are attacking the tuileries 
 he grasped his hand again 
 then he continued 
 from the tuileries to the luxembourg there is but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage that is not far shots will soon rain down 
 he glanced at the cloud 
 perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down the sky is joining in the younger branch is condemned 
 let us return home quickly 
 i should like to see the swans eat the brioche said the child 
 the father replied 
 that would be imprudent 
 and he led his little bourgeois away 
 the son regretting the swans turned his head back toward the basin until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him 
 in the meanwhile the two little waifs had approached the brioche at the same time as the swans 
 it was floating on the water the smaller of them stared at the cake the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois

 what russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it is that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry and freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relate the aim of the russians was to stop the french to cut them off and capture them all 
 how was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture them can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how could that happen 
 history or what is called by that name replying to these questions says that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov and this man and that man did not execute such and such maneuvers 
 but why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished but even if we admitted that kutuzov chichagov and others were the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensible why the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe and at the berezina in both cases we had superior forces the french army with its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was what the russians aimed at 
 the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is unfounded for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino 
 why was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at borodino defeated at krasnoe and the berezina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically superior 
 if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing napoleon and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian historians 
 the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for napoleon and defeats for kutuzov 
 but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french victories brought the french complete destruction while the series of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country 
 the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this last period of the war of an aim that never existed namely that of cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army 
 there never was or could have been such an aim for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible 
 it would have been senseless first because disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say was doing just what every russian desired so what was the use of performing various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they possibly could 
 secondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight 
 thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice own troops in order to destroy the french army which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december namely a hundredth part of the original army 
 fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor kings and dukes whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the russians as the most adroit diplomatists of the time joseph de maistre and others recognized still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger 
 all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even that could be said for those who drew up this project for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds 
 but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have been senseless it was impossible 
 it was impossible first because as experience shows that a movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans the probability of chichagov kutuzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility as in fact thought kutuzov who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results 
 secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which army was retiring incomparably greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required 
 thirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has no meaning one can cut off a slice of bread but not an army to cut off an army to bar its road is quite impossible for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on hand men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike 
 fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself 
 during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the army without a battle 
 and it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but for months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold when half the army perished in a single month it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place tormasov to another place and chichagov should have crossed more than in snow to somewhere else and how routed and cut off the french and so on and so on 
 the russians half of whom died did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blame because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they should do what was impossible 
 all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals and not the history of the events 
 to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them for it does not come within the range of their investigation 
 yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution 
 the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable 
 the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped 
 the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head

 the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable 
 the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped 
 the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head

 when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wound which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch 
 after prince death natasha and princess mary alike felt this drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact everything a carriage passing rapidly in the street a summons to dinner the inquiry what dress to prepare or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully irritated the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them 
 only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they spoke little even to one another and when they did it was of very unimportant matters 
 both avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes 
 continued abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling 
 but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy princess mary in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight she received letters from her relations to which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough alpatych came to yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life did not stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natasha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts with alpatych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to moscow 
 natasha remained alone and from the time princess mary began making preparations for departure held aloof from her too 
 princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to moscow and both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her 
 i am not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed to her do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow 
 after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly changed her position and expression and picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go 
 she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which with a terrible questioning too great for her strength her spiritual gaze was fixed 
 one day toward the end of december natasha pale and thin dressed in a black woolen gown her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door 
 she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other side of life and that other side of life of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity 
 she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been at mytishchi at troitsa and at yaroslavl 
 she saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken 
 there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning his head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs twitches just perceptibly but rapidly natasha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain what is that pain like why does he have that pain what does he feel how does it hurt him thought natasha he noticed her watching him raised his eyes and began to speak seriously 
 one thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever to a suffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly at her natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say she said this go on it you will get well quite well 
 she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze 
 i agreed natasha now said to herself that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought it would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live and feared death and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant i thought quite differently had i said what i thought i should have said even if he had to go on dying to die continually before my eyes i should have been happy compared with what i am now now there is nothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will know it and now it will never never be possible to put it right and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her only in her imagination natasha this time gave him a different answer she stopped him and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for me there is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death and in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now i love thee thee i love love she said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort 
 she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this again everything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was and now now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears dunyasha her maid entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress

 chapter xviii 
 
 the vulture become prey 
 we must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should be omitted 
 whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have just mentioned the barricade for those who are inside it remains none the less a vision 
 there is something of the apocalypse in civil war all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes revolutions are sphinxes and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream 
 the feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in the case of marius and we shall see the consequences they are both more and less than life 
 on emerging from a barricade one no longer knows what one has seen there 
 one has been terrible but one knows it not 
 one has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces head has been in the light of the future there were corpses lying prone there and phantoms standing erect the hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity 
 one has lived in death 
 shadows have passed by 
 what were they 
 one has beheld hands on which there was blood there was a deafening horror there was also a frightful silence there were open mouths which shouted and other open mouths which held their peace one was in the midst of smoke of night perhaps 
 one fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths one stares at something red on finger nails 
 one no longer remembers anything 
 let us return to the rue de la chanvrerie 
 all at once between two discharges the distant sound of a clock striking the hour became audible 
 it is midday said combeferre 
 the twelve strokes had not finished striking when enjolras sprang to his feet and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout 
 carry stones up into the houses line the windowsills and the roofs with them 
 half the men to their guns the other half to the there is not a minute to be lost 
 a squad of sappers and miners axe on shoulder had just made their appearance in battle array at the end of the street 
 this could only be the head of a column and of what column the attacking column evidently the sappers charged with the demolition of the barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it 
 they were evidently on the brink of that moment which m in called the tug of war 
 enjolras order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to ships and barricades the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible 
 in less than a minute two thirds of the stones which enjolras had had piled up at the door of corinthe had been carried up to the first floor and the attic and before a second minute had elapsed these stones artistically set one upon the other walled up the on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their height 
 a few carefully planned by feuilly the principal architect allowed of the passage of the this armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of had ceased the two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there and if possible a breach for the assault 
 when the stones destined to the final defence were in place enjolras had the bottles which he had set under the table where mabeuf lay carried to the first floor 
 who is to drink that 
 bossuet asked him 
 they replied enjolras 
 then they barricaded the window below and held in readiness the iron which served to secure the door of the at night 
 the fortress was complete 
 the barricade was the rampart the was the dungeon 
 with the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet 
 as the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of their ammunition and as the assailants know this the assailants combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure expose themselves to fire prematurely though in appearance more than in reality and take their ease 
 the preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical deliberation after which the lightning strikes 
 this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything 
 he felt that since such men were to die their death ought to be a masterpiece 
 he said to marius 
 we are the two leaders 
 i will give the last orders inside 
 do you remain outside and observe 
 marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade 
 enjolras had the door of the kitchen which was the ambulance as the reader will remember nailed up 
 no splashing of the wounded he said 
 he issued his final orders in the in a curt but profoundly tranquil tone feuilly listened and replied in the name of all 
 on the first floor hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase have you them 
 yes said feuilly 
 how many 
 two axes and a 
 that is good 
 there are now combatants of us on foot how many guns are there 
 
 eight too many 
 keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand swords and pistols in your belts 
 twenty men to the barricade six ambushed in the attic windows and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants through the in the stones let not a single worker remain inactive here 
 presently when the drum beats the assault let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade the first to arrive will have the best places 
 these arrangements made he turned to javert and said 
 i am not forgetting you 
 and laying a pistol on the table he added 
 the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy 
 here inquired a voice 
 no let us not mix their corpses with our own 
 the little barricade of the mondetour lane can be scaled 
 it is only four feet high the man is well pinioned 
 he shall be taken thither and put to death 
 there was some one who was more impassive at that moment than enjolras it was javert 
 here jean valjean made his appearance 
 he had been lost among the group of insurgents 
 he stepped forth and said to enjolras 
 you are the commander 
 yes 
 you thanked me a while ago 
 in the name of the republic 
 the barricade has two saviors marius pontmercy and yourself 
 do you think that i deserve a recompense 
 certainly 
 well i request one 
 what is it 
 that i may blow that brains out 
 javert raised his head saw jean valjean made an almost imperceptible movement and said 
 that is just 
 as for enjolras he had begun to his rifle he cut his eyes about him 
 no objections 
 and he turned to jean valjean 
 take the spy 
 jean valjean did in fact take possession of javert by seating himself on the end of the table 
 he seized the pistol and a faint click announced that he had cocked it 
 almost at the same moment a blast of trumpets became audible 
 take care shouted marius from the top of the barricade 
 javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him and gazing intently at the insurgents he said to them 
 you are in no better case than i am 
 all out shouted enjolras 
 the insurgents poured out tumultuously and as they went received in the we be permitted the expression this sally of 
 we shall meet again shortly

 there are now combatants of us on foot how many guns are there 
 
 eight too many 
 keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand swords and pistols in your belts 
 twenty men to the barricade six ambushed in the attic windows and at the window on the first floor to fire on the assailants through the in the stones let not a single worker remain inactive here 
 presently when the drum beats the assault let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade the first to arrive will have the best places 
 these arrangements made he turned to javert and said 
 i am not forgetting you 
 and laying a pistol on the table he added 
 the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy 
 here inquired a voice 
 no let us not mix their corpses with our own 
 the little barricade of the mondetour lane can be scaled 
 it is only four feet high the man is well pinioned 
 he shall be taken thither and put to death 
 there was some one who was more impassive at that moment than enjolras it was javert 
 here jean valjean made his appearance 
 he had been lost among the group of insurgents 
 he stepped forth and said to enjolras 
 you are the commander 
 yes 
 you thanked me a while ago 
 in the name of the republic 
 the barricade has two saviors marius pontmercy and yourself 
 do you think that i deserve a recompense 
 certainly 
 well i request one 
 what is it 
 that i may blow that brains out 
 javert raised his head saw jean valjean made an almost imperceptible movement and said 
 that is just 
 as for enjolras he had begun to his rifle he cut his eyes about him 
 no objections 
 and he turned to jean valjean 
 take the spy 
 jean valjean did in fact take possession of javert by seating himself on the end of the table 
 he seized the pistol and a faint click announced that he had cocked it 
 almost at the same moment a blast of trumpets became audible 
 take care shouted marius from the top of the barricade 
 javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him and gazing intently at the insurgents he said to them 
 you are in no better case than i am 
 all out shouted enjolras 
 the insurgents poured out tumultuously and as they went received in the we be permitted the expression this sally of 
 we shall meet again shortly

 chapter ii 
 
 besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family all of them her father mother and sonya were so near to her so familiar so commonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she heard words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not grasp them 
 what misfortune what misfortune can happen to them they just live their own old quiet and commonplace life thought natasha 
 as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her room his face was puckered up and wet with tears he had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him when he saw natasha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face 
 pe petya go go she is calling and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair he almost fell into it covering his face with his hands 
 suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through whole being terrible anguish struck her heart she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life the sight of her father the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door made her immediately forget herself and her own grief 
 she ran to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to her door princess mary pale and with quivering chin came out from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to her natasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid steps pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself and then ran to her mother 
 the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position stretching out and beating her head against the wall sonya and the maids were holding her arms 
 natasha natasha cried the countess not true not true lying natasha she shrieked pushing those around her away go away all of you not true killed ha ha ha not true 
 natasha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her mother embraced her and with unexpected strength raised her turned her face toward herself and clung to her 
 mummy darling i am here my dearest mummy she kept on whispering not pausing an instant 
 she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her demanded a pillow and hot water and unfastened and tore open her dress 
 my dearest darling mummy my precious she whispered incessantly kissing her head her hands her face and feeling her own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks 
 the countess pressed her hand closed her eyes and became quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness glanced vacantly around her and seeing natasha began to press her head with all her strength then she turned toward her face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it 
 natasha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper natasha you would not deceive me tell me the whole truth 
 natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness 
 my darling mummy she repeated straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother 
 and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium 
 natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the next day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment not explaining or consoling but recalling her to life 
 during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes and natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly 
 how glad i am you have come you are tired you have some tea natasha went up to her you have improved in looks and grown more manly continued the countess taking her hand 
 mamma what are you saying 
 natasha he is no more no more 
 and embracing her daughter the countess began to weep for the first time

 of suspicion 
 suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds they ever fly by twilight 
 certainly they are to be repressed or at the least well guarded for they cloud 
 the mind they lose mends and they check with business whereby business cannot go on currently and constantly they dispose kings to tyranny husbands to jealousy wise men to irresolution and melancholy they are defects not in the heart but in the brain for they take place in the stoutest natures as in the example of henry the seventh of england there was not a more suspicious man nor a more stout 
 and in such a composition they do small hurt for commonly they are not admitted but with examination whether they be likely or no but in fearful natures they gain ground too fast there is nothing makes a man suspect much more than to know lime and therefore men should remedy suspicion by procuring to know more and not to keep their suspicions in smother what would men have do they think those they employ and deal with are saints do they not think they will have their own ends and be truer to themselves than to mem 
 therefore there is no better way to moderate suspicions than to account upon such suspicions as true and yet to bridle them as false for so far a man ought to make use of suspicions as to provide as if that should be true that he suspects yet it may do him no hurt suspicions that the mind of itself gamers are but buzzes but suspicions that are artificially nourished and put into heads by the tales and whisperings of others have stings 
 certainly the best mean to clear the way in this same wood of suspicions is frankly to communicate them with the party that he suspects for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the truth of them than he did before and withal shall make that party more circumspect not to give further cause of suspicion but this would not be done to men of base natures for they if they find themselves once suspected will never be true the italian says sospetto licentia fede as if suspicion did give a passport to faith but it ought rather to kindle it to discharge itself

 sooner than that as it happened a repulsive squishing sound suddenly becameall too obvious behind them han opened his eyes but could still see nothing leialooked up to the alcove beyond and her gaze turned to an expression of horror forthe curtain had been drawn away and the entire area floor to ceiling was composedof a gallery of the most disgusting miscreants of 
 hand shot up to her mouth 
 what is it han pressed her something obviously was terribly wrong hestared into his own blackness 
 an obscene cackle rose from the other side of the alcove a huttese cackle 
 han held his head closed his eyes again as if to keep away the inevitable for justone more moment i know that laugh 
 the curtain on the far side was suddenly drawn open there sat jabba ishi boba and several guards they all laughed kept laughing laughed to punish

 even blind solo could slide into smooth talk easier than a i was on my way back to pay you when i got a little now iknow had our differences but sure we can work this out 
 this time jabba genuinely chuckled too late for that solo you mayhave been the best smuggler in the business but now bantha fodder he cutshort his smile and gestured to his guards take him

 threepio been watching everything from his place behind jabba couldwatch no more he turned away in dread 
 leia on the other hand stood tall before the loathsome monarch her anger ranhigh with all the galaxy by this petty scumdealer was more outrageous than shecould tolerate still she kept her voice calm for she was in the end a have powerful friends jabba you will soon regret this 
 sure sure the old gangster rumbled with glee but in the meantime iwill thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of your company 
 he pulled her eagerly to him until their faces were mere inches apart her bellypressed to his oily snake skin she thought about killing him outright then and she held her ire in check since the rest of these vermin might have killed herbefore she could escape with han better odds were sure to come later so sheswallowed hard and for the time being put up with this slimepot as best she could 
 threepio peeked out momentarily then immediately withdrew again oh watch 
 foul beast that he was jabba poked his fat dripping tongue out to the slopped a beastly kiss squarely on her mouth 
 han was thrown roughly into the dungeon cell the door crashed shut behind fell to the floor in the darkness then picked himself up and sat against the a few moments of pounding the ground with his fist he quieted down and triedto organize his thoughts 
 darkness well blast it blind is blind no use wishing for moondew on ameteorite only it was so frustrating coming out of like that saved bythe one person who 
 leia the star stomach dropped at the thought of what must behappening to her now if only he knew where he was tentatively he knocked onthe wall behind him solid rock 
 what could he do bargain maybe but what did he have to bargain question he did i ever have to have something before i couldbargain with it 
 what though money jabba had more than he could ever count could give jabba more pleasure than to defile the princess and kill solo were fact it look like they could get much worse 
 then he heard the growl a low formidable snarl from out of the denseblackness at the far corner of the cell the growl of a large and angry beast 
 the hair on arms stood on end quickly he rose his back to the like got company he muttered 
 the wild creature bellowed out an insane groawwwwr and raced straight atsolo grabbing him ferociously around the chest lifting him several feet into the off his breathing 
 han was totally motionless for several long believe hisears chewie is that you 
 the giant wookiee barked with joy 
 for the second time in an hour solo was overcome with happiness but this wasan entirely different matter all right all right wait a second crushing me 
 chewbacca put his friend down han reached up and scratched his chewie cooed like a pup 
 okay going on around here anyway han was instantly back on was unbelievably good was someone he could make a plan not only someone but his most loyal friend in the galaxy 
 chewie filled him in at length arh arhaghh shpahrgh rahr aurowwwrahrahgrop rahp rah 
 plan what is he doing here 
 chewie barked extensively 
 han shook his head is luke crazy you listen to him that even take care of himself let alone rescue anyone 
 rowr ahragh awf ahraroww rowh rohngr grgrff rf rf 
 a jedi knight come on out of it for a little while and everybody getsdelusions 
 chewbacca growled insistently 
 han nodded dubiously in the blackness believe it when i see it hecommented walking stoutly into the wall if excuse the expression 
 the iron main gate of palace scraped open harshly oiled only with sandand time standing outside in the dusty gale staring into the black cavernousentranceway was luke skywalker 
 he was clad in the robe of the jedi cassock bore neithergun nor lightsaber he stood loosely without bravado taking a measure of the placebefore entering he was a man now wiser like a more from loss thanfrom years loss of illusions loss of dependency loss of friends to war lossof sleep to stress loss of laughter loss of his hand 
 but of all his losses the greatest was that which came from knowledge and fromthe deep recognition that he could never what he knew so many things hewished never learned he had aged with the weight of this knowledge 
 knowledge brought benefits of course he was less impulsive had given him perspective a framework in which to fit the events of is a lattice of spatial and time coordinates spanning his existence backearliest memories ahead to a hundred alternative futures a lattice of depths andconundrums and interstices through which luke could peer at any new event in hislife peer at it with perspective a lattice of shadows and corners rolling back to thevanishing point on the horizon of mind and all these shadow boxes that lentsuch perspective to thingswell this lattice gave his life a certain darkness 
 nothing of substance of in any case some would have said thisshading gave a depth to his personality where before it had been thin such a suggestion probably would have come from jaded a jaded time nonetheless there was a certain darkness now 
 there were other advantages to knowledge rationality etiquette of them all was a true sword but it did have its advantages 
 furthermore he was skilled in the craft of the jedi now where before beenmerely precocious 
 he was more aware now 
 these were all desirable attributes to be sure and luke knew as well as anyonethat all things alive must grow still it carried a certain sadness the sum of all thisknowledge a certain sense of regret but who could afford to be a boy in timessuch as these 
 resolutely luke strode into the arching hallway 
 almost immediately two gamorreans stepped up blocking his path one spokein voice that did not invite debate no chuba 
 luke raised his hand and pointed at the guards before either could draw aweapon they were both clutching their own throats choking gasping they fell totheir knees 
 luke lowered his hand and walked on the guards suddenly able to breatheagain slumped to the steps they follow 
 around the next corner luke was met by bib fortuna fortuna began speakingas he approached the young jedi but luke never broke stride so bib had to reversehis direction in and hurry along with skywalker in order to carry onconversation 
 you must be the one called skywalker his excellency will not see you 
 i will speak to jabba now luke spoke evenly never slowing they passedseveral more guards at the next crossing who fell in behind them 
 the great jabba is asleep bib explained he has instructed me to tell youthere will be no bargains 
 luke stopped suddenly and stared at bib he locked eyes with the his hand slightly took a minutely inward turn you will take me to 
 bib paused tilted his head a fraction what were his instructions oh he remembered i will take you to jabba now 
 he turned and walked down the twisting corridor that led to the throne followed him into the gloom 
 you serve your master well he whispered in ear 
 i serve my master well bib nodded with conviction 
 you are sure to be rewarded luke added 
 bib smiled smugly i am sure to be rewarded 
 as luke and bib entered court the level of tumult dropped precipitouslyas if presence had a cooling effect everyone felt a change 
 the lieutenant and the jedi knight approached the throne luke saw leiaseated there now by belly she was chained at the neck and dressed in theskimpy costume of a dancing girl he could feel her pain immediately from acrossthe he said nothing even look at her shut her anguish completelyout of his mind for he needed to focus his attention entirely on jabba 
 leia for her part sensed this at once she closed her mind to luke to keepherself from distracting him yet at the same time she kept it open ready to receiveany sliver of information she might need to act she felt charged with possibilities 
 threepio peeked out from behind the throne as bib walked up for the firsttime in many days he scanned his hope program ah at last master to take me away from all this he beamed 
 bib stood proudly before jabba master i present luke skywalker jediknight 
 i told you not to admit him the growled in huttese 
 i must be allowed to speak luke spoke quietly though his words were heardthroughout the hall 
 he must be allowed to speak bob concurred thoughtfully 
 jabba furious bashed bib across the face and sent his reeling to the fool using an old jedi mind trick 
 luke let all the rest of the motley horde that surrounded him melt into therecesses of his consciousness to let jabba fill his mind totally you will bringcaptain solo and the wookiee to me 
 jabba smiled grimly your mind powers will not work on me boy i am notaffected by your human thought pattern then as an afterthought i was killingyour kind when being a jedi meant something 
 luke altered his stance somewhat internally and externally nevertheless iam taking captain solo and his friends you can either profit from thisor bedestroyed your choice but i warn you not to underestimate my powers hespoke in his own language which jabba well understood 
 jabba laughed the laugh of a lion cautioned by a mouse 
 threepio who had been observing this interplay intently leaned forward towhisper to luke master standing a guard abruptly restrained theconcerned droid though and pulled him back to his place 
 jabba cut short his laugh with a scowl there will be no bargain young shall enjoy watching you die 
 luke raised his hand a pistol jumped out of the holster of a nearby guard andlanded snugly in the palm luke pointed the weapon at jabba 
 jabba spat boscka 
 the floor suddenly dropped away sending luke and his guard crashing into thepit below the trap door immediately closed again all the beasts of the courtrushed to the and looked down 
 luke yelled leia she felt part of her self torn away pulled down into thepit with him she started forward but was held in check by the manacle around herthroat raucous laughter crowded in from everywhere at once set her on poised to flee 
 a human guard touched her shoulder she looked it was he shook his head no imperceptibly her muscles relaxed the right moment he it was the right hand all the cards werehere han leia chewbaccaand old wild card lando he just leia revealing the hand before all the bets were out the stakes were just toohigh 
 in the pit below luke picked himself up off the floor he found he was now ina large cavelike dungeon the walls formed of craggy boulders pocked with lightlesscrevices the bones of countless animals were strewn over the of decayed flesh and twisted fear 
 feet above him in the ceiling he saw the iron grating through repugnant courtiers peered 
 the guard beside him suddenly began to scream uncontrollably as a door in theside of the cave slowly rumbled open with infinite calm luke surveyed hissurroundings as he removed his long robe down to his jedi tunic to give him morefreedom of movement he backed quickly to the wall and crouched there watching 
 out of the side passage emerged the giant rancor the size of an elephant itwas somehow reptilian somehow as unformed as a nightmare its huge screechingmouth was asymmetrical in its head its fangs and claws set all out of proportion itwas clearly a mutant and wild as all unreason 
 the guard picked up the pistol from the dirt where it had fallen and began firinglaser bursts at the hideous monster this only made the beast angrier it lumberedtoward the guard 
 the guard kept firing ignoring the laser blasts the beast grabbed the hystericalguard popped him into its slavering jaws and swallowed him in a gulp theaudience above cheered laughed and threw coins 
 the monster then turned and started for luke but the jedi knight leaped eightmeters straight up and grabbed onto the overhead grate the crowd began to over hand luke traversed the grating toward the corner of the cave strugglingto maintain his grip as the audience jeered his efforts one hand slipped on the oilygrid and he dangled precariously over the baying mutant 
 two jawas ran across the top of the grate they mashed fingers withtheir rifle butts once again the crowd roared its approval 
 the rancor pawed at luke from below but the jedi dangled just out of luke released his hold and dropped directly onto the eye of the howlingmonster he then tumbled to the floor 
 the rancor screamed in pain and stumbled swatting its own face to knock awaythe agony it ran in circles a few times then spotted luke again and came at stooped down to pick up the long bone of an earlier victim he brandished itbefore him the gallery above thought this was hilarious and hooted in delight 
 the monster grabbed luke and brought him up to its salivating mouth at thelast moment though luke wedged the bone deep in the mouth and jumpedto the floor as the beast began to gag the rancor bellowed and flailed headlong into a wall several rocks were dislodged starting an avalanchethat nearly buried luke as he crouched deep in a crevice near the floor the crowdclapped in unison 
 luke tried to clear his mind fear is a great cloud ben used to tell him itmakes the cold colder and the dark darker but let it rise and it will dissolve soluke let it rise past the clamor of the beast above him and examined ways he mightturn the sad rantings on itself 
 it was not an evil beast that much was clear had it been purely malicious itswickedness could easily have been turned on pure evil ben had said wasalways in the end but this monster dumb andmistreated hungry and in pain it lashed out at whatever came near for luke tohave looked on that as evil would only have been a projection of own would have been false and it certainly have helped him out ofthis situation 
 no he was going to have to keep his mind was just outwitthe savage brute to put it out of its misery 
 most preferable would have been to set it loose in court but that seemedunlikely he considered next giving the creature the means to do itself endits own pain unfortunately the creature was far too angered to comprehend thesolace of the void luke finally began studying the specific contours of the cave totry to come up with a specific plan 
 the rancor meanwhile had knocked the bone from its mouth and enraged wasscrabbling through the rubble of fallen rocks searching for luke luke though hisvision was partially obscured by the pile that still sheltered him could see now pastthe monster to a holding cave beyond that to a utility door if only hecould get to it 
 the rancor knocked away a boulder and spotted luke recoiling in the it reached in to pluck the boy out luke grabbed a large rock andsmashed it down on the finger as hard as he could as the rancor in pain once more luke ran for the holding cave 
 he reached the doorway and ran in before him a heavy barred gate blockedthe way beyond this gate the two keepers sat eating dinner they lookedup as luke entered then stood and walked toward the gate 
 luke turned around to see the monster coming angrily after him he turnedback to the gate and tried to open it the keepers poked at him with spears jabbed at him through the bars laughing and chewing their the rancor drew closer to the young jedi 
 luke backed against the side wall as the rancor reached in the room for he saw the control panel halfway up the opposite rancor began to enter the holding room closing for the kill when all at onceluke picked up a skull off the floor and hurled it at the panel 
 the panel exploded in a shower of sparks and the giant iron overhead restrainingdoor came crashing down on the head crushing it like an axe smashingthrough a ripe watermelon 
 those in the audience above gasped as one then were silent they were alltruly stunned at this bizarre turn of events they all looked to jabba who wasapoplectic with rage never had he felt such fury leia tried to hide her was unable to keep from smiling and this increased anger even he snapped at his guards get him out of there bring me solo and thewookiee they will all suffer for this outrage 
 in the pit below luke stood calmly as several of henchmen ran him in bonds and ushered him out 
 the rancor keeper wept openly and threw himself down on the body of his deadpet life would be a lonely proposition for him from that day 
 han and chewie were led before the steaming jabba han still squinted andstumbled every few feet threepio stood behind the hutt unbearable kept leia on a short tether stroking her hair to try to calm himself a constantmurmuring filled the room as the rabble speculated on what was going to happen towhom 
 with a flurry several lando luke inacross the room to give them passage the courtiers parted like an unruly luke too was standing before the throne he nudged solo with a to see you again old buddy 
 face lit up there seemed to be no end to the number of friends he keptbumping into luke are you in this mess now too 
 miss it skywalker smiled for just a moment he almost felt like aboy again 
 well how we doing han raised his eyebrows 
 same as always said luke 
 solo replied under his breath he felt one hundred percent like old a second later a bleak thought chilled him 
 leia is she 
 her eyes had been fixed on him from the moment entered the his spirit with her own when he spoke of her now sheresponded instantly calling from her place on throne all right but know how much longer i can hold off your slobbering friend here she wasintentionally cavalier to put solo at ease besides the sight of all her friends thereat once made her feel nearly invincible han luke chewie threepiowas skulking around somewhere trying to be forgotten leia almost laughed outloud almost punched jabba in the nose she could barely restrain herself shewanted to hug them all 
 suddenly jabba shouted the entire room was immediately silent talkdroid 
 timidly threepio stepped forward and with an embarrassed headgesture addressed the captives his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt hasdecreed that you are to be terminated immediately 
 solo said loudly good i hate long waits 
 your extreme offense against his majesty threepio went on demands themost torturous form of death 
 no sense in doing things halfway solo cracked jabba could be so and now with old goldenrod there making his pronouncements 
 no matter what else threepio simply hated being interrupted he collectedhimself nonetheless and continued you will be taken to the dune sea where youwill be thrown into the great pit of carkoon 
 han shrugged then turned to luke that sound too bad 
 threepio ignored the interruption the resting place of the in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as youslowly digest for a thousand years 
 on second thought we could pass on that solo reconsidered a thousandyears was a bit much 
 chewie barked his agreement 
 luke only smiled you should have bargained jabba this is the lastmistake ever make luke was unable to suppress the satisfaction in his found jabba leech of the galaxy sucking the life from whatever hetouched luke wanted to burn the villain and so was actually rather glad jabba hadrefused to now luke would get his wish precisely of course hisprimary objective was to free his friends whom he loved dearly it was this concernthat guided him now above all else but in the process to free the universe of thisgangster was a prospect that tinted purpose with an satisfaction 
 jabba chortled evilly take them away at last a bit of pure pleasure on anotherwise dreary the sarlacc was the only thing he enjoyed as much asfeeding the rancor poor rancor 
 a loud cheer rose from the crowd as the prisoners were carried off leia lookedafter them with great concern but when she caught a glimpse of face she wasstirred to see it still fixed in a broad genuine smile she sighed deeply to expel herdoubts 
 giant antigravity sail barge glided slowly over the endless dune iron hull creaked in the slight breeze each puff of wind coughing intothe two huge sails as if even nature suffered some terminal malaise wherever it camenear jabba he was belowdecks now with most of his court hiding the decay of hisspirit from the cleansing sun 
 alongside the barge two small skiffs floated in an escort six scruffy soldiers the other a gun skiff containing the prisoners luke they were all in bonds and surrounded by armed weequays and lando calrissian 
 barada was the sort and not likely to let anything get out of carried a as if he wanted nothing more than to hear it speak 
 the weequays were an odd sort they were brothers leathery and bald savefor a tribal braided and worn to the side no one was certain whetherweequay was the name of their tribe or their species or whether all in their tribewere brothers or all were named weequays it was known only that these two werecalled by this name and that they treated all other creatures indifferently with eachother they were gentle even tender but like barada they seemed anxious for theprisoners to misbehave 
 and lando of course remained silent for an opportunity thisreminded him of the lithium scam run on pesmenben salted thedunes there with lithium carbonate to con this imperial governor into leasing theplanet lando posing as a nonunion mine guard had made the governor lie facedown in the bottom of the boat and throw his bribe overboard when the unionofficials raided them gotten away on that one lando expectedthis job would go much the same except they might have to throw the guardsoverboard as well 
 han kept his ear tuned for his eyes were still useless he spoke with recklessdisregard to put the guards at get them used to his talking and moving sowhen the time came for him really to move be a critical fraction behind hismark and of spoke just to hear himself speak 
 i think my sight is getting better he said squinting over the sand instead ofbig dark blur i see a big bright blur 
 believe me not missing anything luke smiled i grew up here 
 luke thought of his youth on tatooine living on his farm cruising in landspeeder with his few of other settlers sitting their ownlonely outposts nothing ever to do here really for man or boy but cruise themonotonous dunes and try to avoid the peevish tusken raiders who guarded the sandas if it were luke knew this place 
 met kenobi ben kenobi the hermit lived in thewilderness since nobody knew when the man first shown luke the way ofthe jedi 
 luke thought of him now with great love and great sorrow for ben was morethan anyone the agent of discoveries and discoveries of losses 
 ben had taken luke to mos eisley the pirate city on the western face of the cantina where first met han solo and chewbacca the wookiee takenhim there after imperial stormtroopers had murdered uncle owen and aunt for the fugitive droids artoo and threepio 
 how it had all started for luke here on tatooine like a recurring dreamhe knew this place and he had sworn then that he would never return 
 i grew up here he repeated softly 
 and now going die here solo replied 
 i planning on it luke shook himself out of his reverie 
 if this is your big plan so far not crazy about it 
 palace was too well guarded i had to get you out of there just stayclose to chewie and lando take care of everything 
 i can hardly wait solo had a sinking feeling this grand escape depended thinking he was a questionable premise at best considering it was anextinct brotherhood that had used a force he really believe in anyway a fastship and a good blaster are what han believed in and he wished he had them now 
 jabba sat in the main cabin of the sail barge surrounded by his entire party at the palace was simply continuing in result being a slightlywobblier brand of in the nature of a prelynching celebration soblood lust and belligerence were testing new levels 
 threepio was way out of his depth at the moment he was being forced totranslate an argument between ephant mon and concerning a point ofquark warfare that was marginally beyond him ephant mon a bulky uprightpachydermoid with an ugly betusked snout was taking to way ofthinking an untenable position however on his shoulder sat salacious crumb theinsane little reptilian monkey who had the habit of repeating verbatim everythingephant said thereby effectively doubling the weight of argument 
 ephant concluded the oration with a typically bellicose avowal woossiejawamba boog 
 threepio really want to translate this to the was already dunk as a spicer but he did 
 all three eyes dilated in fury backawa backawa without furtherpreamble he punched ephant mon in the snout sending him flying into a school ofsquid heads 
 felt this response needed no translation and took the opportunity toslip to he promptly bumped into a small droid serving drinks thedrinks spilled everywhere 
 the stubby little droid let out a fluent series of irate beeps toots to threepio instantly he looked down in utter what are you doing here 
 doooweep chwhrrrrree bedzhng 
 i can see serving drinks but this place is dangerous goingto execute master luke and if not careful us too 
 artoo bit nonchalantly as far as threepio was concerned i wishi had your confidence he replied glumly 
 jabba chuckled to see ephant mon go loved a good beating heespecially loved to see strength crumble to see the proud fall 
 he tugged with his swollen fingers on the chain attached to princess the more resistance he met with the more he drawn thestruggling princess close to him once more 
 stay too far my lovely soon you will begin to appreciate me hepulled her very near and forced her to drink from his glass 
 leia opened her mouth and she closed her mind it was disgusting of there were worse things and in any case this last 
 the worse things she knew well her standard of comparison was the been tortured by darth vader she had almost broken the dark lord neverknew how close come to extracting the information he wanted from her thelocation of the rebel base he had captured her just after managed to sendartoo and threepio for her taken her to the death star injected herwith chemicalsand tortured her 
 tortured her body first with his efficient needles pressure electrojabbers endured these pains as she now endured a natural inner strength 
 she slid a few feet away from jabba now as his attention to peer out the slats in the louvered windows to squint through thedusty sunlight at the skiff on which her rescuers were being carried 
 it was stopping 
 the whole convoy was stopping in fact over a huge sand pit the sail bargemoved to one side of the giant depression with the escort skiff the skiffhovered directly over the pit though perhaps twenty feet in the air 
 at the bottom of the deep cone of sand a repulsive hole puckered almost unmoving the hole was eight feet in perimeter clustered with three rows of teeth sandstuck to the mucus that lined the sides of the opening occasionally sliding into theblack cavity at the center 
 this was the mouth of the sarlacc 
 an iron plank was extended over the side of the prisoners skiff two guardsuntied bonds and shoved him gruffly out onto the plank straight above theorifice in the sand now beginning to undulate in peristaltic movement and salivatewith increased mucus secretion as it smelled the meat it was about to receive 
 jabba moved his party up to the observation deck 
 luke rubbed his wrists to restore circulation the heat shimmering off thedesert warmed his finally this would always be his home born and bredin a bantha patch he saw leia standing at the rail of the big barge and winked back 
 jabba motioned threepio to his side then mumbled orders to the golden stepped up to the comlink jabba raised his arm and the whole motleyarray of intergalactic pirated fell silent voice arose amplified by theloudspeaker 
 his excellency hopes you will die honorably threepio announced mislaid thecorrect program nonetheless he was a droid his functions well only no free will please he shook his head and continued butshould any of you wish to beg for mercy jabba will now listen to your pleas 
 han stepped forward to give the bloated slime pot his last thoughts in case allelse failed you tell that slimy piece of filth 
 unfortunately han was facing into the desert away from the sail reached over and turned solo around so he was now properly facing thepiece of filth he was addressing 
 han nodded without stopping filth get no such pleasurefrom us 
 chewie made a few growly noises of general agreement 
 luke was ready jabba this is your last chance he shouted free us ordie he shot a quick look to lando who moved unobtrusively toward the back ofthe skiff this was it lando just toss the guards overboard and takeoff under nose 
 the monsters on the barge roared with laughter artoo during this silently up the ramp to the side of upper deck 
 jabba raised his hand and his minions were quiet sure right myyoung jedi friend he smiled then he turned his thumb down put him in 
 the spectators cheered as luke was prodded to the edge of the plank byweequay luke looked up at artoo standing alone by the rail and flipped the littledroid a jaunty salute at that prearranged signal a flap slid open in domedhead and a projectile shot high into the air and curved in a gentle arc over the desert 
 luke jumped off the plank another bloodthirsty cheer went up in less than asecond though luke had spun around in freefall caught the end of the plank with hisfingertips the thin metal bent wildly from his weight paused near to catapulted him up in he did a complete flip and dropped down in themiddle of the spot just left only now behind the confused he extended his arm to his side palm suddenly his artoo had shot sailing toward him dropped neatly into his open hand 
 with jedi speed luke ignited his sword and attacked the guard at the the plank sending him screaming overboard into the twitching mouth of thesarlacc 
 the other guards swarmed toward luke grimly he waded into flashing 
 his own his he had lost his in the duel withdarth vader in which lost his hand as well darth vader who had told luke hewas his father 
 but this lightsaber luke had fashioned himself in abandonedhut on the other side of with the old master tools and with love and craft and dire need he wielded it now as if it were fused to hishand as if it were an extension of his own arm this lightsaber truly was 
 he cut through the onslaught like a light dissolving shadow 
 lando grappled with the helmsman trying to seize the controls of the laser pistol fired blasting the nearby panel and the skiff lurched tothe side throwing another guard into the pit knocking everyone else into a pile on thedeck luke picked himself up and ran toward the helmsman lightsaber raised thecreature retreated at the overpowering sight stumbledand he too went over theedge into the maw 
 the bewildered guard landed in the soft sandy slope of the pit and began aninexorable slide down toward the toothy viscous opening he clawed desperately atthe sand screaming suddenly a muscled tentacle oozed out of the up the caked sand coiled tightly around the ankle and pulledhim into the hole with a grotesques slurp 
 all this happened in a matter of seconds when he saw what was exploded in a rage and yelled furious commands at those around him in amoment there was general uproar with creatures running through every door itwas during this directionless confusion that leia acted 
 she jumped onto throne grabbed the chain which enslaved her andwrapped it around his bulbous throat then she dove off the other side of thesupport pulling the chain violently in her grasp the small metal rings buriedthemselves in the loose folds of the neck like a garrote 
 with a strength beyond her own strength she pulled he bucked with his hugetorso nearly breaking her fingers nearly yanking her arms from their sockets hecould get no leverage his bulk was too unwieldy but just his sheer mass wasalmost enough to break any mere physical restraint 
 yet hold was not merely physical she closed of her eyes closed out thepain in her hands focused all of her all it was able to the breath from the horrid creature 
 she pulled she sweated she visualized the chain digging millimeter bymillimeter deeper into jabba wildly thrashed frantically twistedfrom this least expected of foes 
 with a last gasping effort jabba tensed every muscle and lurched forward hisreptilian eyes began to bulge from their sockets as the chain tightened his oily tongueflopped from his mouth his thick tail twitched in spasms of effort until he finallylay 
 leia sat about trying to free herself from the chain at her neck while outside thebattle began to rage 
 boba fett ignited his rocket pack leaped into the air and with a single effortflew down from the barge to the skiff just as luke finished freeing han and chewiefrom their bonds boba aimed his laser gun at luke but before he could fire theyoung jedi spun around sweeping his lightsword in an arc that sliced the gun in half 
 a series of blasts suddenly erupted from the large cannon on the upper deck ofthe barge hitting the skiff broadside and rocking it forty degrees askew landograbbed a broken strut and dangled desperately above the sarlacc thisdevelopment was definitely not in his game plan and he vowed to himself neveragain to get involved in a con that he run from start to finish 
 the skiff took another direct hit from the deck gun throwing chewie andhan against the rail wounded the wookiee howled in pain luke looked over athis hairy friend whereupon boba fett taking advantage of that moment of a cable from out of his armored sleeve 
 the cable wrapped itself several times around luke pinning his arms to his sword arm now free only from the wrist down he bent his wrist so thelightsaber pointed straight upand then spun toward boba along the cable in amoment the lightsaber touched the end of the wire lasso cutting through it shrugged the cable away just as another blast hit the skiff knocking bobaunconscious to the deck unfortunately this explosion also dislodged the strut fromwhich lando was hanging sending him careening into the sarlacc pit luke wasshaken by the explosion but unhurt lando hit the sandy slope shouted for tried to scramble out the loose sand only tumbled him deeper toward thegaping hole lando closed his eyes and tried to think of all the ways he might givethe sarlacc a thousand years of indigestion he bet himself three to two he couldoutlast anybody else in the stomach maybe if he talked that last guard outof his uniform 
 move luke screamed but his attention was immediately diverted by theincoming second skiff full of guards firing their weapons 
 it was a jedi but it took the soldiers in the second skiff by outnumbered attack this drives the force of the enemy in toward jumped directly into the center of the skiff and immediately began decimatingthem in their midst with lightning sweeps of his lightsaber 
 back in the other boat chewie tried to untangle to his feet chewie barked athim trying to direct him toward a spear lying loose on the deck 
 lando screamed starting to slide closer to the glistening jaws he was agambling man but he have taken long odds on his chances of escape rightnow 
 move lando han called out coming then to is it chewie he swung his hands frantically over the deck as chewiegrowled directions guiding movements at last han locked onto the spear 
 boba fett stumbled up just then still a little dizzy from the exploding shell helooked over at the other skiff where luke was in a pitched battle with six one hand boba steadied himself on the rail with the other he aimed his weaponat luke 
 chewie barked at han 
 which way shouted solo chewie barked 
 the blinded space pirate swung his long spear in direction blocked the blow with his forearm again he aimed at luke get out of myway you blind fool he cursed solo 
 chewie barked frantically han swung his spear again this time in the oppositedirection landing the hit squarely in the middle of rocket pack 
 the impact caused the rocket to ignite boba blasted off unexpectedly shootingover the second skiff like a missile and ricocheting straight down into the pit hisarmored body slid quickly past lando and rolled without pause into the 
 rrgrrowrrbroo fro bo chewie growled 
 he did solo smiled i wish i could have seen that 
 a major hit from the barge deck gun flipped the skiff on its side sending hanand almost everything else overboard his foot caught on the railing him swinging precariously above the sarlacc the wounded wookieetenaciously held on to the twisted debris astern 
 luke finished going through his adversaries on the second skiff assessed theproblem quickly and leaped across the chasm of sand to the sheer metal side of thehuge barge slowly he began a climb up the hull toward the deckgun 
 meanwhile on the observation deck leia had been intermittently struggling tobreak the chain which bound her to the dead gangster and hiding behind his massivecarcass whenever some guard ran by she stretched her full length now trying toretrieve a discarded laser no avail fortunately artoo at last came to herrescue after having first lost his bearings and rolled down the wrong plank 
 he zipped up to her finally extended a cutting appendage from the side of hiscasing and sliced through her bonds 
 thanks artoo good work now get out of here 
 they raced for the door on the way they passed threepio lying on the as a giant tuberous hulk named hermi odle sat on him salaciouscrumb the reptilian crouched by head picking out thegolden right eye 
 no no not my eyes threepio screamed 
 artoo sent a bolt of charge into hermi backside sending him wailingthrough a window a similar flash blasted salacious to the ceiling from which come down threepio quickly rose his eye dangling from a sheaf of he and artoo hurriedly followed leia out the back door 
 the deck gun blasted the tilting skiff once more shaking out virtually everythingthat remained inside except chewbacca desperately holding on with his injuredarm he was stretching over the rail grasping the ankle of the dangling solo who turn sightlessly reaching down for the terrified calrissian lando had managed tostop his slippage by lying very still now every time he reached up for arm the loose sand slid him a fraction closer to the hungry hole hesure hoped solo still holding that silly business back on bespin against him 
 chewie barked another direction at han 
 yeah i know i can see a lot better must be all the blood rushing to myhead 
 great lando called up now could you just grow a few inches taller 
 the deck gunners on the barge were lining up this human chain in their sights forthe coup de grace when luke stepped in front of them laughing like a pirate lit his lightsaber before they could squeeze off a shot a moment later they weresmoking corpses 
 a company of guards suddenly rushed up the steps from the lower decks of the blasts shot lightsaber from his hand he ran down the deck butwas quickly surrounded two of the soldiers manned the deck gun again lukelooked at his hand the mechanism was complex that replaced his real hand which vader had cut off in their lastencounter 
 he flexed the mechanism it still worked 
 the deck gunners fired at the skiff below it hit to the side of the small shock wave almost knocked chewie loose but in tipping the boat further hanwas able to grab onto wrist 
 pull solo yelled at the wookiee 
 caught screamed calrissian he looked down in panic to see one of tentacles slowly wrap around his ankle talk about a wild keptchanging the rules every five minutes in this game tentacles what kind of oddswas anybody gonna give on tentacles very long he decided with a fatalistic and sticky 
 the deck gunners realigned their sights for the final kill but it was all over forthem before they could had commandeered the second deck gun at theother end of the ship with her first shot she blasted the rigging that stood betweenthe two deck guns with her second shot she wiped out the first deck gun 
 the explosions rocked the great barge momentarily distracting the five guardswho surrounded luke in that moment he reached out his hand and the on the deck ten feet away flew into it he leaped straight up as two guardsfired at laser bolts killed each other he ignited his blade in the air it as he came down mortally wounded the others 
 he yelled to leia across the deck point it down 
 she tilted the second deck gun into the deck and nodded to threepio at the rail 
 artoo beside him beeped wildly 
 i artoo threepio cried too far to jumpaaahhh 
 artoo butted the golden droid over the edge and then stepped off head over toward the sand 
 meanwhile the was continuing between the sarlacc and solo withbaron calrissian as the rope and the prize chewbacca held leg bracedhimself on the rail and succeeded in pulling a laser pistol out of the wreckage withhis other hand he aimed the gun toward lando then lowered it barking hisconcern 
 right lando called out too far 
 chewbacca gave it to him he took it with one hand still holding on to landowith the other 
 now wait a second pal lando protested i thought you were blind 
 better trust me solo assured him 
 do i have a choice hey a little higher please he lowered his head 
 han squintedpulled the triggerand scored a direct hit on the tentacle thewormy thing instantly released its grip slithering back into its own mouth 
 chewbacca pulled mightily drawing first solo back into the thenlando 
 luke meantime gathered leia up in his left arm with his right he grabbed ahold of a rope from the rigging of the half mast and with his foot kickedthe trigger of the second deck jumped into the air as the cannon explodedinto the deck 
 the two of them swung on the swaying rope all the way down to the escort skiff once there luke steered it over to the prison he helped chewbacca han and lando on board 
 the sail barge continued exploding behind them half of it was now on fire 
 luke guided the skiff around beside the barge where legs couldbe seen sticking straight up out of the sand beside them periscopewas the only part of his anatomy visible above the dune the skiff stopped justabove them and lowered a large electromagnet from its compartment in the with a loud clang the two droids shot out of the sand and locked to plate 
 ow groaned threepio 
 beeedoo dweet artoo agreed 
 in a few minutes they were all in the skiff together more or less in one for the first time they looked at one another and realized they were all in the skifftogether more or less in one piece there was a great long moment of crying and beeping then someone accidentally squeezed arm and he bellowed and then they all ran about securing the the perimeters looking for sailing away 
 the great sail barge settled slowly in a chain of explosions and violent the little skiff flew quietly off across the finally in abrilliant conflagration that was only partially diminished by the scorching afternoonlight of twin suns

 return of the jedi 
 ii 
 
 han strained to see her though he had the eyes of a newborn leia where arewe 
 palace got to get you out of here quick 
 he sat up shakily a not going to be much help 
 she looked at him a long moment her blinded traveled find him risked her life lost time needed sorely by the rebellion timeshe really afford to throw away on personal quests and private desiresbutshe loved him 
 tears filled her eyes make it she whispered 
 impulsively she embraced him and kissed him again he too was floodedwith emotion all at from the dead the beautiful princess filling his him from the teeth of the void he felt overwhelmed unable to to speak he held her tightly his blind eyes closed fast against all the sordidrealities that would come rushing in soon enough 
 sooner than that as it happened a repulsive squishing sound suddenly becameall too obvious behind them han opened his eyes but could still see nothing leialooked up to the alcove beyond and her gaze turned to an expression of horror forthe curtain had been drawn away and the entire area floor to ceiling was composedof a gallery of the most disgusting miscreants of 
 hand shot up to her mouth 
 what is it han pressed her something obviously was terribly wrong hestared into his own blackness 
 an obscene cackle rose from the other side of the alcove a huttese cackle 
 han held his head closed his eyes again as if to keep away the inevitable for justone more moment i know that laugh 
 the curtain on the far side was suddenly drawn open there sat jabba ishi boba and several guards they all laughed kept laughing laughed to punish 
 my my what a touching sight jabba purred han my boy your taste incompanions has improved even if your luck has not 
 even blind solo could slide into smooth talk easier than a i was on my way back to pay you when i got a little now iknow had our differences but sure we can work this out 
 this time jabba genuinely chuckled too late for that solo you mayhave been the best smuggler in the business but now bantha fodder he cutshort his smile and gestured to his guards take him 
 guards grabbed leia and han they dragged the corellian pirate off whileleia continued struggling where she was 
 i will decide how to kill him later jabba muttered 
 pay you triple solo called out jabba throwing away a be fool then he was gone 
 from the rank of guards lando quickly moved forward took hold of leia andattempted to lead her away 
 jabba stopped them wait bring her to me 
 lando and leia halted in lando looked tense uncertain what to quite time to move yet the odds still just right he knew he wasthe and an was something you had to know how toplay to win 
 be all right leia whispered 
 not so sure he replied but the moment was pasted there was nothingelse to be done now he and ishi tib the birdlizard dragged the young princess tojabba 
 threepio been watching everything from his place behind jabba couldwatch no more he turned away in dread 
 leia on the other hand stood tall before the loathsome monarch her anger ranhigh with all the galaxy by this petty scumdealer was more outrageous than shecould tolerate still she kept her voice calm for she was in the end a have powerful friends jabba you will soon regret this 
 sure sure the old gangster rumbled with glee but in the meantime iwill thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of your company 
 he pulled her eagerly to him until their faces were mere inches apart her bellypressed to his oily snake skin she thought about killing him outright then and she held her ire in check since the rest of these vermin might have killed herbefore she could escape with han better odds were sure to come later so sheswallowed hard and for the time being put up with this slimepot as best she could 
 threepio peeked out momentarily then immediately withdrew again oh watch 
 foul beast that he was jabba poked his fat dripping tongue out to the slopped a beastly kiss squarely on her mouth 
 han was thrown roughly into the dungeon cell the door crashed shut behind fell to the floor in the darkness then picked himself up and sat against the a few moments of pounding the ground with his fist he quieted down and triedto organize his thoughts 
 darkness well blast it blind is blind no use wishing for moondew on ameteorite only it was so frustrating coming out of like that saved bythe one person who 
 leia the star stomach dropped at the thought of what must behappening to her now if only he knew where he was tentatively he knocked onthe wall behind him solid rock 
 what could he do bargain maybe but what did he have to bargain question he did i ever have to have something before i couldbargain with it 
 what though money jabba had more than he could ever count could give jabba more pleasure than to defile the princess and kill solo were fact it look like they could get much worse 
 then he heard the growl a low formidable snarl from out of the denseblackness at the far corner of the cell the growl of a large and angry beast 
 the hair on arms stood on end quickly he rose his back to the like got company he muttered 
 the wild creature bellowed out an insane groawwwwr and raced straight atsolo grabbing him ferociously around the chest lifting him several feet into the off his breathing 
 han was totally motionless for several long believe hisears chewie is that you 
 the giant wookiee barked with joy 
 for the second time in an hour solo was overcome with happiness but this wasan entirely different matter all right all right wait a second crushing me 
 chewbacca put his friend down han reached up and scratched his chewie cooed like a pup 
 okay going on around here anyway han was instantly back on was unbelievably good was someone he could make a plan not only someone but his most loyal friend in the galaxy 
 chewie filled him in at length arh arhaghh shpahrgh rahr aurowwwrahrahgrop rahp rah 
 plan what is he doing here 
 chewie barked extensively 
 han shook his head is luke crazy you listen to him that even take care of himself let alone rescue anyone 
 rowr ahragh awf ahraroww rowh rohngr grgrff rf rf 
 a jedi knight come on out of it for a little while and everybody getsdelusions 
 chewbacca growled insistently 
 han nodded dubiously in the blackness believe it when i see it hecommented walking stoutly into the wall if excuse the expression 
 the iron main gate of palace scraped open harshly oiled only with sandand time standing outside in the dusty gale staring into the black cavernousentranceway was luke skywalker 
 he was clad in the robe of the jedi cassock bore neithergun nor lightsaber he stood loosely without bravado taking a measure of the placebefore entering he was a man now wiser like a more from loss thanfrom years loss of illusions loss of dependency loss of friends to war lossof sleep to stress loss of laughter loss of his hand 
 but of all his losses the greatest was that which came from knowledge and fromthe deep recognition that he could never what he knew so many things hewished never learned he had aged with the weight of this knowledge 
 knowledge brought benefits of course he was less impulsive had given him perspective a framework in which to fit the events of is a lattice of spatial and time coordinates spanning his existence backearliest memories ahead to a hundred alternative futures a lattice of depths andconundrums and interstices through which luke could peer at any new event in hislife peer at it with perspective a lattice of shadows and corners rolling back to thevanishing point on the horizon of mind and all these shadow boxes that lentsuch perspective to thingswell this lattice gave his life a certain darkness 
 nothing of substance of in any case some would have said thisshading gave a depth to his personality where before it had been thin such a suggestion probably would have come from jaded a jaded time nonetheless there was a certain darkness now 
 there were other advantages to knowledge rationality etiquette of them all was a true sword but it did have its advantages 
 furthermore he was skilled in the craft of the jedi now where before beenmerely precocious 
 he was more aware now 
 these were all desirable attributes to be sure and luke knew as well as anyonethat all things alive must grow still it carried a certain sadness the sum of all thisknowledge a certain sense of regret but who could afford to be a boy in timessuch as these 
 resolutely luke strode into the arching hallway 
 almost immediately two gamorreans stepped up blocking his path one spokein voice that did not invite debate no chuba 
 luke raised his hand and pointed at the guards before either could draw aweapon they were both clutching their own throats choking gasping they fell totheir knees 
 luke lowered his hand and walked on the guards suddenly able to breatheagain slumped to the steps they follow 
 around the next corner luke was met by bib fortuna fortuna began speakingas he approached the young jedi but luke never broke stride so bib had to reversehis direction in and hurry along with skywalker in order to carry onconversation 
 you must be the one called skywalker his excellency will not see you 
 i will speak to jabba now luke spoke evenly never slowing they passedseveral more guards at the next crossing who fell in behind them 
 the great jabba is asleep bib explained he has instructed me to tell youthere will be no bargains 
 luke stopped suddenly and stared at bib he locked eyes with the his hand slightly took a minutely inward turn you will take me to 
 bib paused tilted his head a fraction what were his instructions oh he remembered i will take you to jabba now 
 he turned and walked down the twisting corridor that led to the throne followed him into the gloom 
 you serve your master well he whispered in ear 
 i serve my master well bib nodded with conviction 
 you are sure to be rewarded luke added 
 bib smiled smugly i am sure to be rewarded 
 as luke and bib entered court the level of tumult dropped precipitouslyas if presence had a cooling effect everyone felt a change 
 the lieutenant and the jedi knight approached the throne luke saw leiaseated there now by belly she was chained at the neck and dressed in theskimpy costume of a dancing girl he could feel her pain immediately from acrossthe he said nothing even look at her shut her anguish completelyout of his mind for he needed to focus his attention entirely on jabba 
 leia for her part sensed this at once she closed her mind to luke to keepherself from distracting him yet at the same time she kept it open ready to receiveany sliver of information she might need to act she felt charged with possibilities 
 threepio peeked out from behind the throne as bib walked up for the firsttime in many days he scanned his hope program ah at last master to take me away from all this he beamed 
 bib stood proudly before jabba master i present luke skywalker jediknight 
 i told you not to admit him the growled in huttese 
 i must be allowed to speak luke spoke quietly though his words were heardthroughout the hall 
 he must be allowed to speak bob concurred thoughtfully 
 jabba furious bashed bib across the face and sent his reeling to the fool using an old jedi mind trick 
 luke let all the rest of the motley horde that surrounded him melt into therecesses of his consciousness to let jabba fill his mind totally you will bringcaptain solo and the wookiee to me 
 jabba smiled grimly your mind powers will not work on me boy i am notaffected by your human thought pattern then as an afterthought i was killingyour kind when being a jedi meant something 
 luke altered his stance somewhat internally and externally nevertheless iam taking captain solo and his friends you can either profit from thisor bedestroyed your choice but i warn you not to underestimate my powers hespoke in his own language which jabba well understood 
 jabba laughed the laugh of a lion cautioned by a mouse 
 threepio who had been observing this interplay intently leaned forward towhisper to luke master standing a guard abruptly restrained theconcerned droid though and pulled him back to his place 
 jabba cut short his laugh with a scowl there will be no bargain young shall enjoy watching you die 
 luke raised his hand a pistol jumped out of the holster of a nearby guard andlanded snugly in the palm luke pointed the weapon at jabba 
 jabba spat boscka 
 the floor suddenly dropped away sending luke and his guard crashing into thepit below the trap door immediately closed again all the beasts of the courtrushed to the and looked down 
 luke yelled leia she felt part of her self torn away pulled down into thepit with him she started forward but was held in check by the manacle around herthroat raucous laughter crowded in from everywhere at once set her on poised to flee 
 a human guard touched her shoulder she looked it was he shook his head no imperceptibly her muscles relaxed the right moment he it was the right hand all the cards werehere han leia chewbaccaand old wild card lando he just leia revealing the hand before all the bets were out the stakes were just toohigh 
 in the pit below luke picked himself up off the floor he found he was now ina large cavelike dungeon the walls formed of craggy boulders pocked with lightlesscrevices the bones of countless animals were strewn over the of decayed flesh and twisted fear 
 feet above him in the ceiling he saw the iron grating through repugnant courtiers peered 
 the guard beside him suddenly began to scream uncontrollably as a door in theside of the cave slowly rumbled open with infinite calm luke surveyed hissurroundings as he removed his long robe down to his jedi tunic to give him morefreedom of movement he backed quickly to the wall and crouched there watching 
 out of the side passage emerged the giant rancor the size of an elephant itwas somehow reptilian somehow as unformed as a nightmare its huge screechingmouth was asymmetrical in its head its fangs and claws set all out of proportion itwas clearly a mutant and wild as all unreason 
 the guard picked up the pistol from the dirt where it had fallen and began firinglaser bursts at the hideous monster this only made the beast angrier it lumberedtoward the guard 
 the guard kept firing ignoring the laser blasts the beast grabbed the hystericalguard popped him into its slavering jaws and swallowed him in a gulp theaudience above cheered laughed and threw coins 
 the monster then turned and started for luke but the jedi knight leaped eightmeters straight up and grabbed onto the overhead grate the crowd began to over hand luke traversed the grating toward the corner of the cave strugglingto maintain his grip as the audience jeered his efforts one hand slipped on the oilygrid and he dangled precariously over the baying mutant 
 two jawas ran across the top of the grate they mashed fingers withtheir rifle butts once again the crowd roared its approval 
 the rancor pawed at luke from below but the jedi dangled just out of luke released his hold and dropped directly onto the eye of the howlingmonster he then tumbled to the floor 
 the rancor screamed in pain and stumbled swatting its own face to knock awaythe agony it ran in circles a few times then spotted luke again and came at stooped down to pick up the long bone of an earlier victim he brandished itbefore him the gallery above thought this was hilarious and hooted in delight 
 the monster grabbed luke and brought him up to its salivating mouth at thelast moment though luke wedged the bone deep in the mouth and jumpedto the floor as the beast began to gag the rancor bellowed and flailed headlong into a wall several rocks were dislodged starting an avalanchethat nearly buried luke as he crouched deep in a crevice near the floor the crowdclapped in unison 
 luke tried to clear his mind fear is a great cloud ben used to tell him itmakes the cold colder and the dark darker but let it rise and it will dissolve soluke let it rise past the clamor of the beast above him and examined ways he mightturn the sad rantings on itself 
 it was not an evil beast that much was clear had it been purely malicious itswickedness could easily have been turned on pure evil ben had said wasalways in the end but this monster dumb andmistreated hungry and in pain it lashed out at whatever came near for luke tohave looked on that as evil would only have been a projection of own would have been false and it certainly have helped him out ofthis situation 
 no he was going to have to keep his mind was just outwitthe savage brute to put it out of its misery 
 most preferable would have been to set it loose in court but that seemedunlikely he considered next giving the creature the means to do itself endits own pain unfortunately the creature was far too angered to comprehend thesolace of the void luke finally began studying the specific contours of the cave totry to come up with a specific plan 
 the rancor meanwhile had knocked the bone from its mouth and enraged wasscrabbling through the rubble of fallen rocks searching for luke luke though hisvision was partially obscured by the pile that still sheltered him could see now pastthe monster to a holding cave beyond that to a utility door if only hecould get to it 
 the rancor knocked away a boulder and spotted luke recoiling in the it reached in to pluck the boy out luke grabbed a large rock andsmashed it down on the finger as hard as he could as the rancor in pain once more luke ran for the holding cave 
 he reached the doorway and ran in before him a heavy barred gate blockedthe way beyond this gate the two keepers sat eating dinner they lookedup as luke entered then stood and walked toward the gate 
 luke turned around to see the monster coming angrily after him he turnedback to the gate and tried to open it the keepers poked at him with spears jabbed at him through the bars laughing and chewing their the rancor drew closer to the young jedi 
 luke backed against the side wall as the rancor reached in the room for he saw the control panel halfway up the opposite rancor began to enter the holding room closing for the kill when all at onceluke picked up a skull off the floor and hurled it at the panel 
 the panel exploded in a shower of sparks and the giant iron overhead restrainingdoor came crashing down on the head crushing it like an axe smashingthrough a ripe watermelon 
 those in the audience above gasped as one then were silent they were alltruly stunned at this bizarre turn of events they all looked to jabba who wasapoplectic with rage never had he felt such fury leia tried to hide her was unable to keep from smiling and this increased anger even he snapped at his guards get him out of there bring me solo and thewookiee they will all suffer for this outrage 
 in the pit below luke stood calmly as several of henchmen ran him in bonds and ushered him out 
 the rancor keeper wept openly and threw himself down on the body of his deadpet life would be a lonely proposition for him from that day 
 han and chewie were led before the steaming jabba han still squinted andstumbled every few feet threepio stood behind the hutt unbearable kept leia on a short tether stroking her hair to try to calm himself a constantmurmuring filled the room as the rabble speculated on what was going to happen towhom 
 with a flurry several lando luke inacross the room to give them passage the courtiers parted like an unruly luke too was standing before the throne he nudged solo with a to see you again old buddy 
 face lit up there seemed to be no end to the number of friends he keptbumping into luke are you in this mess now too 
 miss it skywalker smiled for just a moment he almost felt like aboy again 
 well how we doing han raised his eyebrows 
 same as always said luke 
 solo replied under his breath he felt one hundred percent like old a second later a bleak thought chilled him 
 leia is she 
 her eyes had been fixed on him from the moment entered the his spirit with her own when he spoke of her now sheresponded instantly calling from her place on throne all right but know how much longer i can hold off your slobbering friend here she wasintentionally cavalier to put solo at ease besides the sight of all her friends thereat once made her feel nearly invincible han luke chewie threepiowas skulking around somewhere trying to be forgotten leia almost laughed outloud almost punched jabba in the nose she could barely restrain herself shewanted to hug them all 
 suddenly jabba shouted the entire room was immediately silent talkdroid 
 timidly threepio stepped forward and with an embarrassed headgesture addressed the captives his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt hasdecreed that you are to be terminated immediately 
 solo said loudly good i hate long waits 
 your extreme offense against his majesty threepio went on demands themost torturous form of death 
 no sense in doing things halfway solo cracked jabba could be so and now with old goldenrod there making his pronouncements 
 no matter what else threepio simply hated being interrupted he collectedhimself nonetheless and continued you will be taken to the dune sea where youwill be thrown into the great pit of carkoon 
 han shrugged then turned to luke that sound too bad 
 threepio ignored the interruption the resting place of the in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as youslowly digest for a thousand years 
 on second thought we could pass on that solo reconsidered a thousandyears was a bit much 
 chewie barked his agreement 
 luke only smiled you should have bargained jabba this is the lastmistake ever make luke was unable to suppress the satisfaction in his found jabba leech of the galaxy sucking the life from whatever hetouched luke wanted to burn the villain and so was actually rather glad jabba hadrefused to now luke would get his wish precisely of course hisprimary objective was to free his friends whom he loved dearly it was this concernthat guided him now above all else but in the process to free the universe of thisgangster was a prospect that tinted purpose with an satisfaction 
 jabba chortled evilly take them away at last a bit of pure pleasure on anotherwise dreary the sarlacc was the only thing he enjoyed as much asfeeding the rancor poor rancor 
 a loud cheer rose from the crowd as the prisoners were carried off leia lookedafter them with great concern but when she caught a glimpse of face she wasstirred to see it still fixed in a broad genuine smile she sighed deeply to expel herdoubts 
 giant antigravity sail barge glided slowly over the endless dune iron hull creaked in the slight breeze each puff of wind coughing intothe two huge sails as if even nature suffered some terminal malaise wherever it camenear jabba he was belowdecks now with most of his court hiding the decay of hisspirit from the cleansing sun 
 alongside the barge two small skiffs floated in an escort six scruffy soldiers the other a gun skiff containing the prisoners luke they were all in bonds and surrounded by armed weequays and lando calrissian 
 barada was the sort and not likely to let anything get out of carried a as if he wanted nothing more than to hear it speak 
 the weequays were an odd sort they were brothers leathery and bald savefor a tribal braided and worn to the side no one was certain whetherweequay was the name of their tribe or their species or whether all in their tribewere brothers or all were named weequays it was known only that these two werecalled by this name and that they treated all other creatures indifferently with eachother they were gentle even tender but like barada they seemed anxious for theprisoners to misbehave 
 and lando of course remained silent for an opportunity thisreminded him of the lithium scam run on pesmenben salted thedunes there with lithium carbonate to con this imperial governor into leasing theplanet lando posing as a nonunion mine guard had made the governor lie facedown in the bottom of the boat and throw his bribe overboard when the unionofficials raided them gotten away on that one lando expectedthis job would go much the same except they might have to throw the guardsoverboard as well 
 han kept his ear tuned for his eyes were still useless he spoke with recklessdisregard to put the guards at get them used to his talking and moving sowhen the time came for him really to move be a critical fraction behind hismark and of spoke just to hear himself speak 
 i think my sight is getting better he said squinting over the sand instead ofbig dark blur i see a big bright blur 
 believe me not missing anything luke smiled i grew up here 
 luke thought of his youth on tatooine living on his farm cruising in landspeeder with his few of other settlers sitting their ownlonely outposts nothing ever to do here really for man or boy but cruise themonotonous dunes and try to avoid the peevish tusken raiders who guarded the sandas if it were luke knew this place 
 met kenobi ben kenobi the hermit lived in thewilderness since nobody knew when the man first shown luke the way ofthe jedi 
 luke thought of him now with great love and great sorrow for ben was morethan anyone the agent of discoveries and discoveries of losses 
 ben had taken luke to mos eisley the pirate city on the western face of the cantina where first met han solo and chewbacca the wookiee takenhim there after imperial stormtroopers had murdered uncle owen and aunt for the fugitive droids artoo and threepio 
 how it had all started for luke here on tatooine like a recurring dreamhe knew this place and he had sworn then that he would never return 
 i grew up here he repeated softly 
 and now going die here solo replied 
 i planning on it luke shook himself out of his reverie 
 if this is your big plan so far not crazy about it 
 palace was too well guarded i had to get you out of there just stayclose to chewie and lando take care of everything 
 i can hardly wait solo had a sinking feeling this grand escape depended thinking he was a questionable premise at best considering it was anextinct brotherhood that had used a force he really believe in anyway a fastship and a good blaster are what han believed in and he wished he had them now 
 jabba sat in the main cabin of the sail barge surrounded by his entire party at the palace was simply continuing in result being a slightlywobblier brand of in the nature of a prelynching celebration soblood lust and belligerence were testing new levels 
 threepio was way out of his depth at the moment he was being forced totranslate an argument between ephant mon and concerning a point ofquark warfare that was marginally beyond him ephant mon a bulky uprightpachydermoid with an ugly betusked snout was taking to way ofthinking an untenable position however on his shoulder sat salacious crumb theinsane little reptilian monkey who had the habit of repeating verbatim everythingephant said thereby effectively doubling the weight of argument 
 ephant concluded the oration with a typically bellicose avowal woossiejawamba boog 
 threepio really want to translate this to the was already dunk as a spicer but he did 
 all three eyes dilated in fury backawa backawa without furtherpreamble he punched ephant mon in the snout sending him flying into a school ofsquid heads 
 felt this response needed no translation and took the opportunity toslip to he promptly bumped into a small droid serving drinks thedrinks spilled everywhere 
 the stubby little droid let out a fluent series of irate beeps toots to threepio instantly he looked down in utter what are you doing here 
 doooweep chwhrrrrree bedzhng 
 i can see serving drinks but this place is dangerous goingto execute master luke and if not careful us too 
 artoo bit nonchalantly as far as threepio was concerned i wishi had your confidence he replied glumly 
 jabba chuckled to see ephant mon go loved a good beating heespecially loved to see strength crumble to see the proud fall 
 he tugged with his swollen fingers on the chain attached to princess the more resistance he met with the more he drawn thestruggling princess close to him once more 
 stay too far my lovely soon you will begin to appreciate me hepulled her very near and forced her to drink from his glass 
 leia opened her mouth and she closed her mind it was disgusting of there were worse things and in any case this last 
 the worse things she knew well her standard of comparison was the been tortured by darth vader she had almost broken the dark lord neverknew how close come to extracting the information he wanted from her thelocation of the rebel base he had captured her just after managed to sendartoo and threepio for her taken her to the death star injected herwith chemicalsand tortured her 
 tortured her body first with his efficient needles pressure electrojabbers endured these pains as she now endured a natural inner strength 
 she slid a few feet away from jabba now as his attention to peer out the slats in the louvered windows to squint through thedusty sunlight at the skiff on which her rescuers were being carried 
 it was stopping 
 the whole convoy was stopping in fact over a huge sand pit the sail bargemoved to one side of the giant depression with the escort skiff the skiffhovered directly over the pit though perhaps twenty feet in the air 
 at the bottom of the deep cone of sand a repulsive hole puckered almost unmoving the hole was eight feet in perimeter clustered with three rows of teeth sandstuck to the mucus that lined the sides of the opening occasionally sliding into theblack cavity at the center 
 this was the mouth of the sarlacc 
 an iron plank was extended over the side of the prisoners skiff two guardsuntied bonds and shoved him gruffly out onto the plank straight above theorifice in the sand now beginning to undulate in peristaltic movement and salivatewith increased mucus secretion as it smelled the meat it was about to receive 
 jabba moved his party up to the observation deck 
 luke rubbed his wrists to restore circulation the heat shimmering off thedesert warmed his finally this would always be his home born and bredin a bantha patch he saw leia standing at the rail of the big barge and winked back 
 jabba motioned threepio to his side then mumbled orders to the golden stepped up to the comlink jabba raised his arm and the whole motleyarray of intergalactic pirated fell silent voice arose amplified by theloudspeaker 
 his excellency hopes you will die honorably threepio announced mislaid thecorrect program nonetheless he was a droid his functions well only no free will please he shook his head and continued butshould any of you wish to beg for mercy jabba will now listen to your pleas 
 han stepped forward to give the bloated slime pot his last thoughts in case allelse failed you tell that slimy piece of filth 
 unfortunately han was facing into the desert away from the sail reached over and turned solo around so he was now properly facing thepiece of filth he was addressing 
 han nodded without stopping filth get no such pleasurefrom us 
 chewie made a few growly noises of general agreement 
 luke was ready jabba this is your last chance he shouted free us ordie he shot a quick look to lando who moved unobtrusively toward the back ofthe skiff this was it lando just toss the guards overboard and takeoff under nose 
 the monsters on the barge roared with laughter artoo during this silently up the ramp to the side of upper deck 
 jabba raised his hand and his minions were quiet sure right myyoung jedi friend he smiled then he turned his thumb down put him in 
 the spectators cheered as luke was prodded to the edge of the plank byweequay luke looked up at artoo standing alone by the rail and flipped the littledroid a jaunty salute at that prearranged signal a flap slid open in domedhead and a projectile shot high into the air and curved in a gentle arc over the desert 
 luke jumped off the plank another bloodthirsty cheer went up in less than asecond though luke had spun around in freefall caught the end of the plank with hisfingertips the thin metal bent wildly from his weight paused near to catapulted him up in he did a complete flip and dropped down in themiddle of the spot just left only now behind the confused he extended his arm to his side palm suddenly his artoo had shot sailing toward him dropped neatly into his open hand 
 with jedi speed luke ignited his sword and attacked the guard at the the plank sending him screaming overboard into the twitching mouth of thesarlacc 
 the other guards swarmed toward luke grimly he waded into flashing 
 his own his he had lost his in the duel withdarth vader in which lost his hand as well darth vader who had told luke hewas his father 
 but this lightsaber luke had fashioned himself in abandonedhut on the other side of with the old master tools and with love and craft and dire need he wielded it now as if it were fused to hishand as if it were an extension of his own arm this lightsaber truly was 
 he cut through the onslaught like a light dissolving shadow 
 lando grappled with the helmsman trying to seize the controls of the laser pistol fired blasting the nearby panel and the skiff lurched tothe side throwing another guard into the pit knocking everyone else into a pile on thedeck luke picked himself up and ran toward the helmsman lightsaber raised thecreature retreated at the overpowering sight stumbledand he too went over theedge into the maw 
 the bewildered guard landed in the soft sandy slope of the pit and began aninexorable slide down toward the toothy viscous opening he clawed desperately atthe sand screaming suddenly a muscled tentacle oozed out of the up the caked sand coiled tightly around the ankle and pulledhim into the hole with a grotesques slurp 
 all this happened in a matter of seconds when he saw what was exploded in a rage and yelled furious commands at those around him in amoment there was general uproar with creatures running through every door itwas during this directionless confusion that leia acted 
 she jumped onto throne grabbed the chain which enslaved her andwrapped it around his bulbous throat then she dove off the other side of thesupport pulling the chain violently in her grasp the small metal rings buriedthemselves in the loose folds of the neck like a garrote 
 with a strength beyond her own strength she pulled he bucked with his hugetorso nearly breaking her fingers nearly yanking her arms from their sockets hecould get no leverage his bulk was too unwieldy but just his sheer mass wasalmost enough to break any mere physical restraint 
 yet hold was not merely physical she closed of her eyes closed out thepain in her hands focused all of her all it was able to the breath from the horrid creature 
 she pulled she sweated she visualized the chain digging millimeter bymillimeter deeper into jabba wildly thrashed frantically twistedfrom this least expected of foes 
 with a last gasping effort jabba tensed every muscle and lurched forward hisreptilian eyes began to bulge from their sockets as the chain tightened his oily tongueflopped from his mouth his thick tail twitched in spasms of effort until he finallylay 
 leia sat about trying to free herself from the chain at her neck while outside thebattle began to rage 
 boba fett ignited his rocket pack leaped into the air and with a single effortflew down from the barge to the skiff just as luke finished freeing han and chewiefrom their bonds boba aimed his laser gun at luke but before he could fire theyoung jedi spun around sweeping his lightsword in an arc that sliced the gun in half 
 a series of blasts suddenly erupted from the large cannon on the upper deck ofthe barge hitting the skiff broadside and rocking it forty degrees askew landograbbed a broken strut and dangled desperately above the sarlacc thisdevelopment was definitely not in his game plan and he vowed to himself neveragain to get involved in a con that he run from start to finish 
 the skiff took another direct hit from the deck gun throwing chewie andhan against the rail wounded the wookiee howled in pain luke looked over athis hairy friend whereupon boba fett taking advantage of that moment of a cable from out of his armored sleeve 
 the cable wrapped itself several times around luke pinning his arms to his sword arm now free only from the wrist down he bent his wrist so thelightsaber pointed straight upand then spun toward boba along the cable in amoment the lightsaber touched the end of the wire lasso cutting through it shrugged the cable away just as another blast hit the skiff knocking bobaunconscious to the deck unfortunately this explosion also dislodged the strut fromwhich lando was hanging sending him careening into the sarlacc pit luke wasshaken by the explosion but unhurt lando hit the sandy slope shouted for tried to scramble out the loose sand only tumbled him deeper toward thegaping hole lando closed his eyes and tried to think of all the ways he might givethe sarlacc a thousand years of indigestion he bet himself three to two he couldoutlast anybody else in the stomach maybe if he talked that last guard outof his uniform 
 move luke screamed but his attention was immediately diverted by theincoming second skiff full of guards firing their weapons 
 it was a jedi but it took the soldiers in the second skiff by outnumbered attack this drives the force of the enemy in toward jumped directly into the center of the skiff and immediately began decimatingthem in their midst with lightning sweeps of his lightsaber 
 back in the other boat chewie tried to untangle to his feet chewie barked athim trying to direct him toward a spear lying loose on the deck 
 lando screamed starting to slide closer to the glistening jaws he was agambling man but he have taken long odds on his chances of escape rightnow 
 move lando han called out coming then to is it chewie he swung his hands frantically over the deck as chewiegrowled directions guiding movements at last han locked onto the spear 
 boba fett stumbled up just then still a little dizzy from the exploding shell helooked over at the other skiff where luke was in a pitched battle with six one hand boba steadied himself on the rail with the other he aimed his weaponat luke 
 chewie barked at han 
 which way shouted solo chewie barked 
 the blinded space pirate swung his long spear in direction blocked the blow with his forearm again he aimed at luke get out of myway you blind fool he cursed solo 
 chewie barked frantically han swung his spear again this time in the oppositedirection landing the hit squarely in the middle of rocket pack 
 the impact caused the rocket to ignite boba blasted off unexpectedly shootingover the second skiff like a missile and ricocheting straight down into the pit hisarmored body slid quickly past lando and rolled without pause into the 
 rrgrrowrrbroo fro bo chewie growled 
 he did solo smiled i wish i could have seen that 
 a major hit from the barge deck gun flipped the skiff on its side sending hanand almost everything else overboard his foot caught on the railing him swinging precariously above the sarlacc the wounded wookieetenaciously held on to the twisted debris astern 
 luke finished going through his adversaries on the second skiff assessed theproblem quickly and leaped across the chasm of sand to the sheer metal side of thehuge barge slowly he began a climb up the hull toward the deckgun 
 meanwhile on the observation deck leia had been intermittently struggling tobreak the chain which bound her to the dead gangster and hiding behind his massivecarcass whenever some guard ran by she stretched her full length now trying toretrieve a discarded laser no avail fortunately artoo at last came to herrescue after having first lost his bearings and rolled down the wrong plank 
 he zipped up to her finally extended a cutting appendage from the side of hiscasing and sliced through her bonds 
 thanks artoo good work now get out of here 
 they raced for the door on the way they passed threepio lying on the as a giant tuberous hulk named hermi odle sat on him salaciouscrumb the reptilian crouched by head picking out thegolden right eye 
 no no not my eyes threepio screamed 
 artoo sent a bolt of charge into hermi backside sending him wailingthrough a window a similar flash blasted salacious to the ceiling from which come down threepio quickly rose his eye dangling from a sheaf of he and artoo hurriedly followed leia out the back door 
 the deck gun blasted the tilting skiff once more shaking out virtually everythingthat remained inside except chewbacca desperately holding on with his injuredarm he was stretching over the rail grasping the ankle of the dangling solo who turn sightlessly reaching down for the terrified calrissian lando had managed tostop his slippage by lying very still now every time he reached up for arm the loose sand slid him a fraction closer to the hungry hole hesure hoped solo still holding that silly business back on bespin against him 
 chewie barked another direction at han 
 yeah i know i can see a lot better must be all the blood rushing to myhead 
 great lando called up now could you just grow a few inches taller 
 the deck gunners on the barge were lining up this human chain in their sights forthe coup de grace when luke stepped in front of them laughing like a pirate lit his lightsaber before they could squeeze off a shot a moment later they weresmoking corpses 
 a company of guards suddenly rushed up the steps from the lower decks of the blasts shot lightsaber from his hand he ran down the deck butwas quickly surrounded two of the soldiers manned the deck gun again lukelooked at his hand the mechanism was complex that replaced his real hand which vader had cut off in their lastencounter 
 he flexed the mechanism it still worked 
 the deck gunners fired at the skiff below it hit to the side of the small shock wave almost knocked chewie loose but in tipping the boat further hanwas able to grab onto wrist 
 pull solo yelled at the wookiee 
 caught screamed calrissian he looked down in panic to see one of tentacles slowly wrap around his ankle talk about a wild keptchanging the rules every five minutes in this game tentacles what kind of oddswas anybody gonna give on tentacles very long he decided with a fatalistic and sticky 
 the deck gunners realigned their sights for the final kill but it was all over forthem before they could had commandeered the second deck gun at theother end of the ship with her first shot she blasted the rigging that stood betweenthe two deck guns with her second shot she wiped out the first deck gun 
 the explosions rocked the great barge momentarily distracting the five guardswho surrounded luke in that moment he reached out his hand and the on the deck ten feet away flew into it he leaped straight up as two guardsfired at laser bolts killed each other he ignited his blade in the air it as he came down mortally wounded the others 
 he yelled to leia across the deck point it down 
 she tilted the second deck gun into the deck and nodded to threepio at the rail 
 artoo beside him beeped wildly 
 i artoo threepio cried too far to jumpaaahhh 
 artoo butted the golden droid over the edge and then stepped off head over toward the sand 
 meanwhile the was continuing between the sarlacc and solo withbaron calrissian as the rope and the prize chewbacca held leg bracedhimself on the rail and succeeded in pulling a laser pistol out of the wreckage withhis other hand he aimed the gun toward lando then lowered it barking hisconcern 
 right lando called out too far 
 chewbacca gave it to him he took it with one hand still holding on to landowith the other 
 now wait a second pal lando protested i thought you were blind 
 better trust me solo assured him 
 do i have a choice hey a little higher please he lowered his head 
 han squintedpulled the triggerand scored a direct hit on the tentacle thewormy thing instantly released its grip slithering back into its own mouth 
 chewbacca pulled mightily drawing first solo back into the thenlando 
 luke meantime gathered leia up in his left arm with his right he grabbed ahold of a rope from the rigging of the half mast and with his foot kickedthe trigger of the second deck jumped into the air as the cannon explodedinto the deck 
 the two of them swung on the swaying rope all the way down to the escort skiff once there luke steered it over to the prison he helped chewbacca han and lando on board 
 the sail barge continued exploding behind them half of it was now on fire 
 luke guided the skiff around beside the barge where legs couldbe seen sticking straight up out of the sand beside them periscopewas the only part of his anatomy visible above the dune the skiff stopped justabove them and lowered a large electromagnet from its compartment in the with a loud clang the two droids shot out of the sand and locked to plate 
 ow groaned threepio 
 beeedoo dweet artoo agreed 
 in a few minutes they were all in the skiff together more or less in one for the first time they looked at one another and realized they were all in the skifftogether more or less in one piece there was a great long moment of crying and beeping then someone accidentally squeezed arm and he bellowed and then they all ran about securing the the perimeters looking for sailing away 
 the great sail barge settled slowly in a chain of explosions and violent the little skiff flew quietly off across the finally in abrilliant conflagration that was only partially diminished by the scorching afternoonlight of twin suns

 chapter iii 
 
 on returning from the review kutuzov took the austrian general into his private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advanced army prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with the required papers kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out 
 ah said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation in french 
 all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general of whom austria has so many and to lay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us general 
 and kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i even care whether you do or not but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole point 
 the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply in the same tone 
 on the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words on the contrary your participation in the common action is highly valued by his majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence 
 kutuzov bowed with the same smile 
 but that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as general mack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid said kutuzov 
 the general frowned though there was no definite news of an austrian defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat and so suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much like irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so and in fact the last letter he had received from army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable 
 give me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew please have a look at it and kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage in german from the archduke letter 
 we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech also as we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not cross the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line of communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves 
 kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively 
 but you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at the 
 excuse me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to prince andrew look here my dear fellow get from kozlovski all the reports from our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he said handing him several papers make a neat memorandum in french out of all this showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian army and then give it to his excellency 
 prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have liked to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room 
 though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia he had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his face in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive 
 kutuzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindly promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions from vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade prince father 
 your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me 
 on staff among his fellow officers and in the army generally prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two quite opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of him listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrew was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him and considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him 
 coming out of room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the on duty kozlovski who was sitting at the window with a book 
 well prince asked kozlovski 
 i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing 
 and why is it 
 prince andrew shrugged his shoulders 
 any news from mack 
 no 
 if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come 
 probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer door 
 but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door prince andrew stopped short 
 commander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door 
 the commander in chief is engaged said kozlovski going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door whom shall i announce 
 the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who was rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him 
 the commander in chief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmly 
 the face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he took out a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leaf gave it to kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himself into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking why do they look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if he intended to say something but immediately with affected indifference began to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately broke off the door of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger and making long quick strides with his thin legs went up to kutuzov 
 vous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice 
 face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfully closed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closed the door himself behind him 
 the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto been inactive would also soon have to meet the enemy 
 prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost understood all the difficulties of the russian position and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a time he might perhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with the french since suvorov met them he feared that genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced 
 excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridor he met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherkov they were as usual laughing 
 why are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince pale face and glittering eyes 
 nothing to be gay about answered bolkonski 
 just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came toward them from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general who on staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitski aside with his arm said in a breathless voice 
 coming coming stand aside make way please make way 
 the generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress 
 your excellency said he in german stepping forward and addressing the austrian general i have the honor to congratulate you 
 he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson 
 the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening 
 i have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite well only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a beaming smile to his head 
 the general frowned turned away and went on 
 gott wie naiv said he angrily after he had gone a few steps 
 good god what simplicity 
 nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew but bolkonski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and turned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the russian army found vent in anger at untimely jest 
 if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i prevent your doing so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence i will teach you to behave yourself 
 nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at bolkonski silently with eyes 
 the matter i only congratulated them said zherkov 
 i am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkonski and taking arm he left zherkov who did not know what to say 
 come the matter old fellow said nesvitski trying to soothe him 
 the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his excitement you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their business quarante mille hommes massacres et de nos allies detruite et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire he said as if strengthening his views by this french sentence c est bien pour un garcon de rein comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way he added in russian but pronouncing the word with a french accent having noticed that zherkov could still hear him 
 forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed and you find that a cause for jesting 
 it is all very well for that fellow of whom you have made a friend but not for you not for you 
 he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turned and went out of the corridor

 chapter 
 
 yesterday was bright calm and frosty i went to the heights as i proposed my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady and i did not refuse for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request the front door stood open but the jealous gate was fastened as at my last visit i knocked and invoked earnshaw from among the garden beds he unchained it and i entered the fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen i took particular notice of him this time but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages 
 i asked if mr heathcliff were at home he answered no but he would be in at dinner time it was eleven and i announced my intention of going in and waiting for him at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me in the office of watchdog not as a substitute for the host 
 we entered together catherine was there making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal she looked more sulky and less spirited than when i had seen her first she hardly raised her eyes to notice me and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment 
 she does not seem so amiable i thought as mrs dean would persuade me to believe a beauty it is true but not an angel 
 earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen remove them yourself she said pushing them from her as soon as she had done and retiring to a stool by the window where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her lap i approached her pretending to desire a view of the garden and as i fancied adroitly dropped mrs note on to her knee unnoticed by she asked aloud what is that and chucked it off 
 a letter from your old acquaintance the housekeeper at the grange i answered annoyed at her exposing my kind deed and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own she would gladly have gathered it up at this information but hareton beat her he seized and put it in his waistcoat saying mr heathcliff should look at it first thereat catherine silently turned her face from us and very stealthily drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes and her cousin after struggling a while to keep down his softer feelings pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her as ungraciously as he could catherine caught and perused it eagerly then she but a few questions to me concerning the inmates rational and irrational of her former home and gazing towards the hills murmured in soliloquy 
 i should like to be riding minny down there i should like to be climbing up there oh stalled hareton and she leant her pretty head back against the sill with half a yawn and half a sigh and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her 
 mrs heathcliff i said after sitting some time mute you are not aware that i am an acquaintance of yours so intimate that i think it strange you come and speak to me my housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you and be greatly disappointed if i return with no news of or from you except that you received her letter and said nothing 
 she appeared to wonder at this speech and asked 
 does ellen like you 
 yes very well i replied unhesitatingly 
 you must tell her she continued that i would answer her letter but l have no materials for writing not even a book from which i might tear a leaf 
 no books i exclaimed how do you contrive to live here without them if l may take the liberty to inquire though provided with a large library frequently very dull at the grange take my books away and i should be desperate 
 i was always reading when i had them said catherine and mr heathcliff never reads so he took it into his head to destroy my books i have not had a glimpse of one for weeks only once i searched through store of theology to his great irritation and once hareton i came upon a secret stock in your latin and greek and some tales and poetry all old friends i brought the last you gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons for the mere love of stealing they are of no use to you or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall perhaps your envy counselled mr heathcliff to rob me of my treasures but most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart and you cannot deprive me of those 
 earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations 
 mr hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge i said coming to his rescue he is not envious but emulous of your attainments be a clever scholar in a few years 
 and he wants me to sink into a dunce meantime answered catherine yes i hear him trying to spell and read to himself and pretty blunders he makes i wish you would repeat chevy chase as you did yesterday it was extremely funny i heard you and i heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words and then cursing because you read their explanations 
 the young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance and then laughed at for trying to remove it i had a similar notion and remembering mrs anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared i observed 
 but mrs heathcliff we have each had a commencement and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us we should stumble and totter yet 
 oh she replied i wish to limit his acquirements still he has no right to appropriate what is mine and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations those books both prose and verse were consecrated to me by other associations and i hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth besides of all he has selected my favourite pieces that i love the most to repeat as if out of deliberate malice 
 chest heaved in silence a minute he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath which it was no easy task to suppress i rose and from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment took up my station in the doorway surveying the external prospect as i stood he followed my example and left the room but presently reappeared bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands which he threw into lap exclaiming 
 take them i never want to hear or read or think of them again 
 i have them now she answered i shall connect them with you and hate them 
 she opened one that had obviously been often turned over and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner then laughed and threw it from her and listen she continued provokingly commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion 
 but his would endure no further torment i heard and not altogether disapprovingly a manual check given to her saucy tongue the little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin s sensitive though uncultivated feelings and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflicter he afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire i read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen i fancied that as they consumed he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted and the triumph and pleasure he had anticipated from them and i fancied i guessed the incitement to his secret studies also he had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments till catherine crossed his path shame at her scorn and hope of her approval were his first prompters to higher pursuits and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other his endeavours to rise himself had produced just the contrary result 
 yes all the good that such a brute as you can get from them cried catherine sucking her damaged lip and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes 
 better hold your tongue now he answered fiercely 
 and his agitation precluding further speech he advanced hastily to the entrance where i made way for him to pass but ere he had crossed the doorstones mr heathcliff coming up the causeway encountered him and laying hold of his shoulder asked 
 to do now my lad 
 naught naught he said and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude 
 heathcliff gazed after him and sighed 
 it will be odd if i thwart myself he muttered unconscious that i was behind him but when i look for his father in his face i find her every day more how the devil is he so like i can hardly bear to see him 
 he bent his eyes to the ground and walked moodily in there was a restless anxious expression in his countenance i had never remarked there before and he looked sparer in person his on perceiving him through the window immediately escaped to the kitchen so that i remained alone 
 glad to see you out of doors again mr lockwood he said in reply to my greeting from selfish motives partly i think i could readily supply your loss in this desolation wondered more than once what brought you here 
 an idle whim i fear sir was my answer or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away i shall set out for london next week and i must give you warning that i feel no disposition to retain thrushcross grange beyond the twelve months i agreed to rent it believe i shall not live there any more 
 oh indeed tired of being banished from the world are you he said but if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you occupy your journey is useless i never relent in exacting my due from anyone 
 coming to plead off nothing about it i exclaimed considerably irritated should you wish it settle with you now and i drew my notebook from my pocket 
 no no he replied coolly leave sufficient behind to cover your debts if you fail to return not in such a hurry sit down and take your dinner with us a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome catherine bring the things in where are you 
 catherine reappeared bearing a tray of knives and forks 
 you may get your dinner with joseph muttered heathcliff aside and remain in the kitchen till he is gone 
 she obeyed his directions very punctually perhaps she had no temptation to transgress living among clowns and misanthropists she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them 
 with mr heathcliff grim and saturnine on the one hand and hareton absolutely dumb on the other i made a somewhat cheerless meal and bid adieu early i would have departed by the back way to get a last glimpse of catherine and annoy old joseph but hareton received orders to lead up my horse and my host himself escorted me to the door so i could not fulfil my wish 
 how dreary life gets over in that house l reflected while riding down the road what a realization of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for mrs linton heathcliff had she and i struck up an attachment as her good nurse desired and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town

 london 
 dearest people 
 here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel piccadilly not a fashionable place but uncle stopped here years ago and go anywhere else however we mean to stay long so no great matter oh i begin to tell you how i enjoy it all i never can so only give you bits out of my notebook for done nothing but sketch and scribble since i started 
 i sent a line from halifax when i felt pretty miserable but after that i got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me everyone was very kind to me especially the officers laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death afraid 
 aunt and flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when i had done what i could for them i went and enjoyed myself such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves it was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good as for jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the speaking trumpet have been in such a state of rapture 
 it was all heavenly but i was glad to see the irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks it was early in the morning but i regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead i never shall forget it 
 at queenstown on of my new acquaintances left us mr lennox and when i said something about the lakes of killarney he sighed and and with a look at me 
 oh have you heard of kate kearney 
 she lives on the banks of killarney 
 from the glance of her eye 
 shun danger and fly 
 for the glance of kate kearney 
 that nonsensical 
 we only stopped at liverpool a few hours a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved a la mutton chop the first thing then he flattered himself that he looked like a true briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an american stood in them and said with a grin there yer har sir given em the latest yankee shine it amused uncle immensely oh i must tell you what that absurd lennox did he got his friend ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing i saw in my room was a lovely one with robert compliments on the card that fun girls i like traveling 
 i never shall get to london if i hurry the trip was like riding through a long picture gallery full of lovely landscapes the farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies such perfect color i never saw the grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so dark i was in a rapture all the way so was flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour aunt was tired and went to sleep but uncle read his guidebook and be astonished at anything this is the way we went on amy flying that must be kenilworth that gray place among the trees flo darting to my sweet we must go there sometime we papa uncle calmly admiring his my dear not unless you want beer a brewery 
 a flo cried out bless me a gallows and a man going up where where shrieks amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains a colliery remarks uncle with a twinkle of the eye a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says amy see papa they pretty added flo sentimentally geese young ladies returns uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till flo settles down to enjoy the flirtations of captain cavendish and i have the scenery all to myself 
 of course it rained when we got to london and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas we rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i half ready a white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw shopping in regent street is perfectly splendid things seem so cheap nice ribbons only sixpence a yard i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris that sound sort of elegant and rich 
 flo and i for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while aunt and uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone it was so droll for when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and i get at him he hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace at last in my despair i saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said 
 now then mum 
 i gave my order as soberly as i could and slamming down the door with an aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral i poked again and said a little faster then off he went as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate 
 today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look the duke of devonshire lives near i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of house is not far off such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them 
 rotten row means route de roi or the way but now more like a riding school than anything else the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which according to our rules i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy ark everyone men stout ladies little children and the young folks do a deal of flirting here i say a pair exchange rose buds for the thing to wear one in the and i thought it rather a nice little idea 
 in the to westminster abbey but expect me to describe it impossible so only say it was sublime this evening we are going to see fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life 
 very late but i let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening who do you think came in as we were at tea english friends fred and frank vaughn i was so surprised for i have known them but for the cards both are tall fellows with whiskers fred handsome in the english style and frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle go so we shall return the call and see them as we can they went to the theater with us and we did have such a good time for frank devoted himself to flo and fred and i talked over past present and future fun as if we had know each other all our days tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health fred laughed when i spoke of jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there what ages ago it seems it 
 aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so i must stop i really feel like a dissipated london fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theaters new gowns and gallant creatures who say ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true english lordliness i long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving 
 amy 
 
 
 paris 
 dear girls 
 in my last i told you about our london visit how kind the vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything else for at hampton i saw cartoons and at the museum rooms full of pictures by turner lawrence reynolds hogarth and the other great creatures the day in richmond park was charming for we had a regular english picnic and i had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than i could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up we did london to our content thanks to fred and frank and were sorry to go away for though english people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality i think the vaughns hope to meet us in rome next winter and i shall be dreadfully disappointed if they for grace and i are great friends and the boys very nice fellows especially fred 
 well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she say a word and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i know what we should do without him uncle know ten words and insists on talking english very loud as if it would make people understand him pronunciation is and flo and i though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we and are very grateful to have fred do the parley vooing as uncle calls it 
 such delightful times as we are having from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures rainy days i spend in the louvre revelling in pictures jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but i have and cultivation eye and taste as fast as i can she would like the relics of great people better for seen her cocked hat and gray coat his cradle and his old toothbrush also marie little shoe the ring of saint denis sword and many other interesting things talk for hours about them when i come but time to write 
 the palais royale is a heavenly place so full of bijouterie and lovely things that nearly distracted because i buy them fred wanted to get me some but of course i allow it then the bois and champs elysees are tres magnifique seen the imperial family several times the emperor an ugly man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste i dress green hat and yellow gloves little nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kissed his hand to the people as he passes in his barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind 
 we often walk in the tuileries gardens for they are lovely though the antique luxembourg gardens suit me better pere la chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament that is so frenchy 
 our rooms are on the rue de rivoli and sitting on the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street it is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our work to go out fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man i ever knew except laurie whose manners are more charming i wish fred was dark for i fancy light men however the vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so i find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower 
 next week we are off to germany and switzerland and as we shall travel fast i shall only be able to give you hasty letters i keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that i see and admire as father advised it is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles 
 adieu i embrace you tenderly 
 
 votre amie 
 
 heidelberg 
 
 my dear mamma 
 having a quiet hour before we leave for berne try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see 
 the sail up the rhine was perfect and i just sat and enjoyed it with all my might get old guidebooks and read about it i words beautiful enough to describe it at coblenz we had a lovely time for some students from bonn with whom fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade it was a moonlight night and about one flo and i were waked by the most delicious music under our windows we flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us fred and the students singing away down below it was the most romantic thing i ever river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone 
 when they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing away to smoke and drink beer i suppose next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket and looked very sentimental i laughed at him and said i throw it but flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again afraid going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it 
 the baths at nassau were very gay so was where fred lost some money and i scolded him he needs someone to look after him when frank is not with him kate said once she hoped marry soon and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him frankfurt was delightful i saw house statue and famous ariadne it was very lovely but i should have enjoyed it more if i had known the story better i like to ask as everyone knew it or pretended they did i wish jo would tell me all about it i ought to have read more for i find i know anything and it mortifies me

 london 
 dearest people 
 here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel piccadilly not a fashionable place but uncle stopped here years ago and go anywhere else however we mean to stay long so no great matter oh i begin to tell you how i enjoy it all i never can so only give you bits out of my notebook for done nothing but sketch and scribble since i started 
 i sent a line from halifax when i felt pretty miserable but after that i got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me everyone was very kind to me especially the officers laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death afraid 
 aunt and flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when i had done what i could for them i went and enjoyed myself such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves it was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good as for jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the speaking trumpet have been in such a state of rapture 
 it was all heavenly but i was glad to see the irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks it was early in the morning but i regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead i never shall forget it 
 at queenstown on of my new acquaintances left us mr lennox and when i said something about the lakes of killarney he sighed and and with a look at me 
 oh have you heard of kate kearney 
 she lives on the banks of killarney 
 from the glance of her eye 
 shun danger and fly 
 for the glance of kate kearney 
 that nonsensical 
 we only stopped at liverpool a few hours a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved a la mutton chop the first thing then he flattered himself that he looked like a true briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an american stood in them and said with a grin there yer har sir given em the latest yankee shine it amused uncle immensely oh i must tell you what that absurd lennox did he got his friend ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing i saw in my room was a lovely one with robert compliments on the card that fun girls i like traveling 
 i never shall get to london if i hurry the trip was like riding through a long picture gallery full of lovely landscapes the farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies such perfect color i never saw the grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so dark i was in a rapture all the way so was flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour aunt was tired and went to sleep but uncle read his guidebook and be astonished at anything this is the way we went on amy flying that must be kenilworth that gray place among the trees flo darting to my sweet we must go there sometime we papa uncle calmly admiring his my dear not unless you want beer a brewery 
 a flo cried out bless me a gallows and a man going up where where shrieks amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains a colliery remarks uncle with a twinkle of the eye a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says amy see papa they pretty added flo sentimentally geese young ladies returns uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till flo settles down to enjoy the flirtations of captain cavendish and i have the scenery all to myself 
 of course it rained when we got to london and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas we rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i half ready a white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw shopping in regent street is perfectly splendid things seem so cheap nice ribbons only sixpence a yard i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris that sound sort of elegant and rich 
 flo and i for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while aunt and uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone it was so droll for when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and i get at him he hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace at last in my despair i saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said 
 now then mum 
 i gave my order as soberly as i could and slamming down the door with an aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral i poked again and said a little faster then off he went as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate 
 today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look the duke of devonshire lives near i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of house is not far off such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them 
 rotten row means route de roi or the way but now more like a riding school than anything else the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which according to our rules i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy ark everyone men stout ladies little children and the young folks do a deal of flirting here i say a pair exchange rose buds for the thing to wear one in the and i thought it rather a nice little idea 
 in the to westminster abbey but expect me to describe it impossible so only say it was sublime this evening we are going to see fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life 
 very late but i let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening who do you think came in as we were at tea english friends fred and frank vaughn i was so surprised for i have known them but for the cards both are tall fellows with whiskers fred handsome in the english style and frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle go so we shall return the call and see them as we can they went to the theater with us and we did have such a good time for frank devoted himself to flo and fred and i talked over past present and future fun as if we had know each other all our days tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health fred laughed when i spoke of jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there what ages ago it seems it 
 aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so i must stop i really feel like a dissipated london fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theaters new gowns and gallant creatures who say ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true english lordliness i long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving 
 amy 
 
 
 paris 
 dear girls 
 in my last i told you about our london visit how kind the vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything else for at hampton i saw cartoons and at the museum rooms full of pictures by turner lawrence reynolds hogarth and the other great creatures the day in richmond park was charming for we had a regular english picnic and i had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than i could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up we did london to our content thanks to fred and frank and were sorry to go away for though english people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality i think the vaughns hope to meet us in rome next winter and i shall be dreadfully disappointed if they for grace and i are great friends and the boys very nice fellows especially fred 
 well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she say a word and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i know what we should do without him uncle know ten words and insists on talking english very loud as if it would make people understand him pronunciation is and flo and i though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we and are very grateful to have fred do the parley vooing as uncle calls it 
 such delightful times as we are having from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures rainy days i spend in the louvre revelling in pictures jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but i have and cultivation eye and taste as fast as i can she would like the relics of great people better for seen her cocked hat and gray coat his cradle and his old toothbrush also marie little shoe the ring of saint denis sword and many other interesting things talk for hours about them when i come but time to write 
 the palais royale is a heavenly place so full of bijouterie and lovely things that nearly distracted because i buy them fred wanted to get me some but of course i allow it then the bois and champs elysees are tres magnifique seen the imperial family several times the emperor an ugly man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste i dress green hat and yellow gloves little nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kissed his hand to the people as he passes in his barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind 
 we often walk in the tuileries gardens for they are lovely though the antique luxembourg gardens suit me better pere la chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament that is so frenchy 
 our rooms are on the rue de rivoli and sitting on the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street it is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our work to go out fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man i ever knew except laurie whose manners are more charming i wish fred was dark for i fancy light men however the vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so i find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower 
 next week we are off to germany and switzerland and as we shall travel fast i shall only be able to give you hasty letters i keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that i see and admire as father advised it is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles 
 adieu i embrace you tenderly 
 
 votre amie 
 
 heidelberg 
 
 my dear mamma 
 having a quiet hour before we leave for berne try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see 
 the sail up the rhine was perfect and i just sat and enjoyed it with all my might get old guidebooks and read about it i words beautiful enough to describe it at coblenz we had a lovely time for some students from bonn with whom fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade it was a moonlight night and about one flo and i were waked by the most delicious music under our windows we flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us fred and the students singing away down below it was the most romantic thing i ever river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone 
 when they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing away to smoke and drink beer i suppose next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket and looked very sentimental i laughed at him and said i throw it but flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again afraid going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it

lionfish nov chapter the third taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dumbledore reckons getting stronger again as well ron whispered 
 
 everything harry had seen in the pensieve nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward he had now shared with ron and hermione and of course with sirius to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left office harry ron and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night talking it all over until mind was reeling until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off 
 
 ron stared into the common room fire harry thought he saw ron shiver slightly even though the evening was warm 
 
 and he trusts snape ron said he really trusts snape even though he knows he was a death eater 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 hermione had not spoken for ten minutes she was sitting with her forehead in her hands staring at her knees harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a pensieve 
 
 rita skeeter she muttered finally 
 
 how can you be worrying about her now said ron in utter disbelief 
 
 not worrying about her hermione said to her knees just thinkingremember what she said to me in the three broomsticks i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl this is what she meant it she reported his trial she knew passed information to the death eaters and winky too a bad wizard mr crouch would have been furious he got off he would have talked about it at home 
 
 yeah but bagman pass information on purpose did he 
 
 hermione shrugged 
 
 and fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch ron said turning back to harry 
 
 yeah said harry but only saying that because crouch disappeared near the beauxbatons carriage 
 
 we never thought of her did we said ron slowly mind you definitely got giant blood and she want to admit it 
 
 of course she said hermione sharply looking up look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother look at fudge jumping to conclusions about her just because part giant who needs that sort of prejudice probably say i had big bones if i knew what get for telling the truth 
 
 hermione looked at her watch we done any practicing she said looking shocked we were going to do the impediment curse have to really get down to it tomorrow come on harry you need to get some sleep 
 
 harry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory as harry pulled on his pajamas he looked over at bed true to his word to dumbledore he had not told ron and hermione about parents as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan but as he listened to snores he thought that neville deserved it more than he did lying in the darkness harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr and mrs remembered the jeers of the crowd as son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the understood how they had he remembered the face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later 
 
 it was voldemort harry thought staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness it all came back to was the one who had torn these families apart who had ruined all these lives 
 
 ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams which would finish on the day of the third task but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry prepare 
 
 worry about it hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he mind practicing on his own for a while at least get top marks in defense against the dark arts never have found out about all these hexes in class 
 
 good training for when all aurors said ron excitedly attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair 
 
 the mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again everyone was looking forward to the third task which would take place a week before the end of term harry was practicing hexes at every available moment he felt more confident about this task than either of the others difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be moody was right harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now and this time he had some notice some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead 
 
 tired of walking in on harry hermione and ron all over the school professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes harry had soon mastered the impediment curse a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers the reductor curse which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way and the spell a useful discovery of that would make his wand point due north therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze he was still having trouble with the shield charm though this was supposed to cast a temporary invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses hermione managed to shatter it with a jinx and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the 
 
 still doing really well though hermione said encouragingly looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned some of these are bound to come in handy 
 
 come and look at this said ron who was standing by the window he was staring down onto the grounds malfoy doing 
 
 harry and hermione went to see malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout both were smirking malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it 
 
 he looks like using a said harry curiously 
 
 he be said hermione told you those sorts of things work around hogwarts come on harry she added briskly turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room try that shield charm again 
 
 sirius was sending daily owls now like hermione he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not responsibility nor was it within his power to influence it 
 
 if voldemort is really getting stronger again he wrote my priority is to ensure your safety he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under protection but all the same take no risks concentrate on getting through that maze safely and then we can turn our attention to other matters 
 nerves mounted as june the drew closer but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks for one thing he was confident that this time he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task for another this was the final hurdle and however well or badly he did the tournament would at last be over which would be an enormous relief 
 
 
 
 breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task the post owls appeared bringing harry a card from sirius it was only a piece of parchment folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front but harry appreciated it all the same a screech owl arrived for hermione carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual she unfolded the paper glanced at the front page and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it 
 
 what said harry and ron together staring at her nothing said hermione quickly trying to shove the paper out of sight but ron grabbed it he stared at the headline and said no way not today that old cow 
 
 what said harry rita skeeter again 
 
 no said ron and just like hermione he attempted to push the paper out of sight 
 
 about me it said harry 
 
 no said ron in an entirely unconvincing tone but before harry could demand to see the paper draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table 
 
 hey potter potter your head you feeling all right sure not going to go berserk on us 
 
 malfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too slytherins up and down the table were sniggering twisting in their seats to see reaction 
 
 let me see it harry said to ron give it here 
 
 very reluctantly ron handed over the newspaper harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture beneath the banner headline 
 
 harry potter 
 disturbed and dangerous 
 the boy who defeated is unstable and possibly dangerous writes rita skeeter special correspondent alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry strange behavior which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament or even to attend hogwarts school 
 potter the daily prophet can exclusively reveal regularly collapses at school and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead relic of the curse with which attempted to kill him on monday last midway through a divination lesson your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying 
 it is possible say top experts at st hospital for magical maladies and injuries that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his confusion 
 he might even be pretending said one specialist this could be a plea for attention 
 the daily prophet however has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts has carefully concealed from the wizarding public 
 potter can speak parseltongue reveals draco malfoy a hogwarts fourth year there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy it was all hushed up though but made friends with werewolves and giants too we think do anything for a bit of power 
 parseltongue the ability to converse with snakes has long been considered a dark art indeed the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than himself a member of the dark force defense league who wished to remain unnamed stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue as worthy of investigation personally i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic and are historically associated with evildoers similarly anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence 
 albus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard tournament some fear that potter might resort to the dark arts in his desperation to win the tournament the third task of which takes place this evening 
 gone off me a bit she said harry lightly folding up the paper 
 
 over at the slytherin table malfoy crabbe and goyle were laughing at him tapping their heads with their fingers pulling grotesquely mad faces and waggling their tongues like snakes 
 
 how did she know your scar hurt in divination ron said no way she was there no way she heard 
 
 the window was open said harry i opened it to breathe 
 
 you were at the top of north tower hermione said your voice have carried all the way down to the grounds 
 
 well the one supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging said harry you tell me how she did it 
 
 been trying said hermione but ibut 
 
 an odd dreamy expression suddenly came over face she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair 
 
 are you all right said ron frowning at her 
 
 yes said hermione breathlessly she ran her fingers through her hair again and then held her hand up to her mouth as though speaking into an invisible harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 had an idea hermione said gazing into space i think i knowbecause then no one would be able to seeeven moodyand have been able to get onto the window ledgebut not definitely not allowedi think got her just give me two seconds in the library just to make sure 
 
 with that hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the great hall 
 
 oi ron called after her got our history of magic exam in ten minutes blimey he said turning back to harry she must really hate that skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam you going to do in class read again 
 
 exempt from the tests as a triwizard champion harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far looking up fresh hexes for the third task 
 
 so harry said to ron but just then professor mcgonagall came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him 
 
 potter the champions are congregating in the chamber off the hall after breakfast she said 
 
 but the not till tonight said harry accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front afraid he had mistaken the time 
 
 aware of that potter she said the champions families are invited to watch the final task you know this is simply a chance for you to greet them 
 
 she moved away harry gaped after her 
 
 she expect the dursleys to turn up does she he asked ron blankly 
 
 dunno said ron harry better hurry going to be late for binns see you later 
 
 harry finished his breakfast in the emptying great hall he saw fleur delacour get up from the ravenclaw table and join cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward harry stayed where he was he really want to go into the chamber he had no family no family who would turn up to see him risk his life anyway but just as he was getting up thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research the door of the side chamber opened and cedric stuck his head out 
 
 harry come on waiting for you 
 
 utterly perplexed harry got up the dursleys possibly be here could they he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chamber 
 
 cedric and his parents were just inside the door viktor krum was over in a corner conversing with his mother and father in rapid bulgarian he had inherited his fathers hooked nose on the other side of the room fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother little sister gabrielle was holding her hand she waved at harry who waved back grinning then he saw mrs weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace beaming at him 
 
 surprise mrs weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them thought come and watch you harry she bent down and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 you all right said bill grinning at harry and shaking his hand charlie wanted to come but he get time off he said you were incredible against the horntail 
 
 fleur delacour harry noticed was eyeing bill with great interest over her shoulder harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them 
 
 this is really nice of you harry muttered to mrs weasley i thought for a moment the dursleys 
 
 hmm said mrs weasley pursing her lips she had always refrained from criticizing the dursleys in front of harry but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned 
 
 great being back here said bill looking around the chamber violet the fat friend winked at him from her frame seen this place for five years is that picture of the mad knight still around sir cadogan 
 
 oh yeah said harry who had met sir cadogan the previous year 
 
 and the fat lady said bill 
 
 she was here in my time said mrs weasley she gave me such a telling off one night when i got back to the dormitory at four in the morning 
 
 what were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning said bill surveying his mother with amazement 
 
 mrs weasley grinned her eyes twinkling 
 
 your father and i had been for a nighttime stroll she said he got caught by apollyon pringle he was the caretaker in those days your still got the marks 
 
 fancy giving us a tour harry said bill 
 
 yeah okay said harry and they made their way back toward the door into the great hall as they passed amos diggory he looked around 
 
 there you are are you he said looking harry up and down 
 
 bet not feeling quite as full of yourself now caught you up on points are you 
 
 what said harry 
 
 ignore him said cedric in a low voice to harry frowning after his father been angry ever since rita article about the triwizard tournament you know when she made out you were the only hogwarts champion 
 
 bother to correct her though did he said amos diggory loudly enough for harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with mrs weasley and bill show him ced beaten him once before you 
 
 rita skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble amos mrs weasley said angrily i would have thought know that working at the ministry 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry but his wife laid a hand on his arm and he merely shrugged and turned away 
 
 harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with bill and mrs weasley showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship mrs weasley was intrigued by the whomping willow which had been planted after she had left school and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before hagrid a man called ogg 
 
 percy harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses 
 
 not good said bill 
 
 very upset said mrs weasley lowering her voice and glancing around the ministry wants to keep mr disappearance quiet but been hauled in for questioning about the instructions mr crouch has been sending in they seem to think a chance they genuinely written by him been under a lot of strain not letting him fill in for mr crouch as the fifth judge tonight cornelius fudge is going to be doing it 
 
 they returned to the castle for lunch 
 
 mum bill said ron looking stunned as he joined the gryffindor table you doing here 
 
 come to watch harry in the last task said mrs weasley brightly i must say it makes a lovely change not having to cook how was your exam 
 
 ohokay said ron remember all the goblin rebels names so i invented a few all right he said helping himself to a cornish pasty while mrs weasley looked stern all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it hard 
 
 fred george and ginny came to sit next to them too and harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the burrow he had forgotten to worry about that task and not until hermione turned up halfway through lunch did he remember that she had had a brainwave about rita skeeter 
 
 are you going to tell us 
 
 hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at mrs weasley 
 
 hello hermione said mrs weasley much more stiffly than usual 
 
 hello said hermione her smile faltering at the cold expression on mrs face 
 
 harry looked between them then said mrs weasley you believe that rubbish rita skeeter wrote in witch weekly did you because not my girlfriend 
 
 oh said mrs weasley no of course i 
 
 but she became considerably warmer toward hermione after that 
 
 harry bill and mrs weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now bagman looked quite cheerful but cornelius fudge who was sitting next to madame maxime looked stern and was not talking madame maxime was concentrating on her plate and harry thought her eyes looked red hagrid kept glancing along the table at her 
 
 there were more courses than usual but harry who was starting to feel really nervous now eat much as the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table and silence fell 
 
 ladies and gentlemen in five minutes time i will be asking you to make your way down to the quidditch field for the third and final task of the triwizard tournament will the champions please follow mr bagman down to the stadium now 
 
 harry got up the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric fleur and viktor 
 
 feeling all right harry bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds confident 
 
 okay said harry it was sort of true he was nervous but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better 
 
 they walked onto the quidditch field which was now completely unrecognizable a hedge ran all the way around the edge of it there was a gap right in front of them the entrance to the vast maze the passage beyond it looked dark and creepy 
 
 five minutes later the stands had begun to fill the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats the sky was a deep clear blue now and the first stars were starting to appear hagrid professor moody professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached bagman and the champions they were wearing large red luminous stars on their hats all except hagrid who had his on the back of his moleskin vest 
 
 we are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze said professor mcgonagall to the champions if you get into difficulty and wish to be rescued send red sparks into the air and one of us will come and get you do you understand 
 
 the champions nodded 
 
 off you go then said bagman brightly to the four patrollers 
 
 good luck harry hagrid whispered and the four of them walked away in different directions to station themselves around the maze bagman now pointed his wand at his throat muttered sonorus and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemen the third and final task of the triwizard tournament is about to begin let me remind you how the points currently stand tied in first place with points each mr cedric diggory and mr harry potter both of hogwarts school the cheers and applause sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into the darkening sky in second place with eighty points mr viktor krum of durmstrang institute more applause and in third place miss fleur delacour of beauxbatons academy 
 
 harry could just make out mrs weasley bill ron and hermione applauding fleur politely halfway up the stands he waved up at them and they waved back beaming at him 
 
 soon my whistle harry and cedric said bagman three two one 
 
 he gave a short blast on his whistle and harry and cedric hurried forward into the maze 
 
 the towering hedges cast black shadows across the path and whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze harry felt almost as though he were underwater again he pulled out his wand muttered lumos and heard cedric do the same just behind him 
 
 after about fifty yards they reached a fork they looked at each other 
 
 see you harry said and he took the left one while cedric took the right 
 
 harry heard whistle for the second time krum had entered the maze harry sped up his chosen path seemed completely deserted he turned right and hurried on holding his wand high over his head trying to see as far ahead as possible still there was nothing in sight 
 
 whistle blew in the distance for the third time all of the champions were now inside 
 
 harry kept looking behind him the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy he reached a second fork 
 
 point me he whispered to his wand holding it flat in his palm 
 
 the wand spun around once and pointed toward his right into solid hedge that way was north and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze the best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible 
 
 the path ahead was empty too and when harry reached a right turn and took it he again found his way unblocked harry know why but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him surely he should have met something by now it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security then he heard movement right behind him he held out his wand ready to attack but its beam fell only upon cedric who had just hurried out of a path on the side cedric looked severely shaken the sleeve of his robe was smoking 
 
 skrewts he hissed enormous i only just got away 
 
 he shook his head and dived out of sight along another path keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts harry hurried off again then as he turned a corner he sawa dementor gliding toward him twelve feet tall its face hidden by its hood its rotting scabbed hands outstretched it advanced sensing its way blindly toward him harry could hear its rattling breath he felt clammy coldness stealing over him but knew what he had to do 
 
 he summoned the happiest thought he could concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and hermione raised his wand and cried expecto patronum 
 
 a silver stag erupted from the end of wand and galloped toward the dementor which fell back and tripped over the hem of its had never seen a dementor stumble 
 
 hang on he shouted advancing in the wake of his silver patronus a boggart riddikulus 
 
 there was a loud crack and the exploded in a wisp of smoke the silver stag faded from sight harry wished it could have stayed he could have used some companybut he moved on quickly and quietly as possible listening hard his wand held high once more 
 
 leftrightleft againtwice he found himself facing dead ends he did the spell again and found that he was going too far east he turned back took a right turn and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him 
 
 harry approached it cautiously pointing the beam at it this looked like some kind of enchantment he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way 
 
 reducio he said 
 
 the spell shot straight through the mist leaving it intact he supposed he should have known better the reductor curse was for solid objects what would happen if he walked through the mist was it worth chancing it or should he double back 
 
 he was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence 
 
 fleur harry yelled 
 
 there was silence he stared all around him what had happened to her her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead he took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist 
 
 the world turned upside down harry was hanging from the ground with his hair on end his glasses dangling off his nose threatening to fall into the bottomless sky he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there terrified it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass which had now become the ceiling below him the dark heavens stretched endlessly he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet he would fall away from the earth completely 
 
 think he told himself as all the blood rushed to his head think 
 
 but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky did he dare move his foot he could hear the blood pounding in his ears he had two choices try and move or send up red sparks and get rescued and disqualified from the task 
 
 he shut his eyes so he be able to see the view of endless space below him and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling 
 
 immediately the world righted itself harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground he felt temporarily limp with shock he took a deep steadying breath then got up again and hurried forward looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight 
 
 he paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of fleur he was sure it had been she who had screamed what had she met was she all right there was no sign of red sparks did that mean she had got herself out of trouble or was she in such trouble that she reach her wand harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing uneasebut at the same time he help thinking one champion down 
 
 the cup was somewhere close by and it sounded as though fleur was no longer in the running got this far he what if he actually managed to win fleetingly and for the first time since found himself champion he saw again that image of himself raising the triwizard cup in front of the rest of the school 
 
 he met nothing for ten minutes but kept running into dead ends twice he took the same wrong turning finally he found a new route and started to jog along it his wandlight waving making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a skrewt 
 
 cedric was right it was enormous ten feet long it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything its long sting was curled over its back its thick armor glinted in the light from wand which he pointed at it 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the spell hit the armor and rebounded harry ducked just in time but could smell burning hair it had singed the top of his head the skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him 
 
 impedimenta harry yelled the spell hit the armor again and ricocheted off harry staggered back a few paces and fell over impedimenta 
 
 the skrewt was inches from him when it froze he had managed to hit it on its fleshy underside panting harry pushed himself away from it and ran hard in the opposite direction the impediment curse was not permanent the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment 
 
 he took a left path and hit a dead end a right and hit another forcing himself to stop heart hammering he performed the spell again backtracked and chose a path that would take him northwest 
 
 he had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead 
 
 what are you doing yelled voice what the hell think doing 
 
 and then harry heard voice 
 
 crucio 
 
 the air was suddenly full of yells horrified harry began sprinting up his path trying to find a way into when none appeared he tried the reductor curse again it very effective but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it tearing his robes and looking to his right saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground krum standing over him 
 
 harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at krum just as krum looked up krum turned and began to run 
 
 stupefy harry yelled 
 
 the spell hit krum in the back he stopped dead in his tracks fell forward and lay motionless facedown in the grass over to cedric who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting his hands over his face 
 
 are you all right harry said roughly grabbing arm 
 
 yeah panted cedric yeahi believe ithe crept up behind heard him i turned around and he had his wand on me 
 
 cedric got up he was still shaking he and harry looked down at krum 
 
 i believe thisi thought he was all right harry said staring at krum 
 
 so did i said cedric 
 
 did you hear fleur scream earlier said harry 
 
 yeah said cedric you think krum got her too 
 
 i know said harry slowly 
 
 should we leave him here cedric muttered 
 
 no said harry i reckon we should send up red sparks come and collect himotherwise probably be eaten by a skrewt 
 
 deserve it cedric muttered but all the same he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air which hovered high above krum marking the spot where he lay 
 
 harry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment looking around them then cedric said welli better go on 
 
 what said harry ohyeahright 
 
 it was an odd moment he and cedric had been briefly united against krum now the fact that they were opponents came back to harry the two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking then harry turned left and cedric right footsteps soon died away 
 
 harry moved on continuing to use the spell making sure he was moving in the right direction it was between him and cedric now his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever but he could hardly believe what just seen krum do the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban that was what moody had told them krum surely have wanted the triwizard cup that sped up 
 
 every so often he hit more dead ends but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze then as he strode down a long straight path he saw movement once again and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature one which he had only seen in picture form in his monster book of monsters 
 
 it was a sphinx it had the body of an lion great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft its head however was that of a woman she turned her long eyes upon harry as he approached he raised his wand hesitating she was not crouching as if to spring but pacing from side to side of the path blocking his progress then she spoke in a deep hoarse voice 
 
 you are very near your goal the quickest way is past me 
 
 soso will you move please said harry knowing what the answer was going to be 
 
 no she said continuing to pace not unless you can answer my riddle answer on your first guess i let you pass answer wrongly i attack remain silent i will let you walk away from me unscathed 
 
 stomach slipped several notches it was hermione who was good at this sort of thing not him he weighed his chances if the riddle was too hard he could keep silent get away from the sphinx unharmed and try and find an alternative route to the center 
 
 okay he said can i hear the riddle 
 
 the sphinx sat down upon her hind legs in the very middle of the path and recited 
 
 first think of the person who lives in disguise 
 who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies 
 next tell me always the last thing to mend 
 the middle of middle and end of the end 
 and finally give me the sound often heard 
 during the search for a word 
 now string them together and answer me this 
 which creature would you be unwilling to kiss 
 
 harry gaped at her 
 
 could i have it againmore slowly he asked tentatively she blinked at him smiled and repeated the poem all the clues add up to a creature i want to kiss harry asked 
 
 she merely smiled her mysterious smile harry took that for a yes harry cast his mind around there were plenty of animals he want to kiss his immediate thought was a skrewt but something told him that the answer have to try and work out the clues 
 
 a person in disguise harry muttered staring at her who be a an impostor no not my guess a a spy come back to thatcould you give me the next clue again please 
 
 she repeated the next lines of the poem 
 
 the last thing to mend harry repeated erno of i have the last bit again 
 
 she gave him the last four lines 
 
 the sound often heard during the search for a word said harry beerhang on er a sound 
 
 the sphinx smiled at him 
 
 spyerspyer said harry pacing up and down a creature i want to kissa spider 
 
 the sphinx smiled more broadly she got up stretched her front legs and then moved aside for him to pass 
 
 thanks said harry and amazed at his own brilliance he dashed forward 
 
 he had to be close now he had to wand was telling him he was bang on course as long as he meet anything too horrible he might have a chance 
 
 harry broke into a run he had a choice of paths up ahead point me he whispered again to his wand and it spun around and pointed him to the one he dashed up this one and saw light ahead 
 
 the triwizard cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him 
 
 cedric was going to get there first cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup and harry knew he would never catch up cedric was much taller had much longer legs 
 
 then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own it was moving so fast cedric was about to run into it and cedric his eyes on the cup had not seen it 
 
 cedric harry bellowed on your left 
 
 cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it but in his haste he tripped harry saw wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon cedric 
 
 stupefy harry yelled the spell hit the gigantic hairy black body but for all the good it did he might as well have thrown a stone at it the spider jerked scuttled around and ran at harry instead 
 
 stupefy impedimenta stupefy 
 
 but it was no use the spider was either so large or so magical that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and pincers before it was upon him 
 
 he was lifted into the air in its front legs struggling madly he tried to kick it his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain he could hear cedric yelling stupefy too but his spell had no more effect than harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmus 
 
 it worked the disarming spell made the spider drop him but that meant that harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg which crumpled beneath him without pausing to think he aimed high at the underbelly as he had done with the skrewt and shouted as cedric yelled the same thing 
 
 the two spells combined did what one alone had not the spider keeled over sideways flattening a nearby hedge and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs 
 
 harry he heard cedric shouting you all right did it fall on you 
 
 no harry called back panting he looked down at his leg it was bleeding freely he could see some sort of thick gluey secretion from the pincers on his torn robes he tried to get up but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight he leaned against the hedge gasping for breath and looked around 
 
 cedric was standing feet from the triwizard cup which was gleaming behind him 
 
 take it then harry panted to cedric go on take it there 
 
 but cedric move he merely stood there looking at harry then he turned to stare at the cup harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light cedric looked around at harry again who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself cedric took a deep breath 
 
 you take it you should win twice saved my neck in here 
 
 not how supposed to work harry said he felt angry his leg was very painful he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider and after all his efforts cedric had beaten him to it just as beaten harry to ask cho to the ball the one who reaches the cup first gets the points you telling you not going to win any races on this leg 
 
 cedric took a few paces nearer to the stunned spider away from the cup shaking his head 
 
 no he said 
 
 stop being noble said harry irritably just take it then we can get out of here 
 
 cedric watched harry steadying himself holding tight to the hedge 
 
 you told me about the dragons cedric said i gone down in the first task if you told me what was coming 
 
 i had help on that too harry snapped trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes you helped me with the egg square 
 
 i had help on the egg in the first place said cedric 
 
 still square said harry testing his leg gingerly it shook violently as he put weight on it he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him 
 
 you got more points on the second task said cedric mulishly you stayed behind to get all the hostages i done that 
 
 i was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously said harry bitterly just take the cup 
 
 no said cedric 
 
 he stepped over the tangled legs to join harry who stared at him cedric was serious he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house had in centuries 
 
 go on cedric said he looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had but his face was set his arms were folded he seemed decided 
 
 harry looked from cedric to the cup for one shining moment he saw himself emerging from the maze holding it he saw himself holding the triwizard cup aloft heard the roar of the crowd saw face shining with admiration more clearly than he had ever seen it beforeand then the picture faded and he found himself staring at shadowy stubborn face 
 
 both of us harry said 
 
 what 
 
 take it at the same time still a hogwarts victory tie for it 
 
 cedric stared at harry he unfolded his arms 
 
 you you sure 
 
 yeah said harry helped each other out we we both got here just take it together 
 
 for a moment cedric looked as though he believe his ears then his face split in a grin 
 
 on he said come here 
 
 he grabbed arm below the shoulder and helped harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood when they had reached it they both held a hand out over one of the gleaming handles 
 
 on three right said harry one two three 
 
 he and cedric both grasped a handle 
 
 instantly harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel his feet had left the ground he could not unclench the hand holding the triwizard cup it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color cedric at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire
