 laws 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue an athenian stranger cleinias acretan megillus a lacedaemonian 
 athenian stranger tell me strangers is a god or some man supposedto be the author of your laws 
 cleinias a god stranger in very truth a god among us cretans heis said to have been zeus but in lacedaemon whence our friend herecomes i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver wouldthey not megillus 
 megillus certainly 
 ath and do you cleinias believe as homer tells that every ninthyear minos went to converse with his olympian sire and was inspiredby him to make laws for your cities 
 cle yes that is our tradition and there was rhadamanthus abrother of his with whose name you are familiar he is reputed tohave been the justest of men and we cretans are of opinion that heearned this reputation from his righteous administration of justicewhen he was alive 
 ath yes and a noble reputation it was worthy of a son of zeus asyou and megillus have been trained in these institutions i dare saythat you will not be unwilling to give an account of your governmentand laws on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and templeof zeus is considerable and doubtless there are shady places underthe lofty trees which will protect us from this scorching no longer young we may often stop to rest beneath them and getover the whole journey without difficulty beguiling the time byconversation 
 cle yes stranger and if we proceed onward we shall come to grovesof cypresses which are of rare height and beauty and there are greenmeadows in which we may repose and converse 
 ath very good 
 cle very good indeed and still better when we see them let usmove on cheerily 
 ath i am first i want to know why the law has ordainedthat you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises and weararms 
 cle i think stranger that the aim of our institutions is easilyintelligible to any one look at the character of our country creteis not like thessaly a large plain and for this reason they havehorsemen in thessaly and we have inequality of the groundin our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot but then if youhave runners you must have light one can carry a heavyweight when running and bows and arrows are convenient because theyare light now all these regulations have been made with a view towar and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in allhis common meals if i am not mistaken wereinstituted by him for a similar reason because he saw that while theyare in the field the citizens are by the nature of the casecompelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutualprotection he seems to me to have thought the world foolish in notunderstanding that all are always at war with one another and if inwar there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularlyappointed under others to protect an army they should be continued inpeace for what men in general term peace would be said by him to beonly a name in reality every city is in a natural state of war withevery other not indeed proclaimed by heralds but everlasting and ifyou look closely you will find that this was the intention of thecretan legislator all institutions private as well as public werearranged by him with a view to war in giving them he was under theimpression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to himwho is defeated in battle for all the good things of the conqueredpass into the hands of the conquerors 
 ath you appear to me stranger to have been thoroughly trainedin the cretan institutions and to be well informed about them willyou tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle ofgovernment which you would lay down you seem to imagine that a wellgoverned state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other statesin war am i right in supposing this to be your meaning 
 cle certainly and our lacedaemonian friend if i am notmistaken will agree with me 
 meg why my good friend how could any lacedaemonian say anythingelse 
 ath and is what you say applicable only to states or also tovillages 
 cle to both alike 
 ath the case is the same 
 cle yes 
 ath and in the village will there be the same war of family againstfamily and of individual against individual 
 cle the same 
 ath and should each man conceive himself to be his shall we say 
 cle o athenian of attica i will not call you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddessherself because you go back to first principles you have thrown alight upon the argument and will now be better able to understandwhat i was just all men are publicly one and each man privately his own 
 ath my good sir what do you mean 
 cle moreover there is a victory and first andbest of victories the lowest and worst of each mangains or sustains at the hands not of another but of himself thisshows that there is a war against ourselves going on within everyone of us 
 ath let us now reverse the order of the argument seeing that everyindividual is either his own superior or his own inferior may wesay that there is the same principle in the house the village andthe state 
 cle you mean that in each of them there is a principle ofsuperiority or inferiority to self 
 ath yes 
 cle you are quite right in asking the question for there certainlyis such a principle and above all in states and the state in whichthe better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferiorclasses may be truly said to be better than itself and may bejustly praised where such a victory is gained or censured in theopposite case 
 ath whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse is aquestion which requires more discussion and may be therefore left forthe present but i now quite understand your meaning when you say thatcitizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities mayunjustly conspire and having the superiority in numbers mayovercome and enslave the few just and when they prevail the statemay be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad and whenthey are defeated its own superior and therefore good 
 cle your remark stranger is a paradox and yet we cannot possiblydeny it 
 ath here is another case for a family there maybe several brothers who are the offspring of a single pair verypossibly the majority of them may be unjust and the just may be ina minority 
 cle very possibly 
 ath and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as towhether this family and household are rightly said to be superior whenthey conquer and inferior when they are conquered for we are not nowconsidering what may or may not be the proper or customary way ofspeaking but we are considering the natural principles of right andwrong in laws 
 cle what you say stranger is most true 
 meg quite excellent in my opinion as far as we have gone 
 ath again might there not be a judge over these brethren ofwhom we were speaking 
 cle certainly 
 ath now which would be the better who destroyed thebad and appointed the good to govern themselves or one who whileallowing the good to govern let the bad live and made themvoluntarily submit or third i suppose in the scale of excellencemight be placed a judge who finding the family distracted notonly did not destroy any one but reconciled them to one another forever after and gave them laws which they mutually observed and wasable to keep them friends 
 cle the last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator 
 ath and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be thereverse of war 
 cle very true 
 ath and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life ofman have in view external war or that kind of intestine war calledcivil which no one if he could prevent would like to have occurringin his own state and when occurring every one would wish to bequit of as soon as possible 
 cle he would have the latter chiefly in view 
 ath and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated bythe destruction of one of the parties and by the victory of theother or that peace and friendship should be andthat being reconciled they should give their attention to foreignenemies 
 cle every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state 
 ath and would not that also be the desire of the legislator 
 cle certainly 
 ath and would not every one always make laws for the sake of thebest 
 cle to be sure 
 ath but war whether external or civil is not the best and theneed of either is to be deprecated but peace with one another andgood will are best nor is the victory of the state over itself to beregarded as a really good thing but as a necessity a man might aswell say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged bymedicine forgetting that there is also a state of the body whichneeds no purge and in like manner no one can be a true he aims at the happiness of the individual or state who looksonly or first of all to external warfare nor will he ever be asound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war and not war forthe sake of peace 
 cle i suppose that there is truth stranger in that remark ofyours and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aimand object of our own institutions and also of the lacedaemonian 
 ath i dare say but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrelwith one another about your legislators instead of gently questioningthem seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest pleasefollow me and the argument first i will put forwardtyrtaeus an athenian by birth but also a spartan citizen who of allmen was most eager about war well he says i sing not i carenot about any man even if he were the richest of men andpossessed every good and then he gives a whole list of them if hebe not at all times a brave warrior i imagine that you too musthave heard his poems our lacedaemonian friend has probably heard morethan enough of them 
 meg very true 
 cle and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete 
 ath come now and let us all join in asking this question oftyrtaeus o most divine poet we will say to him the excellent praisewhich you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficientlyproves that you are wise and good and i and megillus and cleiniasof cnosus do as i believe entirely agree with you but we shouldlike to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men tell do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds ofwar or what would you say a far inferior man to tyrtaeus wouldhave no difficulty in replying quite truly that war is of two kindsone which is universally called civil war and is as we were justnow saying of all wars the worst the other as we should alladmit in which we fall out with other nations who are of adifferent race is a far milder form of warfare 
 cle certainly far milder 
 ath well now when you praise and blame war in this whom are you praising or blaming and to which kind of war areyou referring i suppose that you must mean foreign war if i am tojudge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominatethose 
 who refuse to look upon fields of blood and will not draw nearand strike at their we shall naturally go on to say to tyrtaeus as it those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign he must admit this 
 cle evidently 
 ath they are good but we say that there are still better men whosevirtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles and we too havea poet whom we summon as a witness theognis citizen of megara insicily 
 cyrnus he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight ingold and such an one is far better as we affirm than the other in amore difficult kind of war much in the same degree as justice andtemperance and wisdom when united with courage are better thancourage only for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strifewithout having all virtue but in the war of which tyrtaeus a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die athis post and yet they are generally and almost without exceptioninsolent unjust violent men and the most senseless of human will ask what the conclusion is and what i am seeking to prove imaintain that the divine legislator of crete like any other who isworthy of consideration will always and above all things in makinglaws have regard to the greatest virtue which according to loyalty in the hour of danger and may be truly called perfectjustice whereas that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is wellenough and was praised by the poet at the right time yet in placeand dignity may be said to be only fourth rate 
 cle stranger we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rankwhich is far beneath him 
 ath nay i think that we degrade not him but ourselves if weimagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemonand crete mainly with a view to war 
 cle what ought we to say then 
 ath what truth and what justice require of us if i am notmistaken when speaking in behalf of divine thelegislator when making his laws had in view not a part only andthis the lowest part of virtue but all virtue and that he devisedclasses of laws answering to the kinds of virtue not in the way inwhich modern inventors of laws make the classes for they onlyinvestigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt and one man hasa class of laws about allotments and heiresses another aboutassaults others about ten thousand other such matters but wemaintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as wehave now done and i admired the spirit of your exposition for youwere quite right in beginning with virtue and saying that this wasthe aim of the giver of the law but i thought that you went wrongwhen you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part andthe least part of virtue and this called forth my subsequent you allow me then to explain how i should have liked to haveheard you expound the matter 
 cle by all means 
 ath you ought to have said cretan laws are withreason famous among the hellenes for they fulfil the object oflaws which is to make those who use them happy and they confer everysort of good now goods are of two kinds there are human and thereare divine goods and the human hang upon the divine and the statewhich attains the greater at the same time acquires the less or nothaving the greater has neither of the lesser goods the first ishealth the second beauty the third strength including swiftnessin running and bodily agility generally and the fourth is wealth notthe blind god pluto but one who is keen of sight if only he haswisdom for his companion for wisdom is chief and leader of the divinedass of goods and next follows temperance and from the union ofthese two with courage springs justice and fourth in the scale ofvirtue is courage all these naturally take precedence of the othergoods and this is the order in which the legislator must placethem and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances onthe citizens with a view to these the human looking to the the divine looking to their leader mind some of his ordinanceswill relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with then to the procreation and education of children both male andfemale the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of hiscitizens in youth and age and at every time of life and to givethem punishments and rewards and in reference to all theirintercourse with one another he ought to consider their pains andpleasures and desires and the vehemence of all their passions heshould keep a watch over them and blame and praise them rightly bythe mouth of the laws themselves also with regard to anger andterror and the other perturbations of the soul which arise out ofmisfortune and the deliverances from them which prosperity the experiences which come to men in diseases or in war orpoverty or the opposite of these in all these states he shoulddetermine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition ofeach in the next place the legislator has to be careful how thecitizens make their money and in what way they spend it and to havean eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of voluntary or involuntary he should see how they order allthis and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or iswanting in their several dealings with one another and honour thosewho obey the law and impose fixed penalties on those who the round of civil life is ended and the time has come forthe consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the the lawgiver reviewing his work will appoint guardians to presideover these who walk by intelligence others by trueopinion only and then mind will bind together all his ordinancesand show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice and notwith wealth or ambition this is the spirit stranger in which iwas and am desirous that you should pursue the subject and i wantto know the nature of all these things and how they are arranged inthe laws of zeus as they are termed and in those of the pythianapollo which minos and lycurgus gave and how the order of them isdiscovered to his eyes who has experience in laws gained either bystudy or habit although they are far from being to therest of mankind like ourselves 
 cle how shall we proceed stranger 
 ath i think that we must begin again as before and firstconsider the habit of courage and then we will go on and discussanother and then another form of virtue if you please in this way weshall have a model of the whole and with these and similar discourseswe will beguile the way and when we have gone through all thevirtues we will show by the grace of god that the institutions ofwhich i was speaking look to virtue 
 meg very good and suppose that you first criticize this praiser ofzeus and the laws of crete 
 ath i will try to criticize you and myself as well as him for theargument is a common concern tell not first the syssitia andsecondly the gymnasia invented by your legislator with a view to war 
 meg yes 
 ath and what comes third and what fourth for that i think isthe sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remainingparts of virtue no matter whether you call them parts or what theirname is provided the meaning is clear 
 meg then i or any other lacedaemonian would reply that hunting isthird in order 
 ath let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth 
 meg i think that i can get as far as the fouth head which is thefrequent endurance of pain exhibited among us spartans in fights also in stealing with the prospect of getting agood beating there is too the crypteia or secretservice in which wonderful endurance is people wanderover the whole country by day and by night and even in winter havenot a shoe to their foot and are without beds to lie upon and haveto attend upon themselves marvellous too is the endurance which ourcitizens show in their naked exercises contending against the violentsummer heat and there are many similar practices to speak of whichin detail would be endless 
 ath excellent o lacedaemonian stranger but how ought we to definecourage is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears andpains or also against desires and pleasures and againstflatteries which exercise such a tremendous power that they make thehearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax 
 meg i should say the latter 
 ath in what preceded as you will remember our cnosian friendwas speaking of a man or a city being inferior to younot cleinias 
 cle i was 
 ath now which is in the truest sense inferior the man who isovercome by pleasure or by pain 
 cle i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure for all mendeem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense than the otherwho is overcome by pain 
 ath but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have notlegislated for a courage which is lame of one leg able only to meetattacks which come from the left but impotent against the insidiousflatteries which come from the right 
 cle able to meet both i should say 
 ath then let me once more ask what institutions have you in eitherof your states which give a taste of pleasures and do not avoidthem any more than they avoid pains but which set a person in themidst of them and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward toget the better of them where is an ordinance about pleasure similarto that about pain to be found in your laws tell me what there isof this nature among is there which makes your citizenequally brave against pleasure and pain conquering what they ought toconquer and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous andnearest home 
 meg i was able to tell you stranger many laws which were directedagainst pain but i do not know that i can point out any great orobvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned withpleasure there are some lesser provisions however which i mightmention 
 cle neither can i show anything of that sort which is at allequally prominent in the cretan laws 
 ath no wonder my dear friends and if as is very likely in oursearch after the true and good one of us may have to censure the lawsof the others we must not be offended but take kindly what anothersays 
 cle you are quite right athenian stranger and we will do as yousay 
 ath at our time of life cleinias there should be no feeling ofirritation 
 cle certainly not 
 ath i will not at present determine whether he who censures thecretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong but i believe thati can tell better than either of you what the many say about them forassuming that you have reasonably good laws one of the best of themwill be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of themare right or wrong but with one mouth and one voice they must allagree that the laws are all good for they came from god and anyone who says the contrary is not to be listened to but an old man whoremarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to aruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present 
 cle exactly so stranger and like a diviner although not there atthe time you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of thelegislator and to say what is most true 
 ath as there are no young men present and the legislator has givenold men free licence there will be no impropriety in our discussingthese very matters now that we are alone 
 cle true and therefore you may be as free as you like in yourcensure of our laws for there is no discredit in knowing what iswrong he who receives what is said in a generous and friendlyspirit will be all the better for it 
 ath very good however i am not going to say anything against yourlaws until to the best of my ability i have examined them but i amgoing to raise doubts about them for you are the only people known tous whether greek or barbarian whom the legislator commanded toeschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch in the matter of pains or fears which we have just beendiscussing he thought that they who from infancy had always avoidedpains and fears and sorrows when they were compelled to face themwould run away from those who were hardened in them and wouldbecome their subjects now the legislator ought to have consideredthat this was equally true of pleasure he should have said tohimself that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquaintedwith the greatest pleasures and unused to endure amid the temptationsof pleasure and are not disciplined to refrain from all thingsevil the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fearwould overcome the former class and in another and even a worsemanner they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amidpleasures and have had the opportunity of enjoying them they beingoften the worst of mankind one half of their souls will be a other half free and they will not be worthy to be called in thetrue sense men and freemen tell me whether you assent to my words 
 cle on first hearing what you say appears to be the truth butto be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matterswould be very childish and simple 
 ath suppose cleinias and megillus that we consider the virtuewhich follows next of those which we intended to discuss for aftercourage comes temperance what institutions shall we find relating totemperance either in crete or lacedaemon which like your militaryinstitutions differ from those of any ordinary state 
 meg that is not an easy question to answer still i should say thatthe common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devisedfor the promotion both of temperance and courage 
 ath there seems to be a difficulty stranger with regard tostates in making words and facts coincide so that there can be nodispute about them as in the human body the regimen which doesgood in one way does harm in another and we can hardly say that anyone course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution nowthe gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good and yet theyare a source of evil in civil troubles as is shown in the case of themilesian and boeotian and thurian youth among whom theseinstitutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancientand natural custom of love below the level not only of man but ofthe beasts the charge may be fairly brought against your cities aboveall others and is true also of most other states which especiallycultivate gymnastics whether such matters are to be regardedjestingly or seriously i think that the pleasure is to be deemednatural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women butthat the intercourse of men with men or of women with women iscontrary to nature and that the bold attempt was originally due tounbridled lust the cretans are always accused of having inventedthe story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted to justifythemselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practiceof the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver leavingthe story we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almostentirely on pleasure and pain both in states and in are two fountains which nature lets flow and he who drawsfrom them where and when and as much as he ought is happy andthis holds of men and individuals as well as states and hewho indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time is thereverse of happy 
 meg i admit stranger that your words are well spoken and ihardly know what to say in answer to you but still i think that thespartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure of the cretanlaws i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend but the lawsof sparta in as far as they relate to pleasure appear to me to bethe best in the world for that which leads mankind in general intothe wildest pleasure and licence and every other folly the law hasclean driven out and neither in the country nor in towns which areunder the control of sparta will you find revelries and the manyincitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them and anyone who meets a drunken and disorderly person will immediately havehim most severely punished and will not let him off on anypretence not even at the time of a dionysiac festival although ihave remarked that this may happen at your performances on the they are called and among our tarentine colonists i have seenthe whole city drunk at a dionysiac festival but nothing of thesort happens among us 
 ath o lacedaemonian stranger these festivities are praiseworthywhere there is a spirit of endurance but are very senseless when theyare under no regulations in order to retaliate an athenian hasonly to point out the licence which exists among your women to allsuch accusations whether they are brought against the us or you there is one answer which exonerates the practice inquestion from impropriety when a stranger expresses wonder at thesingularity of what he sees any inhabitant will naturally not o stranger this is our custom and you may verylikely have some other custom about the same things now we arespeaking my friends not about men in general but about the meritsand defects of the lawgivers themselves let us then discourse alittle more at length about intoxication which is a very importantsubject and will seriously task the discrimination of the am not speaking of drinking or not drinking wine at all but ofintoxication are we to follow the custom of the scythians andpersians and carthaginians and celts and iberians and are all warlike nations or that of your countrymen for you say altogether abstain but the scythians and men and women drink unmixed wine which they pour on theirgarments and this they think a happy and glorious institution thepersians again are much given to other practices of luxury which youreject but they have more moderation in them than the thracians andscythians 
 meg o best of men we have only to take arms into our hands and wesend all these nations flying before us 
 ath nay my good friend do not say that there have been as therealways will be flights and pursuits of which no account can be therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affordsmore than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser as thesyracusans have done the locrians who appear to be people in their part of the world or as the athenianshave done the ceans and there are ten thousand other instances of thesame sort of thing all this is not to the point let us endeavourrather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and saynothing at present of victories and defeats let us only say thatsuch and such a custom is honourable and another not and firstpermit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated inreference to these very matters 
 meg how do you mean 
 ath all those who are ready at a notice to praise orcensure any practice which is matter of discussion seem to me toproceed in a wrong way let me give you an illustration of what may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kindof food whereupon another person instantly blames wheat without everenquiring into its effect or use or in what way or to whom orwith what or in what state and how wheat is to be given and that isjust what we are doing in this discussion at the very mention ofthe word intoxication one side is ready with their praises and theother with their censures which is absurd for either side adducetheir witnesses and approvers and some of us think that we speak withauthority because we have many witnesses and others because theysee those who abstain conquering in battle and this again is disputedby us now i cannot say that i shall be satisfied if we go ondiscussing each of the remaining laws in the same way and aboutthis very point of intoxication i should like to speak in another i hold to be the right one for if number is to be thecriterion are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready todispute the point with you who are only two cities 
 meg i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right 
 ath let me put the matter a person to praise thekeeping of goats and the creatures themselves as capital things tohave and then some one who had seen goats feeding without agoatherd in cultivated spots and doing mischief were to censure agoat or any other animal who has no keeper or a bad keeper wouldthere be any sense or justice in such censure 
 meg certainly not 
 ath does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in orderto be a good captain whether he is or not what do you say 
 meg i say that he is not a good captain if although he havenautical skill he is liable to 
 ath and what would you say of the commander of an army will hebe able to command merely because he has military skill if he be acoward who when danger comes is sick and drunk with fear 
 meg impossible 
 ath and what if besides being a coward he has no skill 
 meg he is a miserable fellow not fit to be a commander of men butonly of old women 
 ath and what would you say of some one who blames or praises anysort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler and iswell enough when under his presidency the critic however hasnever seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast underthe control of a president but always without a ruler or with a observers of this class praise or blame such meetings arewe to suppose that what they say is of any value 
 meg certainly not if they have never seen or been present atsuch a meeting when rightly ordered 
 ath reflect may not banqueters and banquets be said toconstitute a kind of meeting 
 meg of course 
 ath and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightlyordered of course you two will answer that you have never seen themat all because they are not customary or lawful in your i have come across many of them in many different places andmoreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went as i maysay and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which wascarried on altogether rightly in some few particulars they might beright but in general they were utterly wrong 
 cle what do you mean stranger by this remark explain for we asyou say from our inexperience in such matters might very likelynot know even if they came in our way what was right or wrong insuch societies 
 ath likely enough then let me try to be your instructor you wouldacknowledge would you not that in all gatherings of man kind ofwhatever sort there ought to be a leader 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath and we were saying just now that when men are at war theleader ought to be a brave man 
 cle we were 
 ath the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed byfears 
 cle that again is true 
 ath and if there were a possibility of having a general of anarmy who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable should we not byall means appoint him 
 cle assuredly 
 ath now however we are speaking not of a general who is tocommand an army when foe meets foe in time of war but of one whois to regulate meetings of another sort when friend meets friend intime of peace 
 cle true 
 ath and that sort of meeting if attended with drunkenness isapt to be unquiet 
 cle certainly the reverse of quiet 
 ath in the first place then the revellers as well as the soldierswill require a ruler 
 cle to be sure no men more so 
 ath and we ought if possible to provide them with a quiet ruler 
 cle of course 
 ath and he should be a man who understands society for his duty isto preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at thetime and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion 
 cle very true 
 ath must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our masterof the revels for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young anddrunken and not only by some special good fortune willhe be saved from doing some great evil 
 cle it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved 
 ath now suppose such associations to be framed in the best waypossible in states and that some one blames the very fact of may very likely be right but if he blames a practicewhich he only sees very much mismanaged he shows in the first placethat he is not aware of the mismanagement and also not aware thateverything done in this way will turn out to be wrong because donewithout the superintendence of a sober ruler do you not see that adrunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin in short of which he has the direction 
 cle the last remark is very true stranger and i see quite clearlythe advantage of an army having a good will give victoryin war to his followers which is a very great advantage and so ofother things but i do not see any similar advantage which eitherindividuals or states gain from the good management of a feast andi want you to tell me what great good will be effected supposing thatthis drinking ordinance is duly established 
 ath if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state fromthe right training of a single youth or of a single thequestion is put in that form we cannot deny that the good is not verygreat in any particular instance but if you ask what is the good ofeducation in general the answer is education makes goodmen and that good men act nobly and conquer their enemies in they are good education certainly gives victory althoughvictory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education for many havegrown insolent from victory in war and this insolence hasengendered in them innumerable evils and many a victory has beenand will be suicidal to the victors but education is never suicidal 
 cle you seem to imply my friend that convivial meetings whenrightly ordered are an important element of education 
 ath certainly i do 
 cle and can you show that what you have been saying is true 
 ath to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerningwhich there are many opinions is an attribute of the gods not givento man stranger but i shall be very happy to tell you what ithink especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussionconcerning laws and constitutions 
 cle your opinion stranger about the questions which are now beingraised is precisely what we want to hear 
 ath very good i will try to find a way of explaining my you shall try to have the gift of understanding me but firstlet me make an apology the athenian citizen is reputed among allthe hellenes to be a great talker whereas sparta is renowned forbrevity and the cretans have more wit than words now i am afraidof appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very smallmaterials for drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter andyet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to correct principles of music these are necessary to anyclear or satisfactory treatment of the subject and music again runsup into education generally and there is much to be said about allthis what would you say then to leaving these matters for thepresent and passing on to some other question of law 
 meg o athenian stranger let me tell you what perhaps you do notknow that our family is the proxenus of your state i imagine thatfrom their earliest youth all boys when they are told that they arethe proxeni of a particular state feel kindly towards their secondand this has certainly been my own feeling i can well remember fromthe days of my boyhood how when any lacedaemonians praised or blamedthe athenians they used to say to megillus how ill or howwell as the case might be has your state treated us and havingalways had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard youassailed i became warmly attached to you and i always like to hearthe athenian tongue spoken the common saying is quite true that agood athenian is more than ordinarily good for he is the only man whois freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his ownnature and is not manufactured therefore be assured that i shalllike to hear you say whatever you have to say 
 cle yes stranger and when you have heard me speak say boldlywhat is in your thoughts let me remind you of a tie which unitesyou to crete you must have heard here the story of the prophetepimenides who was of my family and came to athens ten yearsbefore the persian war in accordance with the response of the offered certain sacrifices which the god commanded theathenians were at that time in dread of the persian invasion and hesaid that for ten years they would not come and that when theycame they would go away again without accomplishing any of theirobjects and would suffer more evil than they inflicted at thattime my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you thusancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for you 
 ath you seem to be quite ready to listen and i am also ready toperform as much as i can of an almost impossible task which i willnevertheless attempt at the outset of the discussion let me definethe nature and power of education for this is the way by which ourargument must travel onwards to the god dionysus 
 cle let us proceed if you please 
 ath well then if i tell you what are my notions of you consider whether they satisfy you 
 cle let us hear 
 ath according to my view any one who would be good at anythingmust practise that thing from his youth upwards both in sport andearnest in its several branches for example he who is to be agood builder should play at building houses he who isto be a good husbandman at tilling the ground and those who have thecare of their education should provide them when young with mimictools they should learn beforehand the knowledge which they willafterwards require for their art for example the future carpentershould learn to measure or apply the line in play and the futurewarrior should learn riding or some other exercise for the teacher should endeavour to direct the inclinationsand pleasures by the help of amusements to their final aim inlife the most important part of education is right training in thenursery the soul of the child in his play should be guided to thelove of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhoodhe will have to be perfected do you agree with me thus far 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous at present when we speak in terms of praise or blameabout the of each person we call one man educated andanother uneducated although the uneducated man may be sometimesvery well educated for the calling of a retail trader or of a captainof a ship and the like for we are not speaking of education inthis narrower sense but of that other education in virtue fromyouth upwards which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfectionof citizenship and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to is the only education which upon our view deserves the other sort of training which aims at the acquisition of wealthor bodily strength or mere cleverness apart from intelligence andjustice is mean and illiberal and is not worthy to be callededucation at all but let us not quarrel with one another about aword provided that the proposition which has just been granted holdgood to wit that those who are rightly educated generally becomegood men neither must we cast a slight upon education which is thefirst and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have and liable to take a wrong direction is capable of this work of reformation is the great business of every manwhile he lives 
 cle very true and we entirely agree with you 
 ath and we agreed before that they are good men who are able torule themselves and bad men who are not 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath let me now proceed if i can to clear up the subject alittle further by an illustration which i will offer you 
 cle proceed 
 ath do we not consider each of ourselves to be one 
 cle we do 
 ath and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors bothfoolish and also antagonistic of which we call the one the other pain 
 cle exactly 
 ath also there are opinions about the future which have thegeneral name of expectations and the specific name of fear whenthe expectation is of pain and of hope when of pleasure andfurther there is reflection about the good or evil of them and embodied in a decree by the state is called law 
 cle i am hardly able to follow you proceed however as if i were 
 meg i am in the like case 
 ath let us look at the matter thus may we not conceive each ofus living beings to be a puppet of the gods either their playthingonly or created with a of the two we cannot certainlyknow but we do know that these affections in us are like cords andstrings which pull us different and opposite ways and to oppositeactions and herein lies the difference between virtue and to the argument there is one among these cords which everyman ought to grasp and never let go but to pull with it against allthe rest and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason calledby us the common law of the state there are others which are hard andof iron but this one is soft because golden and there are severalother kinds now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of thebest which is law for inasmuch as reason is beautiful and not violent her rule must needs have ministers in order to helpthe golden principle in vanquishing the other principles and thus themoral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost andthe meaning of the expression superior or inferior to a become clearer and the individual attaining to right reasonin this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet should liveaccording to its rule while the city receiving the same from somegod or from one who has knowledge of these things should embody it ina law to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with otherstates in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguishedby us and when they have become clearer education and otherinstitutions will in like manner become clearer and in particularthat question of convivial entertainment which may seem have been a very trifling matter and to have taken a great manymore words than were necessary 
 cle perhaps however the theme may turn out not to be unworthyof the length of discourse 
 ath very good let us proceed with any enquiry which really bearson our present object 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we give this puppet of ours will be theeffect on him 
 cle having what in view do you ask that question 
 ath nothing as yet but i ask generally when the puppet is broughtto the drink what sort of result is likely to follow i willendeavour to explain my meaning more clearly what i am now askingis the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasuresand pains and passions and loves 
 cle very greatly 
 ath and are perception and memory and opinion and and increased do not these qualities entirely desert a manif he becomes saturated with drink 
 cle yes they entirely desert him 
 ath does he not return to the state of soul in which he was whena young child 
 cle he does 
 ath then at that time he will have the least control over himself 
 cle the least 
 ath and will he not be in a most wretched plight 
 cle most wretched 
 ath then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a secondtime a child 
 cle well said stranger 
 ath is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought toencourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can toavoid it 
 cle i suppose that there is you at any rate were just nowsaying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine 
 ath true i was and i am ready still seeing that you have bothdeclared that you are anxious to hear me 
 cle to sure we are if only for the strangeness of the asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge intoutter degradation 
 ath are you speaking of the soul 
 cle yes 
 ath and what would you say about the body my friend are you notsurprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himselfdeformity leanness ugliness decrepitude 
 cle certainly 
 ath yet when a man goes of his own accord to a shop andtakes medicine is he not aware that soon and for many daysafterwards he will be in a state of body which he would die ratherthan accept as the permanent condition of his life are not thosewho train in gymnasia at first beginning reduced to a state ofweakness 
 cle yes all that is well known 
 ath also that they go of their own accord for the sake of thesubsequent benefit 
 cle very good 
 ath and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of otherpractices 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows 
 cle to be sure 
 ath if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantageequal in importance to that of gymnastic they are in their verynature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise inasmuch as theyhave no accompaniment of pain 
 cle true but i hardly think that we shall be able to discoverany such benefits to be derived from them 
 ath that is just what we must endeavour to show and let me ask youa we not distinguish two kinds of fear which are verydifferent 
 cle what are they 
 ath there is the fear of expected evil 
 cle yes 
 ath and there is the fear of an evil reputation we are afraidof being thought evil because we do or say some dishonourablething which fear we and all men term shame 
 cle certainly 
 ath these are the two fears as i called them one of which isthe opposite of pain and other fears and the opposite also of thegreatest and most numerous sort of pleasures 
 cle very true 
 ath and does not the legislator and every one who is good foranything hold this fear in the greatest honour this is what he termsreverence and the confidence which is the reverse of this he termsinsolence and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil bothto individuals and to states 
 cle true 
 ath does not this kind of fear preserve us in many importantways what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in there are two things which give before fear of disgrace before friends 
 cle there are 
 ath then each of us should be fearless and also fearful and why weshould be either has now been determined 
 cle certainly 
 ath and when we want to make any one fearless we and the law bringhim face to face with many fears 
 cle clearly 
 ath and when we want to make him rightly fearful must we notintroduce him to shameless pleasures and train him to take up armsagainst them and to overcome them or does this principle apply tocourage only and must he who would be perfect in valour fight againstand overcome his own natural if he be unpractisedand inexperienced in such conflicts he will not be half the man whichhe might have are we to suppose that with temperance it isotherwise and that he who has never fought with the shameless andunrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts and conqueredthem in earnest and in play by word deed and act will still beperfectly temperate 
 cle a most unlikely supposition 
 ath suppose that some god had given a to men andthat the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself atevery draught as a child of misfortune and that he fearedeverything happening or about to happen to him and that at last themost courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a only came to himself again when he had slept off the influenceof the draught 
 cle but has such a draught stranger ever really been knownamong men 
 ath no but if there had been might not such a draught havebeen of use to the legislator as a test of courage might we not goand say to him o legislator whether you are legislating for thecretan or for any other state would you not like to have atouchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens 
 cle i should will be the answer of every one 
 ath and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is norisk and no great danger than the reverse 
 cle in that proposition every one may safely agree 
 ath and in order to make use of the draught you would lead themamid these imaginary terrors and prove them when the affection offear was working upon them and compel them to be and admonishing them and also honouring them butdishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in allrespects such as you command him and if he underwent the trial welland manfully you would let him go unscathed but if ill you wouldinflict a punishment upon him or would you abstain from using thepotion altogether although you have no reason for abstaining 
 cle he would be certain stranger to use the potion 
 ath this would be a mode of testing and training which would bewonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use and might beapplied to a single person or to a few or indeed to any he would do well who provided himself with the potion only ratherthan with any number of other things whether he preferred to be byhimself in solitude and there contend with his fears because hewas ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect ortrusting to the force of his own nature and habits and believing thathe had been already disciplined sufficiently he did not hesitate totrain himself in company with any number of others and display hispower in conquering the irresistible change effected by virtue being such that he never in any instance fell intoany great unseemliness but was always himself and left off before hearrived at the last cup fearing that he like all other men might beovercome by the potion 
 cle yes stranger in that last case too he might equally showhis 
 ath let us return to the lawgiver and say to is certainly no such which man has either receivedfrom the gods or himself discovered for witchcraft has no place atour board but is there any potion which might serve as a test ofoverboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting 
 cle i suppose that he will say that wine is such apotion 
 ath is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect ofthe other when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleasedwith himself and the more he drinks the more he is filled full ofbrave hopes and conceit of his power and at last the string of histongue is loosened and fancying himself wise he is brimming overwith lawlessness and has no more fear or respect and is ready todo or say anything 
 cle i think that every one will admit the truth of yourdescription 
 meg certainly 
 ath now let us remember as we were saying that there are twothings which should be cultivated in the soul first the greatestcourage secondly the greatest fear 
 cle which you said to be characteristic of reverence if i am notmistaken 
 ath thank you for reminding me but now as the habit of courageand fearlessness is to be trained amid fears let us considerwhether the opposite quality is not also to be trained amongopposites 
 cle that is probably the case 
 ath there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more thancommonly valiant and bold now we ought to train ourselves on theseoccasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness aspossible and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that isbase 
 cle true 
 ath are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold andshameless such as we are under the influence of pride ignorance avarice cowardice or when wealth and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden is better adapted than the festive use of wine in the firstplace to test and in the second place to train the character of aman if care be taken in the use of it what is there cheaper or moreinnocent for do but consider which is the greater yourather test a man of a morose and savage nature which is the sourceof ten thousand acts of injustice by making bargains with him at arisk to yourself or by having him as a companion at the festival ofdionysus or would you if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a manwho is prone to love entrust your wife or your sons or daughters tohim perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of thecondition of his soul i might mention numberless cases in whichthe advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character insport and without paying dearly for experience and i do notbelieve that either a cretan or any other man will doubt that such atest is a fair test and safer cheaper and speedier than any other 
 cle that is certainly true 
 ath and this knowledge of the natures and habits of soulswill be of the greatest use in that art which has the management ofthem and that art if i am not mistaken is politics 
 cle exactly so

 laws 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue an athenian stranger cleinias acretan megillus a lacedaemonian 
 athenian stranger tell me strangers is a god or some man supposedto be the author of your laws 
 cleinias a god stranger in very truth a god among us cretans heis said to have been zeus but in lacedaemon whence our friend herecomes i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver wouldthey not megillus 
 megillus certainly 
 ath and do you cleinias believe as homer tells that every ninthyear minos went to converse with his olympian sire and was inspiredby him to make laws for your cities 
 cle yes that is our tradition and there was rhadamanthus abrother of his with whose name you are familiar he is reputed tohave been the justest of men and we cretans are of opinion that heearned this reputation from his righteous administration of justicewhen he was alive 
 ath yes and a noble reputation it was worthy of a son of zeus asyou and megillus have been trained in these institutions i dare saythat you will not be unwilling to give an account of your governmentand laws on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and templeof zeus is considerable and doubtless there are shady places underthe lofty trees which will protect us from this scorching no longer young we may often stop to rest beneath them and getover the whole journey without difficulty beguiling the time byconversation 
 cle yes stranger and if we proceed onward we shall come to grovesof cypresses which are of rare height and beauty and there are greenmeadows in which we may repose and converse 
 ath very good 
 cle very good indeed and still better when we see them let usmove on cheerily 
 ath i am first i want to know why the law has ordainedthat you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises and weararms 
 cle i think stranger that the aim of our institutions is easilyintelligible to any one look at the character of our country creteis not like thessaly a large plain and for this reason they havehorsemen in thessaly and we have inequality of the groundin our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot but then if youhave runners you must have light one can carry a heavyweight when running and bows and arrows are convenient because theyare light now all these regulations have been made with a view towar and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in allhis common meals if i am not mistaken wereinstituted by him for a similar reason because he saw that while theyare in the field the citizens are by the nature of the casecompelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutualprotection he seems to me to have thought the world foolish in notunderstanding that all are always at war with one another and if inwar there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularlyappointed under others to protect an army they should be continued inpeace for what men in general term peace would be said by him to beonly a name in reality every city is in a natural state of war withevery other not indeed proclaimed by heralds but everlasting and ifyou look closely you will find that this was the intention of thecretan legislator all institutions private as well as public werearranged by him with a view to war in giving them he was under theimpression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to himwho is defeated in battle for all the good things of the conqueredpass into the hands of the conquerors 
 ath you appear to me stranger to have been thoroughly trainedin the cretan institutions and to be well informed about them willyou tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle ofgovernment which you would lay down you seem to imagine that a wellgoverned state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other statesin war am i right in supposing this to be your meaning 
 cle certainly and our lacedaemonian friend if i am notmistaken will agree with me 
 meg why my good friend how could any lacedaemonian say anythingelse 
 ath and is what you say applicable only to states or also tovillages 
 cle to both alike 
 ath the case is the same 
 cle yes 
 ath and in the village will there be the same war of family againstfamily and of individual against individual 
 cle the same 
 ath and should each man conceive himself to be his shall we say 
 cle o athenian of attica i will not call you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddessherself because you go back to first principles you have thrown alight upon the argument and will now be better able to understandwhat i was just all men are publicly one and each man privately his own 
 ath my good sir what do you mean 
 cle moreover there is a victory and first andbest of victories the lowest and worst of each mangains or sustains at the hands not of another but of himself thisshows that there is a war against ourselves going on within everyone of us 
 ath let us now reverse the order of the argument seeing that everyindividual is either his own superior or his own inferior may wesay that there is the same principle in the house the village andthe state 
 cle you mean that in each of them there is a principle ofsuperiority or inferiority to self 
 ath yes 
 cle you are quite right in asking the question for there certainlyis such a principle and above all in states and the state in whichthe better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferiorclasses may be truly said to be better than itself and may bejustly praised where such a victory is gained or censured in theopposite case 
 ath whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse is aquestion which requires more discussion and may be therefore left forthe present but i now quite understand your meaning when you say thatcitizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities mayunjustly conspire and having the superiority in numbers mayovercome and enslave the few just and when they prevail the statemay be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad and whenthey are defeated its own superior and therefore good 
 cle your remark stranger is a paradox and yet we cannot possiblydeny it 
 ath here is another case for a family there maybe several brothers who are the offspring of a single pair verypossibly the majority of them may be unjust and the just may be ina minority 
 cle very possibly 
 ath and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as towhether this family and household are rightly said to be superior whenthey conquer and inferior when they are conquered for we are not nowconsidering what may or may not be the proper or customary way ofspeaking but we are considering the natural principles of right andwrong in laws 
 cle what you say stranger is most true 
 meg quite excellent in my opinion as far as we have gone 
 ath again might there not be a judge over these brethren ofwhom we were speaking 
 cle certainly 
 ath now which would be the better who destroyed thebad and appointed the good to govern themselves or one who whileallowing the good to govern let the bad live and made themvoluntarily submit or third i suppose in the scale of excellencemight be placed a judge who finding the family distracted notonly did not destroy any one but reconciled them to one another forever after and gave them laws which they mutually observed and wasable to keep them friends 
 cle the last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator 
 ath and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be thereverse of war 
 cle very true 
 ath and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life ofman have in view external war or that kind of intestine war calledcivil which no one if he could prevent would like to have occurringin his own state and when occurring every one would wish to bequit of as soon as possible 
 cle he would have the latter chiefly in view 
 ath and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated bythe destruction of one of the parties and by the victory of theother or that peace and friendship should be andthat being reconciled they should give their attention to foreignenemies 
 cle every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state 
 ath and would not that also be the desire of the legislator 
 cle certainly 
 ath and would not every one always make laws for the sake of thebest 
 cle to be sure 
 ath but war whether external or civil is not the best and theneed of either is to be deprecated but peace with one another andgood will are best nor is the victory of the state over itself to beregarded as a really good thing but as a necessity a man might aswell say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged bymedicine forgetting that there is also a state of the body whichneeds no purge and in like manner no one can be a true he aims at the happiness of the individual or state who looksonly or first of all to external warfare nor will he ever be asound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war and not war forthe sake of peace 
 cle i suppose that there is truth stranger in that remark ofyours and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aimand object of our own institutions and also of the lacedaemonian 
 ath i dare say but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrelwith one another about your legislators instead of gently questioningthem seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest pleasefollow me and the argument first i will put forwardtyrtaeus an athenian by birth but also a spartan citizen who of allmen was most eager about war well he says i sing not i carenot about any man even if he were the richest of men andpossessed every good and then he gives a whole list of them if hebe not at all times a brave warrior i imagine that you too musthave heard his poems our lacedaemonian friend has probably heard morethan enough of them 
 meg very true 
 cle and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete 
 ath come now and let us all join in asking this question oftyrtaeus o most divine poet we will say to him the excellent praisewhich you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficientlyproves that you are wise and good and i and megillus and cleiniasof cnosus do as i believe entirely agree with you but we shouldlike to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men tell do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds ofwar or what would you say a far inferior man to tyrtaeus wouldhave no difficulty in replying quite truly that war is of two kindsone which is universally called civil war and is as we were justnow saying of all wars the worst the other as we should alladmit in which we fall out with other nations who are of adifferent race is a far milder form of warfare 
 cle certainly far milder 
 ath well now when you praise and blame war in this whom are you praising or blaming and to which kind of war areyou referring i suppose that you must mean foreign war if i am tojudge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominatethose 
 who refuse to look upon fields of blood and will not draw nearand strike at their we shall naturally go on to say to tyrtaeus as it those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign he must admit this 
 cle evidently 
 ath they are good but we say that there are still better men whosevirtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles and we too havea poet whom we summon as a witness theognis citizen of megara insicily 
 cyrnus he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight ingold and such an one is far better as we affirm than the other in amore difficult kind of war much in the same degree as justice andtemperance and wisdom when united with courage are better thancourage only for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strifewithout having all virtue but in the war of which tyrtaeus a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die athis post and yet they are generally and almost without exceptioninsolent unjust violent men and the most senseless of human will ask what the conclusion is and what i am seeking to prove imaintain that the divine legislator of crete like any other who isworthy of consideration will always and above all things in makinglaws have regard to the greatest virtue which according to loyalty in the hour of danger and may be truly called perfectjustice whereas that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is wellenough and was praised by the poet at the right time yet in placeand dignity may be said to be only fourth rate 
 cle stranger we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rankwhich is far beneath him 
 ath nay i think that we degrade not him but ourselves if weimagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemonand crete mainly with a view to war 
 cle what ought we to say then 
 ath what truth and what justice require of us if i am notmistaken when speaking in behalf of divine thelegislator when making his laws had in view not a part only andthis the lowest part of virtue but all virtue and that he devisedclasses of laws answering to the kinds of virtue not in the way inwhich modern inventors of laws make the classes for they onlyinvestigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt and one man hasa class of laws about allotments and heiresses another aboutassaults others about ten thousand other such matters but wemaintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as wehave now done and i admired the spirit of your exposition for youwere quite right in beginning with virtue and saying that this wasthe aim of the giver of the law but i thought that you went wrongwhen you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part andthe least part of virtue and this called forth my subsequent you allow me then to explain how i should have liked to haveheard you expound the matter 
 cle by all means 
 ath you ought to have said cretan laws are withreason famous among the hellenes for they fulfil the object oflaws which is to make those who use them happy and they confer everysort of good now goods are of two kinds there are human and thereare divine goods and the human hang upon the divine and the statewhich attains the greater at the same time acquires the less or nothaving the greater has neither of the lesser goods the first ishealth the second beauty the third strength including swiftnessin running and bodily agility generally and the fourth is wealth notthe blind god pluto but one who is keen of sight if only he haswisdom for his companion for wisdom is chief and leader of the divinedass of goods and next follows temperance and from the union ofthese two with courage springs justice and fourth in the scale ofvirtue is courage all these naturally take precedence of the othergoods and this is the order in which the legislator must placethem and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances onthe citizens with a view to these the human looking to the the divine looking to their leader mind some of his ordinanceswill relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with then to the procreation and education of children both male andfemale the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of hiscitizens in youth and age and at every time of life and to givethem punishments and rewards and in reference to all theirintercourse with one another he ought to consider their pains andpleasures and desires and the vehemence of all their passions heshould keep a watch over them and blame and praise them rightly bythe mouth of the laws themselves also with regard to anger andterror and the other perturbations of the soul which arise out ofmisfortune and the deliverances from them which prosperity the experiences which come to men in diseases or in war orpoverty or the opposite of these in all these states he shoulddetermine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition ofeach in the next place the legislator has to be careful how thecitizens make their money and in what way they spend it and to havean eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of voluntary or involuntary he should see how they order allthis and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or iswanting in their several dealings with one another and honour thosewho obey the law and impose fixed penalties on those who the round of civil life is ended and the time has come forthe consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the the lawgiver reviewing his work will appoint guardians to presideover these who walk by intelligence others by trueopinion only and then mind will bind together all his ordinancesand show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice and notwith wealth or ambition this is the spirit stranger in which iwas and am desirous that you should pursue the subject and i wantto know the nature of all these things and how they are arranged inthe laws of zeus as they are termed and in those of the pythianapollo which minos and lycurgus gave and how the order of them isdiscovered to his eyes who has experience in laws gained either bystudy or habit although they are far from being to therest of mankind like ourselves 
 cle how shall we proceed stranger 
 ath i think that we must begin again as before and firstconsider the habit of courage and then we will go on and discussanother and then another form of virtue if you please in this way weshall have a model of the whole and with these and similar discourseswe will beguile the way and when we have gone through all thevirtues we will show by the grace of god that the institutions ofwhich i was speaking look to virtue 
 meg very good and suppose that you first criticize this praiser ofzeus and the laws of crete 
 ath i will try to criticize you and myself as well as him for theargument is a common concern tell not first the syssitia andsecondly the gymnasia invented by your legislator with a view to war 
 meg yes 
 ath and what comes third and what fourth for that i think isthe sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remainingparts of virtue no matter whether you call them parts or what theirname is provided the meaning is clear 
 meg then i or any other lacedaemonian would reply that hunting isthird in order 
 ath let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth 
 meg i think that i can get as far as the fouth head which is thefrequent endurance of pain exhibited among us spartans in fights also in stealing with the prospect of getting agood beating there is too the crypteia or secretservice in which wonderful endurance is people wanderover the whole country by day and by night and even in winter havenot a shoe to their foot and are without beds to lie upon and haveto attend upon themselves marvellous too is the endurance which ourcitizens show in their naked exercises contending against the violentsummer heat and there are many similar practices to speak of whichin detail would be endless 
 ath excellent o lacedaemonian stranger but how ought we to definecourage is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears andpains or also against desires and pleasures and againstflatteries which exercise such a tremendous power that they make thehearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax 
 meg i should say the latter 
 ath in what preceded as you will remember our cnosian friendwas speaking of a man or a city being inferior to younot cleinias 
 cle i was 
 ath now which is in the truest sense inferior the man who isovercome by pleasure or by pain 
 cle i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure for all mendeem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense than the otherwho is overcome by pain 
 ath but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have notlegislated for a courage which is lame of one leg able only to meetattacks which come from the left but impotent against the insidiousflatteries which come from the right 
 cle able to meet both i should say 
 ath then let me once more ask what institutions have you in eitherof your states which give a taste of pleasures and do not avoidthem any more than they avoid pains but which set a person in themidst of them and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward toget the better of them where is an ordinance about pleasure similarto that about pain to be found in your laws tell me what there isof this nature among is there which makes your citizenequally brave against pleasure and pain conquering what they ought toconquer and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous andnearest home 
 meg i was able to tell you stranger many laws which were directedagainst pain but i do not know that i can point out any great orobvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned withpleasure there are some lesser provisions however which i mightmention 
 cle neither can i show anything of that sort which is at allequally prominent in the cretan laws 
 ath no wonder my dear friends and if as is very likely in oursearch after the true and good one of us may have to censure the lawsof the others we must not be offended but take kindly what anothersays 
 cle you are quite right athenian stranger and we will do as yousay 
 ath at our time of life cleinias there should be no feeling ofirritation 
 cle certainly not 
 ath i will not at present determine whether he who censures thecretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong but i believe thati can tell better than either of you what the many say about them forassuming that you have reasonably good laws one of the best of themwill be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of themare right or wrong but with one mouth and one voice they must allagree that the laws are all good for they came from god and anyone who says the contrary is not to be listened to but an old man whoremarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to aruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present 
 cle exactly so stranger and like a diviner although not there atthe time you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of thelegislator and to say what is most true 
 ath as there are no young men present and the legislator has givenold men free licence there will be no impropriety in our discussingthese very matters now that we are alone 
 cle true and therefore you may be as free as you like in yourcensure of our laws for there is no discredit in knowing what iswrong he who receives what is said in a generous and friendlyspirit will be all the better for it 
 ath very good however i am not going to say anything against yourlaws until to the best of my ability i have examined them but i amgoing to raise doubts about them for you are the only people known tous whether greek or barbarian whom the legislator commanded toeschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch in the matter of pains or fears which we have just beendiscussing he thought that they who from infancy had always avoidedpains and fears and sorrows when they were compelled to face themwould run away from those who were hardened in them and wouldbecome their subjects now the legislator ought to have consideredthat this was equally true of pleasure he should have said tohimself that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquaintedwith the greatest pleasures and unused to endure amid the temptationsof pleasure and are not disciplined to refrain from all thingsevil the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fearwould overcome the former class and in another and even a worsemanner they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amidpleasures and have had the opportunity of enjoying them they beingoften the worst of mankind one half of their souls will be a other half free and they will not be worthy to be called in thetrue sense men and freemen tell me whether you assent to my words 
 cle on first hearing what you say appears to be the truth butto be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matterswould be very childish and simple 
 ath suppose cleinias and megillus that we consider the virtuewhich follows next of those which we intended to discuss for aftercourage comes temperance what institutions shall we find relating totemperance either in crete or lacedaemon which like your militaryinstitutions differ from those of any ordinary state 
 meg that is not an easy question to answer still i should say thatthe common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devisedfor the promotion both of temperance and courage 
 ath there seems to be a difficulty stranger with regard tostates in making words and facts coincide so that there can be nodispute about them as in the human body the regimen which doesgood in one way does harm in another and we can hardly say that anyone course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution nowthe gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good and yet theyare a source of evil in civil troubles as is shown in the case of themilesian and boeotian and thurian youth among whom theseinstitutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancientand natural custom of love below the level not only of man but ofthe beasts the charge may be fairly brought against your cities aboveall others and is true also of most other states which especiallycultivate gymnastics whether such matters are to be regardedjestingly or seriously i think that the pleasure is to be deemednatural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women butthat the intercourse of men with men or of women with women iscontrary to nature and that the bold attempt was originally due tounbridled lust the cretans are always accused of having inventedthe story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted to justifythemselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practiceof the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver leavingthe story we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almostentirely on pleasure and pain both in states and in are two fountains which nature lets flow and he who drawsfrom them where and when and as much as he ought is happy andthis holds of men and individuals as well as states and hewho indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time is thereverse of happy 
 meg i admit stranger that your words are well spoken and ihardly know what to say in answer to you but still i think that thespartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure of the cretanlaws i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend but the lawsof sparta in as far as they relate to pleasure appear to me to bethe best in the world for that which leads mankind in general intothe wildest pleasure and licence and every other folly the law hasclean driven out and neither in the country nor in towns which areunder the control of sparta will you find revelries and the manyincitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them and anyone who meets a drunken and disorderly person will immediately havehim most severely punished and will not let him off on anypretence not even at the time of a dionysiac festival although ihave remarked that this may happen at your performances on the they are called and among our tarentine colonists i have seenthe whole city drunk at a dionysiac festival but nothing of thesort happens among us 
 ath o lacedaemonian stranger these festivities are praiseworthywhere there is a spirit of endurance but are very senseless when theyare under no regulations in order to retaliate an athenian hasonly to point out the licence which exists among your women to allsuch accusations whether they are brought against the us or you there is one answer which exonerates the practice inquestion from impropriety when a stranger expresses wonder at thesingularity of what he sees any inhabitant will naturally not o stranger this is our custom and you may verylikely have some other custom about the same things now we arespeaking my friends not about men in general but about the meritsand defects of the lawgivers themselves let us then discourse alittle more at length about intoxication which is a very importantsubject and will seriously task the discrimination of the am not speaking of drinking or not drinking wine at all but ofintoxication are we to follow the custom of the scythians andpersians and carthaginians and celts and iberians and are all warlike nations or that of your countrymen for you say altogether abstain but the scythians and men and women drink unmixed wine which they pour on theirgarments and this they think a happy and glorious institution thepersians again are much given to other practices of luxury which youreject but they have more moderation in them than the thracians andscythians 
 meg o best of men we have only to take arms into our hands and wesend all these nations flying before us 
 ath nay my good friend do not say that there have been as therealways will be flights and pursuits of which no account can be therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affordsmore than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser as thesyracusans have done the locrians who appear to be people in their part of the world or as the athenianshave done the ceans and there are ten thousand other instances of thesame sort of thing all this is not to the point let us endeavourrather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and saynothing at present of victories and defeats let us only say thatsuch and such a custom is honourable and another not and firstpermit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated inreference to these very matters 
 meg how do you mean 
 ath all those who are ready at a notice to praise orcensure any practice which is matter of discussion seem to me toproceed in a wrong way let me give you an illustration of what may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kindof food whereupon another person instantly blames wheat without everenquiring into its effect or use or in what way or to whom orwith what or in what state and how wheat is to be given and that isjust what we are doing in this discussion at the very mention ofthe word intoxication one side is ready with their praises and theother with their censures which is absurd for either side adducetheir witnesses and approvers and some of us think that we speak withauthority because we have many witnesses and others because theysee those who abstain conquering in battle and this again is disputedby us now i cannot say that i shall be satisfied if we go ondiscussing each of the remaining laws in the same way and aboutthis very point of intoxication i should like to speak in another i hold to be the right one for if number is to be thecriterion are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready todispute the point with you who are only two cities 
 meg i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right 
 ath let me put the matter a person to praise thekeeping of goats and the creatures themselves as capital things tohave and then some one who had seen goats feeding without agoatherd in cultivated spots and doing mischief were to censure agoat or any other animal who has no keeper or a bad keeper wouldthere be any sense or justice in such censure 
 meg certainly not 
 ath does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in orderto be a good captain whether he is or not what do you say 
 meg i say that he is not a good captain if although he havenautical skill he is liable to 
 ath and what would you say of the commander of an army will hebe able to command merely because he has military skill if he be acoward who when danger comes is sick and drunk with fear 
 meg impossible 
 ath and what if besides being a coward he has no skill 
 meg he is a miserable fellow not fit to be a commander of men butonly of old women 
 ath and what would you say of some one who blames or praises anysort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler and iswell enough when under his presidency the critic however hasnever seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast underthe control of a president but always without a ruler or with a observers of this class praise or blame such meetings arewe to suppose that what they say is of any value 
 meg certainly not if they have never seen or been present atsuch a meeting when rightly ordered 
 ath reflect may not banqueters and banquets be said toconstitute a kind of meeting 
 meg of course 
 ath and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightlyordered of course you two will answer that you have never seen themat all because they are not customary or lawful in your i have come across many of them in many different places andmoreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went as i maysay and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which wascarried on altogether rightly in some few particulars they might beright but in general they were utterly wrong 
 cle what do you mean stranger by this remark explain for we asyou say from our inexperience in such matters might very likelynot know even if they came in our way what was right or wrong insuch societies 
 ath likely enough then let me try to be your instructor you wouldacknowledge would you not that in all gatherings of man kind ofwhatever sort there ought to be a leader 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath and we were saying just now that when men are at war theleader ought to be a brave man 
 cle we were 
 ath the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed byfears 
 cle that again is true 
 ath and if there were a possibility of having a general of anarmy who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable should we not byall means appoint him 
 cle assuredly 
 ath now however we are speaking not of a general who is tocommand an army when foe meets foe in time of war but of one whois to regulate meetings of another sort when friend meets friend intime of peace 
 cle true 
 ath and that sort of meeting if attended with drunkenness isapt to be unquiet 
 cle certainly the reverse of quiet 
 ath in the first place then the revellers as well as the soldierswill require a ruler 
 cle to be sure no men more so 
 ath and we ought if possible to provide them with a quiet ruler 
 cle of course 
 ath and he should be a man who understands society for his duty isto preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at thetime and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion 
 cle very true 
 ath must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our masterof the revels for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young anddrunken and not only by some special good fortune willhe be saved from doing some great evil 
 cle it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved 
 ath now suppose such associations to be framed in the best waypossible in states and that some one blames the very fact of may very likely be right but if he blames a practicewhich he only sees very much mismanaged he shows in the first placethat he is not aware of the mismanagement and also not aware thateverything done in this way will turn out to be wrong because donewithout the superintendence of a sober ruler do you not see that adrunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin in short of which he has the direction 
 cle the last remark is very true stranger and i see quite clearlythe advantage of an army having a good will give victoryin war to his followers which is a very great advantage and so ofother things but i do not see any similar advantage which eitherindividuals or states gain from the good management of a feast andi want you to tell me what great good will be effected supposing thatthis drinking ordinance is duly established 
 ath if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state fromthe right training of a single youth or of a single thequestion is put in that form we cannot deny that the good is not verygreat in any particular instance but if you ask what is the good ofeducation in general the answer is education makes goodmen and that good men act nobly and conquer their enemies in they are good education certainly gives victory althoughvictory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education for many havegrown insolent from victory in war and this insolence hasengendered in them innumerable evils and many a victory has beenand will be suicidal to the victors but education is never suicidal 
 cle you seem to imply my friend that convivial meetings whenrightly ordered are an important element of education 
 ath certainly i do 
 cle and can you show that what you have been saying is true 
 ath to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerningwhich there are many opinions is an attribute of the gods not givento man stranger but i shall be very happy to tell you what ithink especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussionconcerning laws and constitutions 
 cle your opinion stranger about the questions which are now beingraised is precisely what we want to hear 
 ath very good i will try to find a way of explaining my you shall try to have the gift of understanding me but firstlet me make an apology the athenian citizen is reputed among allthe hellenes to be a great talker whereas sparta is renowned forbrevity and the cretans have more wit than words now i am afraidof appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very smallmaterials for drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter andyet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to correct principles of music these are necessary to anyclear or satisfactory treatment of the subject and music again runsup into education generally and there is much to be said about allthis what would you say then to leaving these matters for thepresent and passing on to some other question of law 
 meg o athenian stranger let me tell you what perhaps you do notknow that our family is the proxenus of your state i imagine thatfrom their earliest youth all boys when they are told that they arethe proxeni of a particular state feel kindly towards their secondand this has certainly been my own feeling i can well remember fromthe days of my boyhood how when any lacedaemonians praised or blamedthe athenians they used to say to megillus how ill or howwell as the case might be has your state treated us and havingalways had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard youassailed i became warmly attached to you and i always like to hearthe athenian tongue spoken the common saying is quite true that agood athenian is more than ordinarily good for he is the only man whois freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his ownnature and is not manufactured therefore be assured that i shalllike to hear you say whatever you have to say 
 cle yes stranger and when you have heard me speak say boldlywhat is in your thoughts let me remind you of a tie which unitesyou to crete you must have heard here the story of the prophetepimenides who was of my family and came to athens ten yearsbefore the persian war in accordance with the response of the offered certain sacrifices which the god commanded theathenians were at that time in dread of the persian invasion and hesaid that for ten years they would not come and that when theycame they would go away again without accomplishing any of theirobjects and would suffer more evil than they inflicted at thattime my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you thusancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for you 
 ath you seem to be quite ready to listen and i am also ready toperform as much as i can of an almost impossible task which i willnevertheless attempt at the outset of the discussion let me definethe nature and power of education for this is the way by which ourargument must travel onwards to the god dionysus 
 cle let us proceed if you please 
 ath well then if i tell you what are my notions of you consider whether they satisfy you 
 cle let us hear 
 ath according to my view any one who would be good at anythingmust practise that thing from his youth upwards both in sport andearnest in its several branches for example he who is to be agood builder should play at building houses he who isto be a good husbandman at tilling the ground and those who have thecare of their education should provide them when young with mimictools they should learn beforehand the knowledge which they willafterwards require for their art for example the future carpentershould learn to measure or apply the line in play and the futurewarrior should learn riding or some other exercise for the teacher should endeavour to direct the inclinationsand pleasures by the help of amusements to their final aim inlife the most important part of education is right training in thenursery the soul of the child in his play should be guided to thelove of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhoodhe will have to be perfected do you agree with me thus far 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous at present when we speak in terms of praise or blameabout the of each person we call one man educated andanother uneducated although the uneducated man may be sometimesvery well educated for the calling of a retail trader or of a captainof a ship and the like for we are not speaking of education inthis narrower sense but of that other education in virtue fromyouth upwards which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfectionof citizenship and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to is the only education which upon our view deserves the other sort of training which aims at the acquisition of wealthor bodily strength or mere cleverness apart from intelligence andjustice is mean and illiberal and is not worthy to be callededucation at all but let us not quarrel with one another about aword provided that the proposition which has just been granted holdgood to wit that those who are rightly educated generally becomegood men neither must we cast a slight upon education which is thefirst and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have and liable to take a wrong direction is capable of this work of reformation is the great business of every manwhile he lives 
 cle very true and we entirely agree with you 
 ath and we agreed before that they are good men who are able torule themselves and bad men who are not 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath let me now proceed if i can to clear up the subject alittle further by an illustration which i will offer you 
 cle proceed 
 ath do we not consider each of ourselves to be one 
 cle we do 
 ath and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors bothfoolish and also antagonistic of which we call the one the other pain 
 cle exactly 
 ath also there are opinions about the future which have thegeneral name of expectations and the specific name of fear whenthe expectation is of pain and of hope when of pleasure andfurther there is reflection about the good or evil of them and embodied in a decree by the state is called law 
 cle i am hardly able to follow you proceed however as if i were 
 meg i am in the like case 
 ath let us look at the matter thus may we not conceive each ofus living beings to be a puppet of the gods either their playthingonly or created with a of the two we cannot certainlyknow but we do know that these affections in us are like cords andstrings which pull us different and opposite ways and to oppositeactions and herein lies the difference between virtue and to the argument there is one among these cords which everyman ought to grasp and never let go but to pull with it against allthe rest and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason calledby us the common law of the state there are others which are hard andof iron but this one is soft because golden and there are severalother kinds now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of thebest which is law for inasmuch as reason is beautiful and not violent her rule must needs have ministers in order to helpthe golden principle in vanquishing the other principles and thus themoral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost andthe meaning of the expression superior or inferior to a become clearer and the individual attaining to right reasonin this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet should liveaccording to its rule while the city receiving the same from somegod or from one who has knowledge of these things should embody it ina law to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with otherstates in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguishedby us and when they have become clearer education and otherinstitutions will in like manner become clearer and in particularthat question of convivial entertainment which may seem have been a very trifling matter and to have taken a great manymore words than were necessary 
 cle perhaps however the theme may turn out not to be unworthyof the length of discourse 
 ath very good let us proceed with any enquiry which really bearson our present object 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we give this puppet of ours will be theeffect on him 
 cle having what in view do you ask that question 
 ath nothing as yet but i ask generally when the puppet is broughtto the drink what sort of result is likely to follow i willendeavour to explain my meaning more clearly what i am now askingis the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasuresand pains and passions and loves 
 cle very greatly 
 ath and are perception and memory and opinion and and increased do not these qualities entirely desert a manif he becomes saturated with drink 
 cle yes they entirely desert him 
 ath does he not return to the state of soul in which he was whena young child 
 cle he does 
 ath then at that time he will have the least control over himself 
 cle the least 
 ath and will he not be in a most wretched plight 
 cle most wretched 
 ath then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a secondtime a child 
 cle well said stranger 
 ath is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought toencourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can toavoid it 
 cle i suppose that there is you at any rate were just nowsaying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine 
 ath true i was and i am ready still seeing that you have bothdeclared that you are anxious to hear me 
 cle to sure we are if only for the strangeness of the asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge intoutter degradation 
 ath are you speaking of the soul 
 cle yes 
 ath and what would you say about the body my friend are you notsurprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himselfdeformity leanness ugliness decrepitude 
 cle certainly 
 ath yet when a man goes of his own accord to a shop andtakes medicine is he not aware that soon and for many daysafterwards he will be in a state of body which he would die ratherthan accept as the permanent condition of his life are not thosewho train in gymnasia at first beginning reduced to a state ofweakness 
 cle yes all that is well known 
 ath also that they go of their own accord for the sake of thesubsequent benefit 
 cle very good 
 ath and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of otherpractices 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows 
 cle to be sure 
 ath if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantageequal in importance to that of gymnastic they are in their verynature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise inasmuch as theyhave no accompaniment of pain 
 cle true but i hardly think that we shall be able to discoverany such benefits to be derived from them 
 ath that is just what we must endeavour to show and let me ask youa we not distinguish two kinds of fear which are verydifferent 
 cle what are they 
 ath there is the fear of expected evil 
 cle yes 
 ath and there is the fear of an evil reputation we are afraidof being thought evil because we do or say some dishonourablething which fear we and all men term shame 
 cle certainly 
 ath these are the two fears as i called them one of which isthe opposite of pain and other fears and the opposite also of thegreatest and most numerous sort of pleasures 
 cle very true 
 ath and does not the legislator and every one who is good foranything hold this fear in the greatest honour this is what he termsreverence and the confidence which is the reverse of this he termsinsolence and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil bothto individuals and to states 
 cle true 
 ath does not this kind of fear preserve us in many importantways what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in there are two things which give before fear of disgrace before friends 
 cle there are 
 ath then each of us should be fearless and also fearful and why weshould be either has now been determined 
 cle certainly 
 ath and when we want to make any one fearless we and the law bringhim face to face with many fears 
 cle clearly 
 ath and when we want to make him rightly fearful must we notintroduce him to shameless pleasures and train him to take up armsagainst them and to overcome them or does this principle apply tocourage only and must he who would be perfect in valour fight againstand overcome his own natural if he be unpractisedand inexperienced in such conflicts he will not be half the man whichhe might have are we to suppose that with temperance it isotherwise and that he who has never fought with the shameless andunrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts and conqueredthem in earnest and in play by word deed and act will still beperfectly temperate 
 cle a most unlikely supposition 
 ath suppose that some god had given a to men andthat the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself atevery draught as a child of misfortune and that he fearedeverything happening or about to happen to him and that at last themost courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a only came to himself again when he had slept off the influenceof the draught 
 cle but has such a draught stranger ever really been knownamong men 
 ath no but if there had been might not such a draught havebeen of use to the legislator as a test of courage might we not goand say to him o legislator whether you are legislating for thecretan or for any other state would you not like to have atouchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens 
 cle i should will be the answer of every one 
 ath and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is norisk and no great danger than the reverse 
 cle in that proposition every one may safely agree 
 ath and in order to make use of the draught you would lead themamid these imaginary terrors and prove them when the affection offear was working upon them and compel them to be and admonishing them and also honouring them butdishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in allrespects such as you command him and if he underwent the trial welland manfully you would let him go unscathed but if ill you wouldinflict a punishment upon him or would you abstain from using thepotion altogether although you have no reason for abstaining 
 cle he would be certain stranger to use the potion 
 ath this would be a mode of testing and training which would bewonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use and might beapplied to a single person or to a few or indeed to any he would do well who provided himself with the potion only ratherthan with any number of other things whether he preferred to be byhimself in solitude and there contend with his fears because hewas ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect ortrusting to the force of his own nature and habits and believing thathe had been already disciplined sufficiently he did not hesitate totrain himself in company with any number of others and display hispower in conquering the irresistible change effected by virtue being such that he never in any instance fell intoany great unseemliness but was always himself and left off before hearrived at the last cup fearing that he like all other men might beovercome by the potion 
 cle yes stranger in that last case too he might equally showhis 
 ath let us return to the lawgiver and say to is certainly no such which man has either receivedfrom the gods or himself discovered for witchcraft has no place atour board but is there any potion which might serve as a test ofoverboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting 
 cle i suppose that he will say that wine is such apotion 
 ath is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect ofthe other when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleasedwith himself and the more he drinks the more he is filled full ofbrave hopes and conceit of his power and at last the string of histongue is loosened and fancying himself wise he is brimming overwith lawlessness and has no more fear or respect and is ready todo or say anything 
 cle i think that every one will admit the truth of yourdescription 
 meg certainly 
 ath now let us remember as we were saying that there are twothings which should be cultivated in the soul first the greatestcourage secondly the greatest fear 
 cle which you said to be characteristic of reverence if i am notmistaken 
 ath thank you for reminding me but now as the habit of courageand fearlessness is to be trained amid fears let us considerwhether the opposite quality is not also to be trained amongopposites 
 cle that is probably the case 
 ath there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more thancommonly valiant and bold now we ought to train ourselves on theseoccasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness aspossible and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that isbase 
 cle true 
 ath are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold andshameless such as we are under the influence of pride ignorance avarice cowardice or when wealth and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden is better adapted than the festive use of wine in the firstplace to test and in the second place to train the character of aman if care be taken in the use of it what is there cheaper or moreinnocent for do but consider which is the greater yourather test a man of a morose and savage nature which is the sourceof ten thousand acts of injustice by making bargains with him at arisk to yourself or by having him as a companion at the festival ofdionysus or would you if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a manwho is prone to love entrust your wife or your sons or daughters tohim perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of thecondition of his soul i might mention numberless cases in whichthe advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character insport and without paying dearly for experience and i do notbelieve that either a cretan or any other man will doubt that such atest is a fair test and safer cheaper and speedier than any other 
 cle that is certainly true 
 ath and this knowledge of the natures and habits of soulswill be of the greatest use in that art which has the management ofthem and that art if i am not mistaken is politics 
 cle exactly so

 book ii 
 
 athenian stranger and now we have to consider whether the insightinto human nature is the only benefit derived from well orderedpotations or whether there are not other advantages great and much tobe desired the argument seems to imply that there are but how and inwhat way these are to be attained will have to be consideredattentively or we may be entangled in error 
 cleinias proceed 
 ath let me once more recall our doctrine of right education i am not mistaken depends on the due regulation of convivialintercourse 
 cle you talk rather grandly 
 ath pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions ofchildren and i say that they are the forms under which virtue andvice are originally present to them as to wisdom and true and fixedopinions happy is the man who acquires them even when declining inyears and we may say that he who possesses them and the blessingswhich are contained in them is a perfect man now i mean by educationthat training which is given by suitable habits to the first instinctsof virtue in pleasure and friendship and pain andhatred are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable ofunderstanding the nature of them and who find them after they haveattained reason to be in harmony with her this harmony of thesoul taken as a whole is virtue but the particular training inrespect of pleasure and pain which leads you always to hate whatyou ought to hate and love what you ought to love from thebeginning of life to the end may be separated off and in my be rightly called education 
 cle i think stranger that you are quite right in all that youhave said and are saying about education 
 ath i am glad to hear that you agree with me for indeed thediscipline of pleasure and pain which when rightly ordered is aprinciple of education has been often relaxed and corrupted inhuman life and the gods pitying the toils which our race is bornto undergo have appointed holy festivals wherein men alternaterest with labour and have given them the muses and apollo the leaderof the muses and dionysus to be companions in their revels thatthey may improve their education by taking part in the festivals ofthe gods and with their help i should like to know whether acommon saying is in our opinion true to nature or not for men saythat the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies orin their voices they are always wanting to move and cry out someleaping and skipping and overflowing with sportiveness and delight atsomething others uttering all sorts of cries but whereas theanimals have no perception of order or disorder in their is of rhythm or harmony as they are called to us the as we say have been appointed to be our companions in the given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm and so theystir us into life and we follow them joining hands together indances and songs and these they call choruses which is a termnaturally expressive of cheerfulness shall we begin then with theacknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and themuses what do you say 
 cle i assent 
 ath and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in thechorus and the educated is he who has been well trained 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the chorus is made up of two parts dance and song 
 cle true 
 ath then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dancewell 
 cle i suppose that he will 
 ath let us see what are we saying 
 cle what 
 ath he sings well and dances well now must we add that he singswhat is good and dances what is good 
 cle let us make the addition 
 ath we will suppose that he knows the good to be good and thebad to be bad and makes use of them accordingly which now is thebetter trained in dancing and who is able to move his bodyand to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner buthas no delight in good or hatred of evil or he who is incorrect ingesture and voice but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain andwelcomes what is good and is offended at what is evil 
 cle there is a great difference stranger in the two kinds ofeducation 
 ath if we three know what is good in song and dance then wetruly know also who is educated and who is uneducated but if we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard ofeducation and whether there is any or not 
 cle true 
 ath let us follow the scent like hounds and go in pursuit ofbeauty of figure and melody and song and dance if these escape will be no use in talking about true education whether hellenicor barbarian 
 cle yes 
 ath and what is beauty of figure or beautiful melody when a manlysoul is in trouble and when a cowardly soul is in similar case arethey likely to use the same figures and gestures or to give utteranceto the same sounds 
 cle how can they when the very colours of their faces differ 
 ath good my friend i may observe however in passing that inmusic there certainly are figures and there are melodies and music isconcerned with harmony and rhythm so that you may speak of a melodyor figure having good rhythm or good term is correctenough but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having colour as the masters of choruses do is not you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and thecoward praising the one and censuring the other and not to betedious let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressiveof virtue of soul or body or of images of virtue are withoutexception good and those which are expressive of vice are the reverseof good 
 cle your suggestion is excellent and let us answer that thesethings are so 
 ath once more are all of us equally delighted with every sort ofdance 
 cle far otherwise 
 ath what then leads us astray are beautiful things not thesame to us all or are they the same in themselves but not in ouropinion of them for no one will admit that forms of vice in the danceare more beautiful than forms of virtue or that he himself delightsin the forms of vice and others in a muse of another character andyet most persons say that the excellence of music is to give pleasureto our souls but this is intolerable and blasphemous there a much more plausible account of the delusion 
 cle what 
 ath the adaptation of art to the characters of men choricmovements are imitations of manners occurring in various particular is imitated and those towhom the words or songs or dances are suited either by nature orhabit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applaudingthem and calling them beautiful but those whose natures or ways orhabits are unsuited to them cannot delight in them or applaud they call them base there are others again whose natures areright and their habits wrong or whose habits are right and theirnatures wrong and they praise one thing but are pleased atanother for they say that all these imitations are pleasant butnot good and in the presence of those whom they think wise theyare ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner or ofdeliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings and have a secret pleasure in them 
 cle very true 
 ath and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure 
 cle i think that there is 
 ath i think is not the word but i would say rather i amcertain for must they not have the same effect as when a manassociates with bad characters whom he likes and approves rather thandislikes and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion ofhis own badness in that case he who takes pleasure in them willsurely become like those in whom he takes pleasure even though hebe ashamed to praise them and what greater good or evil can anydestiny ever make us undergo 
 cle i know of none 
 ath then in a city which has good laws or in future ages is tohave them bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which aregiven by music can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed toteach in the dance anything which they themselves like in the wayof rhythm or melody or words to the young children of parents is the poet to train his choruses as hepleases without reference to virtue or vice 
 cle that is surely quite unreasonable and is not to be thought of 
 ath and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exceptionof egypt 
 cle and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt 
 ath you will wonder when i tell you long ago they appear to haverecognized the very principle of which we are now young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains ofvirtue these they fixed and exhibited the patterns of them intheir temples and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate uponthem or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones to thisday no alteration is allowed either in these arts or in music atall and you will find that their works of art are painted ormoulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand is literally true and no ancientpaintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than thework of but are made with just the same skill 
 cle how extraordinary 
 ath i should rather say how statesmanlike how worthy of alegislator i know that other things in egypt are nat so well butwhat i am telling you about music is true and deserving ofconsideration because showing that a lawgiver may institutemelodies which have a natural truth and correctness without any fearof failure to do this however must be the work of god or of adivine person in egypt they have a tradition that their ancientchants which have been preserved for so many ages are thecomposition of the goddess isis and therefore as i was saying ifa person can only find in any way the natural melodies he mayconfidently embody them in a fixed and legal form for the love ofnovelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of theold has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song anddance under the plea that they have become antiquated at any are far from being corrupted in egypt 
 cle your arguments seem to prove your point 
 ath may we not confidently say that the true use of music and ofchoral festivities is as follows we rejoice when we think that weprosper and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice 
 cle exactly 
 ath and when rejoicing in our good fortune we are unable to bestill 
 cle true 
 ath our young men break forth into dancing and singing and wewho are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life whenwe look on at them having lost our agility we delight in theirsports and because we love to think of our formerselves and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awakenin us the memory of our youth 
 cle very true 
 ath is it altogether unmeaning to say as the common people doabout festivals that he should be adjudged the wisest of men and thewinner of the palm who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure andmirth for on such occasions and when mirth is the order of theday ought not he to be honoured most and as i was saying bearthe palm who gives most mirth to the greatest number now is this atrue way of speaking or of acting 
 cle possibly 
 ath but my dear friend let us distinguish between differentcases and not be hasty in forming a judgment one way ofconsidering the question will be to imagine a festival at whichthere are entertainments of all sorts including gymnastic equestrian contests the citizens are assembled prizes areoffered and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter thelists and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasureto the is to be no regulation about the manner he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crownedvictor and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates what islikely to be the result of such a proclamation 
 cle in what respect 
 ath there would be various exhibitions one man like homer willexhibit a rhapsody another a performance on the lute one will have atragedy and another a comedy nor would there be anything astonishingin some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting suppose these competitors to meet and not these innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be thevictor 
 cle i do not see how any one can answer you or pretend to he has heard with his own ears the several competitors thequestion is absurd 
 ath well then if neither of you can answer shall i answer thisquestion which you deem so absurd 
 cle by all means 
 ath if very small children are to determine the question they willdecide for the puppet show 
 cle of course 
 ath the older children will be advocates of comedy educated young men and people in general will favour tragedy 
 cle very likely 
 ath and i believe that we old men would have the greatestpleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey orone of the hesiodic poems and would award the victory to him would really be the is the question 
 cle yes 
 ath clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we oldmen adjudge victors ought to win for our ways are far and away betterthan any which at present exist anywhere in the world 
 cle certainly 
 ath thus far i too should agree with the many that theexcellence of music is to be measured by pleasure but the pleasuremust not be that of chance persons the fairest music is that whichdelights the best and best educated and especially that whichdelights the one man who is in virtue and education andtherefore the judges must be men of character for they will requireboth wisdom and courage the true judge must not draw hisinspiration from the theatre nor ought he to be unnerved by theclamour of the many and his own incapacity nor again knowing thetruth ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly todeliver a lying judgment with the very same lips which have justappealed to the gods before he judged he is sitting not as thedisciple of the theatre but in his proper place as theirinstructor and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to thepleasure of the spectators the ancient and common custom of still prevails in italy and sicily did certainly leave thejudgment to the body of spectators who determined the victor byshow of hands but this custom has been the destruction of thepoets for they are now in the habit of composing with a view toplease the bad taste of their judges and the result is that thespectators instruct also it has been the ruin of thetheatre they ought to be having characters put before them betterthan their own and so receiving a higher pleasure but now by theirown act the opposite result follows what inference is to be drawnfrom all this shall i tell you 
 cle what 
 ath the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth timeis that education is the constraining and directing of youthtowards that right reason which the law affirms and which theexperience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right inorder then that the soul of the child may not be habituated tofeel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law and thosewho obey the law but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrowat the same things as the order i say to produce thiseffect chants appear to have been invented which really enchant andare designed to implant that harmony of which we speak and becausethe mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious are called plays and songs and are performed in play just aswhen men are sick and ailing in their bodies their attendants givethem wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks but unwholesome dietin disagreeable things in order that they may learn as they like the one and to dislike the other and similarly the truelegislator will persuade and if he cannot persuade will compelthe poet to express as he ought by fair and noble words in hisrhythms the figures and in his melodies the music of temperateand brave and in every way good men 
 cle but do you really imagine stranger that this is the way inwhich poets generally compose in states at the present day as faras i can observe except among us and among the are no regulations like those of which you speak in otherplaces novelties are always being introduced in dancing and inmusic generally not under the authority of any law but at theinstigation of lawless pleasures and these pleasures are so farfrom being the same as you describe the egyptian to be or having thesame principles that they are never the same 
 ath most true cleinias and i daresay that i may have expressedmyself obscurely and so led you to imagine that i was speaking ofsome really existing state of things whereas i was only saying whatregulations i would like to have about music and hence there occurreda misapprehension on your part for when evils are far gone andirremediable the task of censuring them is never pleasant althoughat times necessary but as we do not really differ will you let meask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalentamong the cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes 
 cle certainly they are 
 ath and if they were extended to the other hellenes would it be animprovement on the present state of things 
 cle a very great improvement if the customs which prevail amongthem were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians and such asyou were just now saying ought to prevail 
 ath let us see whether we understand one not theprinciples of education and music which prevail among you asfollows you compel your poets to say that the good man if he betemperate and just is fortunate and happy and this whether he begreat and strong or small and weak and whether he be rich or on the other hand if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras ormidas and be unjust he is wretched and lives in misery as thepoet says and with truth i sing not i care not about him whoaccomplishes all noble things not having justice let him near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a justman but if he be unjust i would not have him look calmly uponbloody death nor surpass in swiftness the thracian boreas and letno other thing that is called good ever be his for the goods of whichthe many speak are not really good first in the catalogue is placedhealth beauty next wealth third and then innumerable others as forexample to have a keen eye or a quick ear and in general to haveall the senses perfect or again to be a tyrant and do as youlike and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquiredall these things and when you have acquired them to become at onceimmortal but you and i say that while to the just and holy all thesethings are the best of possessions to the unjust they are even health the greatest of evils for in truth to havesight and hearing and the use of the senses or to live at allwithout justice and virtue even though a man be rich in all goods of fortune is the greatest of evils if life beimmortal but not so great if the bad man lives only a very shorttime these are the truths which if i am not mistaken you willpersuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments ofharmony and rhythm and in these they must train up your youth am inot right for i plainly declare that evils as they are termed aregoods to the unjust and only evils to the just and that goods aretruly good to the good but evil to the evil let me ask again areyou and i agreed about this 
 cle i think that we partly agree and partly do not 
 ath when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts andwhen he is preeminent in strength and courage and has the gift ofimmortality and none of the evils which goods but only the injustice and insolence of his own an one you are i suspect unwilling to believe that he ismiserable rather than happy 
 cle that is quite true 
 ath once more suppose that he be valiant and strong andhandsome and rich and does throughout his whole life whatever helikes still if he be unrighteous and insolent would not both of youagree that he will of necessity live basely you will surely grantso much 
 cle certainly 
 ath and an evil life too 
 cle i am not equally disposed to grant that 
 ath will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage 
 cle how can i possibly say so 
 ath how then may heaven make us to be of one mind for now weare of two to me dear cleinias the truth of what i am saying isas plain as the fact that crete is an island and if i were alawgiver i would try to make the poets and all the citizens speakin this strain and i would inflict the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad menwho lead pleasant lives or that the profitable and gainful is onething and the just another and there are many other matters aboutwhich i should make my citizens speak in a manner different from thecretans and lacedaemonians of this age and i may say indeed fromthe world in general for tell me my good friends by zeus and apollotell me if i were to ask these same gods who were your the most just life also the pleasantest or are there two of which is the justest and the other the theywere to reply that there are two and thereupon i proceeded to would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry which are who lead the justest or those who lead thepleasantest life and they replied those who lead would be a very strange answer which i should notlike to put into the mouth of the gods the words will come withmore propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators and thereforei will repeat my former questions to one of them and suppose him tosay again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the to that i my father did you not wish me to live ashappily as possible and yet you also never ceased telling me that ishould live as justly as possible now here the giver of the he be legislator or father will be in a dilemma and willin vain endeavour to be consistent with himself but if he were todeclare that the justest life is also the happiest every onehearing him would enquire if i am not mistaken what is that good andnoble principle in life which the law approves and which issuperior to pleasure for what good can the just man have which isseparated from pleasure shall we say that glory and fame coming fromgods and men though good and noble are nevertheless infamy pleasant certainly not sweet legislator or shall wesay that the of wrong and there being no wrong done isgood and honourable although there is no pleasure in it and that thedoing wrong is pleasant but evil and base 
 cle impossible 
 ath the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and thejust and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religioustendency and the opposite view is most at variance with the designsof the legislator and is in his opinion infamous for no one if hecan help will be persuaded to do that which gives him more painthan pleasure but as distant prospects are apt to make us in childhood the legislator will try to purge away thedarkness and exhibit the truth he will persuade the citizens in someway or other by customs and praises and words that just and unjustare shadows only and that injustice which seems opposed tojustice when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasantand the just most unpleasant but that from the just point ofview the very opposite is the appearance of both of them 
 cle true 
 ath and which may be supposed to be the truer ofthe inferior or of the better soul 
 cle surely that of the better soul 
 ath then the unjust life must not only be more base and also more unpleasant than the just and holy life 
 cle that seems to be implied in the present argument 
 ath and even supposing this were otherwise and not as the argumenthas proven still the lawgiver who is worth anything if he everventures to tell a lie to the young for their good could not invent amore useful lie than this or one which will have a better effect inmaking them do what is right not on compulsion but voluntarily 
 cle truth stranger is a noble thing and a lasting but a thing ofwhich men are hard to be persuaded 
 ath and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus which is soimprobable has been readily believed and also innumerable othertales 
 cle what is that story 
 ath the story of armed men springing up after the sowing ofteeth which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuadethe minds of the young of anything so that he has only to reflect andfind out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage andthen use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and thesame word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life if you do not agree with me there is no reason why you should notargue on the other side 
 cle i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by eitherof us against what you are now saying 
 ath the next suggestion which i have to offer is that all ourthree choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we havealready spoken or are about to speak and the sum of them shall the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is alsothe shall affirm this to be a most certain truth and theminds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive thesewords of ours than any others which we might address to them 
 cle i assent to what you say 
 ath first will enter in their natural order the sacred choircomposed of children which is to sing lustily the layto the whole city next will follow the choir of young men under theage of thirty who will call upon the god paean to testify to thetruth of their words and will pray him to be gracious to the youthand to turn their hearts thirdly the choir of elder men who arefrom thirty to sixty years of age will also sing there remainthose who are too old to sing and they will tell the same virtues as with the voice of an oracle 
 cle who are those who compose the third choir stranger for i donot clearly understand what you mean to say about them 
 ath and yet almost all that i have been saying has said with a viewto them 
 cle will you try to be a little plainer 
 ath i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse as youwill remember of the fiery nature of young creatures i said thatthey were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice and thatthey called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner and that noother animal attained to any perception of order but man only nowthe order of motion is called rhythm and the order of the voice inwhich high and low are duly mingled is called harmony and bothtogether are termed choric song and i said that the gods had pityon us and gave us apollo and the muses to be our playfellows andleaders in the dance and dionysus as i dare say that you willremember was the third 
 cle i quite remember 
 ath thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the i have still to speak of the remaining chorus which is that ofdionysus 
 cle how is that arranged there is something strange at any rateon first hearing in a dionysiac chorus of old men if you really meanthat those who are above thirty and may be fifty or from fifty tosixty years of age are to dance in his honour 
 ath very true and therefore it must be shown that there is goodreason for the proposal 
 cle certainly 
 ath are we agreed thus far 
 cle about what 
 ath that every man and boy slave and free both sexes and thewhole city should never cease charming themselves with the strains ofwhich we have spoken and that there should be every sort of changeand variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness sothat the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns and maynever weary of them 
 cle every one will agree 
 ath where then will that best part of our city which by reasonof age and intelligence has the greatest influence sing thesefairest of strains which are to do so much good shall we be sofoolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful andalso the most useful of songs 
 cle but says the argument we cannot let them off 
 ath then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum will thisbe the way 
 cle what 
 ath when a man is advancing in years he is afraid and reluctant has no pleasure in his own performances and if compulsion isused he will be more and more ashamed the older and more discreet not this true 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand upand sing in the theatre to a mixed if moreover when heis required to do so like the other choirs who contend for have been trained under a singing master he is pinched andhungry he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort whichwill make him very unwilling to exhibit 
 cle no doubt 
 ath how then shall we reassure him and get him to sing shall webegin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they areeighteen years of age we will tell them that fire must not bepoured upon fire whether in the body or in the soul until they beginto go to is a precaution which has to be taken against theexcitableness of they may taste wine in moderationup to the age of thirty but while a man is young he should abstainaltogether from intoxication and from excess of wine when at has reached forty years after dinner at a public mess he mayinvite not only the other gods but dionysus above all to the mysteryand festivity of the elder men making use of the wine which he hasgiven men to lighten the sourness of old age that in age we may renewour youth and forget our sorrows and also in order that the natureof the soul like iron melted in the fire may become softer and somore impressible in the first place will not any one who is thusmellowed be more ready and less ashamed to do not say beforea large audience but before a moderate company nor yet amongstrangers but among his familiars and as we have often said tochant and to enchant 
 cle he will be far more ready 
 ath there will be no impropriety in our using such a method ofpersuading them to join with us in song 
 cle none at all 
 ath and what strain will they sing and what muse will they strain should clearly be one suitable to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what strain is suitable for heroes shall they sing achoric strain 
 cle truly stranger we of crete and lacedaemon know no strainother than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing inour chorus 
 ath i dare say for you have never acquired the knowledge of themost beautiful kind of song in your military way of life which ismodelled after the camp and is not like that of dwellers in you have your young men herding and feeding together like youngcolts no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away fromhis fellows against his will raging and foaming and gives him agroom to attend to him alone and trains and rubs him downprivately and gives him the qualities in education which will makehim not only a good soldier but also a governor of a state and ofcities such an one as we said at first would be a greater warriorthan he of whom tyrtaeus sings and he would honour courageeverywhere but always as the fourth and not as the first part ofvirtue either in individuals or states 
 cle once more stranger i must complain that you depreciate ourlawgivers 
 ath not intentionally if at all my good friend but whither theargument leads thither let us follow for if there be indeed somestrain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or thepublic theatres i should like to impart it to those who as we ashamed of these and want to have the best 
 cle certainly 
 ath when things have an accompanying charm either the best thingin them is this very charm or there is some rightness or utilitypossessed by example i should say that eating and the use of food in general have an accompanying charm which wecall pleasure but that this rightness and utility is just thehealthfulness of the things served up to us which is their truerightness 
 cle just so 
 ath thus too i should say that learning has a certainaccompanying charm which is the pleasure but that the right and theprofitable the good and the noble are qualities which the truthgives to it 
 cle exactly 
 ath and so in the imitative they succeed in makinglikenesses and are accompanied by pleasure may not their works besaid to have a charm 
 cle yes 
 ath but equal proportions whether of quality or quantity andnot pleasure speaking generally would give them truth or rightness 
 cle yes 
 ath then that only can be rightly judged by the standard ofpleasure which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality but existssolely for the sake of the accompanying charm and the term most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities areabsent 
 cle you are speaking of harmless pleasure are you not 
 ath yes and this i term amusement when doing neither harm norgood in any degree worth speaking of 
 cle very true 
 ath then if such be our principles we must assert thatimitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion andthis is true of all equality for the equal is not equal or thesymmetrical symmetrical because somebody thinks or likes they are to be judged of by the standard of truth and by no otherwhatever 
 cle quite true 
 ath do we not regard all music as representative and imitative 
 cle certainly 
 ath then when any one says that music is to be judged of bypleasure his doctrine cannot be admitted and if there be any musicof which pleasure is the criterion such music is not to be sought outor deemed to have any real excellence but only that other kind ofmusic which is an imitation of the good 
 cle very true 
 ath and those who seek for the best kind of song and music oughtnot to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is the truth of imitation consists as we were saying in renderingthe thing imitated according to quantity and quality 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every one will admit that musical compositions are allimitative and representative will not poets and spectators and actorsall agree in this 
 cle they will 
 ath surely then he who would judge correctly must know what eachcomposition is for if he does not know what is the character andmeaning of the piece and what it represents he will never discernwhether the intention is true or false 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and will he who does not know what is true be able todistinguish what is good and bad my statement is not very perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter inanother way 
 cle how 
 ath there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight 
 cle yes 
 ath and can he who does not know what the exact object is whichis imitated ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully mean for example whether a statue has the proportions of a the true situation of the parts what those proportions are andhow the parts fit into one another in due order also their coloursand conformations or whether this is all confused in the you think that any one can know about this who does not knowwhat the animal is which has been imitated 
 cle impossible 
 ath but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured isa man who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper partsand colours and shapes must we not also know whether the work isbeautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty 
 cle if this were not required stranger we should all of us bejudges of beauty 
 ath very true and may we not say that in everything in drawing music or any other art he who is to be acompetent judge must possess three must know in thefirst place of what the imitation is secondly he must know thatit is true and thirdly that it has been well executed in words andmelodies and rhythms 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficultyof music music is more celebrated than any other kind of therefore requires the greatest care of them all for if a manmakes a mistake here he may do himself the greatest injury bywelcoming evil dispositions and the mistake may be very difficultto discern because the poets are artists very inferior in characterto the muses themselves who would never fall into the monstrous errorof assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen wouldthey add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort with the rhythms and gestures of freemen would theyassign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of menand instruments and every other sort of noise as if they were allone but human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistentmixture and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those orpheus says are ripe for true pleasure the experienced see allthis confusion and yet the poets go on and make still further havocby separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from themelody setting bare words to metre and also separating the melodyand the rhythm from the words using the lyre or the flute when there are no words it is very difficult to recognize themeaning of the harmony and rhythm or to see that any worthy object isimitated by them and we must acknowledge that all this sort of aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise anduses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of thedance and song is exceedingly coarse and tasteless the use of eitherinstrument when unaccompanied leads to every sort of irregularityand trickery this is all rational enough but we are consideringnot how our choristers who are from thirty to fifty years of age andmay be over fifty are not to use the muses but how they are to usethem and the considerations which we have urged seem to show inwhat way these fifty choristers who are to sing may beexpected to be better trained for they need to have a quickperception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms otherwise howcan they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to thedorian mode or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it 
 cle clearly they cannot 
 ath the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what isin proper harmony and rhythm and what is not when they can only bemade to sing and step in rhythm by force it never occurs to them thatthey are ignorant of what they are doing now every melody is rightwhen it has suitable harmony and rhythm and wrong when unsuitable 
 cle that is most certain 
 ath but can a man who does not know a thing as we were that the thing is right 
 cle impossible 
 ath then now as would appear we are making the discovery that choristers whom we hereby invite and although theyare their own masters compel to sing must be educated to such anextent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notesof the song that they may know the harmonies and rhythms and be ableto select what are suitable for men of their age and character tosing and may sing them and have innocent pleasure from their ownperformance and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delightgood dispositions having such training they will attain a moreaccurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people or evenof the poets themselves for the poet need not know the third whether the imitation is good or not though he can hardlyhelp knowing the laws of melody and rhythm but the aged chorus mustknow all the three that they may choose the best and that which isnearest to the best for otherwise they will never be able to charmthe souls of young men in the way of virtue and now the originaldesign of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to thechorus of dionysus has been accomplished to the best of ourability and let us see whether we were should imagine that adrinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous asthe drinking goes on this as we were saying at first will certainlybe the case 
 cle certainly 
 ath every man has a more than natural elevation his heart isglad within him and he will say anything and will be restrained bynobody at such a time he fancies that he is able to rule over himselfand all mankind 
 cle quite true 
 ath were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of thedrinkers become like iron heated in the fire and grow softer andyounger and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate andfashion them just as when they were young and that this fashioner ofthem is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their the good legislator and that he ought to enact laws of thebanquet which when a man is confident bold and impudent andunwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and drinking and music will change his character into laws as will infuse into him a just and noble will take up arms at the approach of insolence being thatdivine fear which we have called reverence and shame 
 cle true 
 ath and the guardians of these laws and with themare the calm and sober generals of the drinkers and without theirhelp there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than infighting against enemies when the commander of an army is nothimself calm and he who is unwilling to obey them and thecommanders of dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys militaryleaders or even greater 
 cle right 
 ath if then drinking and amusement were regulated in this not the companions of our revels be improved they would partbetter friends than they were and not as now enemies their wholeintercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it and thesober would be the leaders of the drunken 
 cle i think so too if drinking were regulated as you propose 
 ath let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as badand unfit to be received into the state for wine has manyexcellences and one one about which there is adifficulty in speaking to the many from a fear of their misconceivingand misunderstanding what is said 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath there is a tradition or story which has somehow crept aboutthe world that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmotherhere and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancingmadnesses in others for which reason he gave men wine suchtraditions concerning the gods i leave to those who think that theymay be safely uttered i only know that no animal at birth is matureor perfect in intelligence and in the intermediate period in whichhe has not yet acquired his own proper sense he rages and roarswithout rhyme or reason and when he has once got on his legs he jumpsabout without rhyme or reason and this as you will remember hasbeen already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic 
 cle to be sure i remember 
 ath and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythmsprang from this beginning among men and that apollo and the musesand dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them 
 cle certainly 
 ath the other story implied that wine was given man out of in order to make him mad but our present doctrine on thecontrary is that wine was given him as a balm and in order toimplant modesty in the soul and health and strength in the body 
 cle that stranger is precisely what was said 
 ath then half the subject may now be considered to have beendiscussed shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half 
 cle what is the other half and how do you divide the subject 
 ath the whole choral art is also in our view the whole ofeducation and of this art rhythms and harmonies form the partwhich has to do with the voice 
 cle yes 
 ath the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movementof the voice but gesture is peculiar to it whereas song is simplythe movement of the voice 
 cle most true 
 ath and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the have ventured to term music 
 cle we were right 
 ath and the movement of the body when regarded as an amusement wetermed dancing but when extended and pursued with a view to theexcellence of the body this scientific training may be calledgymnastic 
 cle exactly 
 ath music which was one half of the choral art may be said tohave been completely discussed shall we proceed to the other halfor not what would you like 
 cle my good friend when you are talking with a cretan andlacedaemonian and we have discussed music and not gymnastic whatanswer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry 
 ath an answer is contained in your question and i understand andaccept what you say not only as an answer but also as a command toproceed with gymnastic 
 cle you quite understand me do as you say 
 ath i will and there will not be any difficulty in speakingintelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are farmore familiar than with music 
 cle there will not 
 ath is not the origin of gymnastics too to be sought in thetendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals man as wewere saying having attained the sense of rhythm created and inventeddancing and melody arousing and awakening rhythm both unitedformed the choral art 
 cle very true 
 ath and one part of this subject has been already discussed byus and there still remains another to be discussed 
 cle exactly 
 ath i have first a final word to add to my discourse about you will allow me to do so 
 cle what more have you to say 
 ath i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt thepractice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to theenforcement of temperance and in like manner and on the sameprinciple will allow of other pleasures designing to gain thevictory over them in this way all of them may be used but if thestate makes drinking an amusement only and whoever likes may drinkwhenever he likes and with whom he likes and add to this any otherindulgences i shall never agree or allow that this city or this manshould practise drinking i would go further than the cretans andlacedaemonians and am disposed rather to the law of thecarthaginians that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowedto taste wine at all but that he should drink water during all thattime and that in the city no slave male or female should ever drinkwine and that no magistrates should drink during their year ofoffice nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty tastewine at all nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about anymatter of importance nor in the daytime at all unless in consequenceof exercise or as medicine nor again at night when any one eitherman or woman is minded to get children there are numberless othercases also in which those who have good sense and good laws oughtnot to drink wine so that if what i say is true no city will needmany vineyards their husbandry and their way of life in generalwill follow an appointed order and their cultivation of the vine willbe the most limited and the least common of their employments andthis stranger shall be the crown of my discourse about wine ifyou agree 
 cle excellent we agree

 book ii 
 
 athenian stranger and now we have to consider whether the insightinto human nature is the only benefit derived from well orderedpotations or whether there are not other advantages great and much tobe desired the argument seems to imply that there are but how and inwhat way these are to be attained will have to be consideredattentively or we may be entangled in error 
 cleinias proceed 
 ath let me once more recall our doctrine of right education i am not mistaken depends on the due regulation of convivialintercourse 
 cle you talk rather grandly 
 ath pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions ofchildren and i say that they are the forms under which virtue andvice are originally present to them as to wisdom and true and fixedopinions happy is the man who acquires them even when declining inyears and we may say that he who possesses them and the blessingswhich are contained in them is a perfect man now i mean by educationthat training which is given by suitable habits to the first instinctsof virtue in pleasure and friendship and pain andhatred are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable ofunderstanding the nature of them and who find them after they haveattained reason to be in harmony with her this harmony of thesoul taken as a whole is virtue but the particular training inrespect of pleasure and pain which leads you always to hate whatyou ought to hate and love what you ought to love from thebeginning of life to the end may be separated off and in my be rightly called education 
 cle i think stranger that you are quite right in all that youhave said and are saying about education 
 ath i am glad to hear that you agree with me for indeed thediscipline of pleasure and pain which when rightly ordered is aprinciple of education has been often relaxed and corrupted inhuman life and the gods pitying the toils which our race is bornto undergo have appointed holy festivals wherein men alternaterest with labour and have given them the muses and apollo the leaderof the muses and dionysus to be companions in their revels thatthey may improve their education by taking part in the festivals ofthe gods and with their help i should like to know whether acommon saying is in our opinion true to nature or not for men saythat the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies orin their voices they are always wanting to move and cry out someleaping and skipping and overflowing with sportiveness and delight atsomething others uttering all sorts of cries but whereas theanimals have no perception of order or disorder in their is of rhythm or harmony as they are called to us the as we say have been appointed to be our companions in the given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm and so theystir us into life and we follow them joining hands together indances and songs and these they call choruses which is a termnaturally expressive of cheerfulness shall we begin then with theacknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and themuses what do you say 
 cle i assent 
 ath and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in thechorus and the educated is he who has been well trained 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the chorus is made up of two parts dance and song 
 cle true 
 ath then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dancewell 
 cle i suppose that he will 
 ath let us see what are we saying 
 cle what 
 ath he sings well and dances well now must we add that he singswhat is good and dances what is good 
 cle let us make the addition 
 ath we will suppose that he knows the good to be good and thebad to be bad and makes use of them accordingly which now is thebetter trained in dancing and who is able to move his bodyand to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner buthas no delight in good or hatred of evil or he who is incorrect ingesture and voice but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain andwelcomes what is good and is offended at what is evil 
 cle there is a great difference stranger in the two kinds ofeducation 
 ath if we three know what is good in song and dance then wetruly know also who is educated and who is uneducated but if we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard ofeducation and whether there is any or not 
 cle true 
 ath let us follow the scent like hounds and go in pursuit ofbeauty of figure and melody and song and dance if these escape will be no use in talking about true education whether hellenicor barbarian 
 cle yes 
 ath and what is beauty of figure or beautiful melody when a manlysoul is in trouble and when a cowardly soul is in similar case arethey likely to use the same figures and gestures or to give utteranceto the same sounds 
 cle how can they when the very colours of their faces differ 
 ath good my friend i may observe however in passing that inmusic there certainly are figures and there are melodies and music isconcerned with harmony and rhythm so that you may speak of a melodyor figure having good rhythm or good term is correctenough but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having colour as the masters of choruses do is not you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and thecoward praising the one and censuring the other and not to betedious let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressiveof virtue of soul or body or of images of virtue are withoutexception good and those which are expressive of vice are the reverseof good 
 cle your suggestion is excellent and let us answer that thesethings are so 
 ath once more are all of us equally delighted with every sort ofdance 
 cle far otherwise 
 ath what then leads us astray are beautiful things not thesame to us all or are they the same in themselves but not in ouropinion of them for no one will admit that forms of vice in the danceare more beautiful than forms of virtue or that he himself delightsin the forms of vice and others in a muse of another character andyet most persons say that the excellence of music is to give pleasureto our souls but this is intolerable and blasphemous there a much more plausible account of the delusion 
 cle what 
 ath the adaptation of art to the characters of men choricmovements are imitations of manners occurring in various particular is imitated and those towhom the words or songs or dances are suited either by nature orhabit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applaudingthem and calling them beautiful but those whose natures or ways orhabits are unsuited to them cannot delight in them or applaud they call them base there are others again whose natures areright and their habits wrong or whose habits are right and theirnatures wrong and they praise one thing but are pleased atanother for they say that all these imitations are pleasant butnot good and in the presence of those whom they think wise theyare ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner or ofdeliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings and have a secret pleasure in them 
 cle very true 
 ath and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure 
 cle i think that there is 
 ath i think is not the word but i would say rather i amcertain for must they not have the same effect as when a manassociates with bad characters whom he likes and approves rather thandislikes and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion ofhis own badness in that case he who takes pleasure in them willsurely become like those in whom he takes pleasure even though hebe ashamed to praise them and what greater good or evil can anydestiny ever make us undergo 
 cle i know of none 
 ath then in a city which has good laws or in future ages is tohave them bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which aregiven by music can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed toteach in the dance anything which they themselves like in the wayof rhythm or melody or words to the young children of parents is the poet to train his choruses as hepleases without reference to virtue or vice 
 cle that is surely quite unreasonable and is not to be thought of 
 ath and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exceptionof egypt 
 cle and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt 
 ath you will wonder when i tell you long ago they appear to haverecognized the very principle of which we are now young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains ofvirtue these they fixed and exhibited the patterns of them intheir temples and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate uponthem or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones to thisday no alteration is allowed either in these arts or in music atall and you will find that their works of art are painted ormoulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand is literally true and no ancientpaintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than thework of but are made with just the same skill 
 cle how extraordinary 
 ath i should rather say how statesmanlike how worthy of alegislator i know that other things in egypt are nat so well butwhat i am telling you about music is true and deserving ofconsideration because showing that a lawgiver may institutemelodies which have a natural truth and correctness without any fearof failure to do this however must be the work of god or of adivine person in egypt they have a tradition that their ancientchants which have been preserved for so many ages are thecomposition of the goddess isis and therefore as i was saying ifa person can only find in any way the natural melodies he mayconfidently embody them in a fixed and legal form for the love ofnovelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of theold has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song anddance under the plea that they have become antiquated at any are far from being corrupted in egypt 
 cle your arguments seem to prove your point 
 ath may we not confidently say that the true use of music and ofchoral festivities is as follows we rejoice when we think that weprosper and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice 
 cle exactly 
 ath and when rejoicing in our good fortune we are unable to bestill 
 cle true 
 ath our young men break forth into dancing and singing and wewho are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life whenwe look on at them having lost our agility we delight in theirsports and because we love to think of our formerselves and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awakenin us the memory of our youth 
 cle very true 
 ath is it altogether unmeaning to say as the common people doabout festivals that he should be adjudged the wisest of men and thewinner of the palm who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure andmirth for on such occasions and when mirth is the order of theday ought not he to be honoured most and as i was saying bearthe palm who gives most mirth to the greatest number now is this atrue way of speaking or of acting 
 cle possibly 
 ath but my dear friend let us distinguish between differentcases and not be hasty in forming a judgment one way ofconsidering the question will be to imagine a festival at whichthere are entertainments of all sorts including gymnastic equestrian contests the citizens are assembled prizes areoffered and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter thelists and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasureto the is to be no regulation about the manner he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crownedvictor and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates what islikely to be the result of such a proclamation 
 cle in what respect 
 ath there would be various exhibitions one man like homer willexhibit a rhapsody another a performance on the lute one will have atragedy and another a comedy nor would there be anything astonishingin some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting suppose these competitors to meet and not these innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be thevictor 
 cle i do not see how any one can answer you or pretend to he has heard with his own ears the several competitors thequestion is absurd 
 ath well then if neither of you can answer shall i answer thisquestion which you deem so absurd 
 cle by all means 
 ath if very small children are to determine the question they willdecide for the puppet show 
 cle of course 
 ath the older children will be advocates of comedy educated young men and people in general will favour tragedy 
 cle very likely 
 ath and i believe that we old men would have the greatestpleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey orone of the hesiodic poems and would award the victory to him would really be the is the question 
 cle yes 
 ath clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we oldmen adjudge victors ought to win for our ways are far and away betterthan any which at present exist anywhere in the world 
 cle certainly 
 ath thus far i too should agree with the many that theexcellence of music is to be measured by pleasure but the pleasuremust not be that of chance persons the fairest music is that whichdelights the best and best educated and especially that whichdelights the one man who is in virtue and education andtherefore the judges must be men of character for they will requireboth wisdom and courage the true judge must not draw hisinspiration from the theatre nor ought he to be unnerved by theclamour of the many and his own incapacity nor again knowing thetruth ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly todeliver a lying judgment with the very same lips which have justappealed to the gods before he judged he is sitting not as thedisciple of the theatre but in his proper place as theirinstructor and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to thepleasure of the spectators the ancient and common custom of still prevails in italy and sicily did certainly leave thejudgment to the body of spectators who determined the victor byshow of hands but this custom has been the destruction of thepoets for they are now in the habit of composing with a view toplease the bad taste of their judges and the result is that thespectators instruct also it has been the ruin of thetheatre they ought to be having characters put before them betterthan their own and so receiving a higher pleasure but now by theirown act the opposite result follows what inference is to be drawnfrom all this shall i tell you 
 cle what 
 ath the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth timeis that education is the constraining and directing of youthtowards that right reason which the law affirms and which theexperience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right inorder then that the soul of the child may not be habituated tofeel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law and thosewho obey the law but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrowat the same things as the order i say to produce thiseffect chants appear to have been invented which really enchant andare designed to implant that harmony of which we speak and becausethe mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious are called plays and songs and are performed in play just aswhen men are sick and ailing in their bodies their attendants givethem wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks but unwholesome dietin disagreeable things in order that they may learn as they like the one and to dislike the other and similarly the truelegislator will persuade and if he cannot persuade will compelthe poet to express as he ought by fair and noble words in hisrhythms the figures and in his melodies the music of temperateand brave and in every way good men 
 cle but do you really imagine stranger that this is the way inwhich poets generally compose in states at the present day as faras i can observe except among us and among the are no regulations like those of which you speak in otherplaces novelties are always being introduced in dancing and inmusic generally not under the authority of any law but at theinstigation of lawless pleasures and these pleasures are so farfrom being the same as you describe the egyptian to be or having thesame principles that they are never the same 
 ath most true cleinias and i daresay that i may have expressedmyself obscurely and so led you to imagine that i was speaking ofsome really existing state of things whereas i was only saying whatregulations i would like to have about music and hence there occurreda misapprehension on your part for when evils are far gone andirremediable the task of censuring them is never pleasant althoughat times necessary but as we do not really differ will you let meask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalentamong the cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes 
 cle certainly they are 
 ath and if they were extended to the other hellenes would it be animprovement on the present state of things 
 cle a very great improvement if the customs which prevail amongthem were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians and such asyou were just now saying ought to prevail 
 ath let us see whether we understand one not theprinciples of education and music which prevail among you asfollows you compel your poets to say that the good man if he betemperate and just is fortunate and happy and this whether he begreat and strong or small and weak and whether he be rich or on the other hand if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras ormidas and be unjust he is wretched and lives in misery as thepoet says and with truth i sing not i care not about him whoaccomplishes all noble things not having justice let him near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a justman but if he be unjust i would not have him look calmly uponbloody death nor surpass in swiftness the thracian boreas and letno other thing that is called good ever be his for the goods of whichthe many speak are not really good first in the catalogue is placedhealth beauty next wealth third and then innumerable others as forexample to have a keen eye or a quick ear and in general to haveall the senses perfect or again to be a tyrant and do as youlike and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquiredall these things and when you have acquired them to become at onceimmortal but you and i say that while to the just and holy all thesethings are the best of possessions to the unjust they are even health the greatest of evils for in truth to havesight and hearing and the use of the senses or to live at allwithout justice and virtue even though a man be rich in all goods of fortune is the greatest of evils if life beimmortal but not so great if the bad man lives only a very shorttime these are the truths which if i am not mistaken you willpersuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments ofharmony and rhythm and in these they must train up your youth am inot right for i plainly declare that evils as they are termed aregoods to the unjust and only evils to the just and that goods aretruly good to the good but evil to the evil let me ask again areyou and i agreed about this 
 cle i think that we partly agree and partly do not 
 ath when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts andwhen he is preeminent in strength and courage and has the gift ofimmortality and none of the evils which goods but only the injustice and insolence of his own an one you are i suspect unwilling to believe that he ismiserable rather than happy 
 cle that is quite true 
 ath once more suppose that he be valiant and strong andhandsome and rich and does throughout his whole life whatever helikes still if he be unrighteous and insolent would not both of youagree that he will of necessity live basely you will surely grantso much 
 cle certainly 
 ath and an evil life too 
 cle i am not equally disposed to grant that 
 ath will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage 
 cle how can i possibly say so 
 ath how then may heaven make us to be of one mind for now weare of two to me dear cleinias the truth of what i am saying isas plain as the fact that crete is an island and if i were alawgiver i would try to make the poets and all the citizens speakin this strain and i would inflict the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad menwho lead pleasant lives or that the profitable and gainful is onething and the just another and there are many other matters aboutwhich i should make my citizens speak in a manner different from thecretans and lacedaemonians of this age and i may say indeed fromthe world in general for tell me my good friends by zeus and apollotell me if i were to ask these same gods who were your the most just life also the pleasantest or are there two of which is the justest and the other the theywere to reply that there are two and thereupon i proceeded to would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry which are who lead the justest or those who lead thepleasantest life and they replied those who lead would be a very strange answer which i should notlike to put into the mouth of the gods the words will come withmore propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators and thereforei will repeat my former questions to one of them and suppose him tosay again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the to that i my father did you not wish me to live ashappily as possible and yet you also never ceased telling me that ishould live as justly as possible now here the giver of the he be legislator or father will be in a dilemma and willin vain endeavour to be consistent with himself but if he were todeclare that the justest life is also the happiest every onehearing him would enquire if i am not mistaken what is that good andnoble principle in life which the law approves and which issuperior to pleasure for what good can the just man have which isseparated from pleasure shall we say that glory and fame coming fromgods and men though good and noble are nevertheless infamy pleasant certainly not sweet legislator or shall wesay that the of wrong and there being no wrong done isgood and honourable although there is no pleasure in it and that thedoing wrong is pleasant but evil and base 
 cle impossible 
 ath the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and thejust and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religioustendency and the opposite view is most at variance with the designsof the legislator and is in his opinion infamous for no one if hecan help will be persuaded to do that which gives him more painthan pleasure but as distant prospects are apt to make us in childhood the legislator will try to purge away thedarkness and exhibit the truth he will persuade the citizens in someway or other by customs and praises and words that just and unjustare shadows only and that injustice which seems opposed tojustice when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasantand the just most unpleasant but that from the just point ofview the very opposite is the appearance of both of them 
 cle true 
 ath and which may be supposed to be the truer ofthe inferior or of the better soul 
 cle surely that of the better soul 
 ath then the unjust life must not only be more base and also more unpleasant than the just and holy life 
 cle that seems to be implied in the present argument 
 ath and even supposing this were otherwise and not as the argumenthas proven still the lawgiver who is worth anything if he everventures to tell a lie to the young for their good could not invent amore useful lie than this or one which will have a better effect inmaking them do what is right not on compulsion but voluntarily 
 cle truth stranger is a noble thing and a lasting but a thing ofwhich men are hard to be persuaded 
 ath and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus which is soimprobable has been readily believed and also innumerable othertales 
 cle what is that story 
 ath the story of armed men springing up after the sowing ofteeth which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuadethe minds of the young of anything so that he has only to reflect andfind out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage andthen use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and thesame word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life if you do not agree with me there is no reason why you should notargue on the other side 
 cle i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by eitherof us against what you are now saying 
 ath the next suggestion which i have to offer is that all ourthree choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we havealready spoken or are about to speak and the sum of them shall the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is alsothe shall affirm this to be a most certain truth and theminds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive thesewords of ours than any others which we might address to them 
 cle i assent to what you say 
 ath first will enter in their natural order the sacred choircomposed of children which is to sing lustily the layto the whole city next will follow the choir of young men under theage of thirty who will call upon the god paean to testify to thetruth of their words and will pray him to be gracious to the youthand to turn their hearts thirdly the choir of elder men who arefrom thirty to sixty years of age will also sing there remainthose who are too old to sing and they will tell the same virtues as with the voice of an oracle 
 cle who are those who compose the third choir stranger for i donot clearly understand what you mean to say about them 
 ath and yet almost all that i have been saying has said with a viewto them 
 cle will you try to be a little plainer 
 ath i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse as youwill remember of the fiery nature of young creatures i said thatthey were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice and thatthey called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner and that noother animal attained to any perception of order but man only nowthe order of motion is called rhythm and the order of the voice inwhich high and low are duly mingled is called harmony and bothtogether are termed choric song and i said that the gods had pityon us and gave us apollo and the muses to be our playfellows andleaders in the dance and dionysus as i dare say that you willremember was the third 
 cle i quite remember 
 ath thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the i have still to speak of the remaining chorus which is that ofdionysus 
 cle how is that arranged there is something strange at any rateon first hearing in a dionysiac chorus of old men if you really meanthat those who are above thirty and may be fifty or from fifty tosixty years of age are to dance in his honour 
 ath very true and therefore it must be shown that there is goodreason for the proposal 
 cle certainly 
 ath are we agreed thus far 
 cle about what 
 ath that every man and boy slave and free both sexes and thewhole city should never cease charming themselves with the strains ofwhich we have spoken and that there should be every sort of changeand variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness sothat the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns and maynever weary of them 
 cle every one will agree 
 ath where then will that best part of our city which by reasonof age and intelligence has the greatest influence sing thesefairest of strains which are to do so much good shall we be sofoolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful andalso the most useful of songs 
 cle but says the argument we cannot let them off 
 ath then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum will thisbe the way 
 cle what 
 ath when a man is advancing in years he is afraid and reluctant has no pleasure in his own performances and if compulsion isused he will be more and more ashamed the older and more discreet not this true 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand upand sing in the theatre to a mixed if moreover when heis required to do so like the other choirs who contend for have been trained under a singing master he is pinched andhungry he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort whichwill make him very unwilling to exhibit 
 cle no doubt 
 ath how then shall we reassure him and get him to sing shall webegin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they areeighteen years of age we will tell them that fire must not bepoured upon fire whether in the body or in the soul until they beginto go to is a precaution which has to be taken against theexcitableness of they may taste wine in moderationup to the age of thirty but while a man is young he should abstainaltogether from intoxication and from excess of wine when at has reached forty years after dinner at a public mess he mayinvite not only the other gods but dionysus above all to the mysteryand festivity of the elder men making use of the wine which he hasgiven men to lighten the sourness of old age that in age we may renewour youth and forget our sorrows and also in order that the natureof the soul like iron melted in the fire may become softer and somore impressible in the first place will not any one who is thusmellowed be more ready and less ashamed to do not say beforea large audience but before a moderate company nor yet amongstrangers but among his familiars and as we have often said tochant and to enchant 
 cle he will be far more ready 
 ath there will be no impropriety in our using such a method ofpersuading them to join with us in song 
 cle none at all 
 ath and what strain will they sing and what muse will they strain should clearly be one suitable to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what strain is suitable for heroes shall they sing achoric strain 
 cle truly stranger we of crete and lacedaemon know no strainother than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing inour chorus 
 ath i dare say for you have never acquired the knowledge of themost beautiful kind of song in your military way of life which ismodelled after the camp and is not like that of dwellers in you have your young men herding and feeding together like youngcolts no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away fromhis fellows against his will raging and foaming and gives him agroom to attend to him alone and trains and rubs him downprivately and gives him the qualities in education which will makehim not only a good soldier but also a governor of a state and ofcities such an one as we said at first would be a greater warriorthan he of whom tyrtaeus sings and he would honour courageeverywhere but always as the fourth and not as the first part ofvirtue either in individuals or states 
 cle once more stranger i must complain that you depreciate ourlawgivers 
 ath not intentionally if at all my good friend but whither theargument leads thither let us follow for if there be indeed somestrain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or thepublic theatres i should like to impart it to those who as we ashamed of these and want to have the best 
 cle certainly 
 ath when things have an accompanying charm either the best thingin them is this very charm or there is some rightness or utilitypossessed by example i should say that eating and the use of food in general have an accompanying charm which wecall pleasure but that this rightness and utility is just thehealthfulness of the things served up to us which is their truerightness 
 cle just so 
 ath thus too i should say that learning has a certainaccompanying charm which is the pleasure but that the right and theprofitable the good and the noble are qualities which the truthgives to it 
 cle exactly 
 ath and so in the imitative they succeed in makinglikenesses and are accompanied by pleasure may not their works besaid to have a charm 
 cle yes 
 ath but equal proportions whether of quality or quantity andnot pleasure speaking generally would give them truth or rightness 
 cle yes 
 ath then that only can be rightly judged by the standard ofpleasure which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality but existssolely for the sake of the accompanying charm and the term most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities areabsent 
 cle you are speaking of harmless pleasure are you not 
 ath yes and this i term amusement when doing neither harm norgood in any degree worth speaking of 
 cle very true 
 ath then if such be our principles we must assert thatimitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion andthis is true of all equality for the equal is not equal or thesymmetrical symmetrical because somebody thinks or likes they are to be judged of by the standard of truth and by no otherwhatever 
 cle quite true 
 ath do we not regard all music as representative and imitative 
 cle certainly 
 ath then when any one says that music is to be judged of bypleasure his doctrine cannot be admitted and if there be any musicof which pleasure is the criterion such music is not to be sought outor deemed to have any real excellence but only that other kind ofmusic which is an imitation of the good 
 cle very true 
 ath and those who seek for the best kind of song and music oughtnot to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is the truth of imitation consists as we were saying in renderingthe thing imitated according to quantity and quality 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every one will admit that musical compositions are allimitative and representative will not poets and spectators and actorsall agree in this 
 cle they will 
 ath surely then he who would judge correctly must know what eachcomposition is for if he does not know what is the character andmeaning of the piece and what it represents he will never discernwhether the intention is true or false 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and will he who does not know what is true be able todistinguish what is good and bad my statement is not very perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter inanother way 
 cle how 
 ath there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight 
 cle yes 
 ath and can he who does not know what the exact object is whichis imitated ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully mean for example whether a statue has the proportions of a the true situation of the parts what those proportions are andhow the parts fit into one another in due order also their coloursand conformations or whether this is all confused in the you think that any one can know about this who does not knowwhat the animal is which has been imitated 
 cle impossible 
 ath but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured isa man who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper partsand colours and shapes must we not also know whether the work isbeautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty 
 cle if this were not required stranger we should all of us bejudges of beauty 
 ath very true and may we not say that in everything in drawing music or any other art he who is to be acompetent judge must possess three must know in thefirst place of what the imitation is secondly he must know thatit is true and thirdly that it has been well executed in words andmelodies and rhythms 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficultyof music music is more celebrated than any other kind of therefore requires the greatest care of them all for if a manmakes a mistake here he may do himself the greatest injury bywelcoming evil dispositions and the mistake may be very difficultto discern because the poets are artists very inferior in characterto the muses themselves who would never fall into the monstrous errorof assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen wouldthey add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort with the rhythms and gestures of freemen would theyassign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of menand instruments and every other sort of noise as if they were allone but human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistentmixture and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those orpheus says are ripe for true pleasure the experienced see allthis confusion and yet the poets go on and make still further havocby separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from themelody setting bare words to metre and also separating the melodyand the rhythm from the words using the lyre or the flute when there are no words it is very difficult to recognize themeaning of the harmony and rhythm or to see that any worthy object isimitated by them and we must acknowledge that all this sort of aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise anduses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of thedance and song is exceedingly coarse and tasteless the use of eitherinstrument when unaccompanied leads to every sort of irregularityand trickery this is all rational enough but we are consideringnot how our choristers who are from thirty to fifty years of age andmay be over fifty are not to use the muses but how they are to usethem and the considerations which we have urged seem to show inwhat way these fifty choristers who are to sing may beexpected to be better trained for they need to have a quickperception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms otherwise howcan they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to thedorian mode or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it 
 cle clearly they cannot 
 ath the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what isin proper harmony and rhythm and what is not when they can only bemade to sing and step in rhythm by force it never occurs to them thatthey are ignorant of what they are doing now every melody is rightwhen it has suitable harmony and rhythm and wrong when unsuitable 
 cle that is most certain 
 ath but can a man who does not know a thing as we were that the thing is right 
 cle impossible 
 ath then now as would appear we are making the discovery that choristers whom we hereby invite and although theyare their own masters compel to sing must be educated to such anextent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notesof the song that they may know the harmonies and rhythms and be ableto select what are suitable for men of their age and character tosing and may sing them and have innocent pleasure from their ownperformance and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delightgood dispositions having such training they will attain a moreaccurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people or evenof the poets themselves for the poet need not know the third whether the imitation is good or not though he can hardlyhelp knowing the laws of melody and rhythm but the aged chorus mustknow all the three that they may choose the best and that which isnearest to the best for otherwise they will never be able to charmthe souls of young men in the way of virtue and now the originaldesign of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to thechorus of dionysus has been accomplished to the best of ourability and let us see whether we were should imagine that adrinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous asthe drinking goes on this as we were saying at first will certainlybe the case 
 cle certainly 
 ath every man has a more than natural elevation his heart isglad within him and he will say anything and will be restrained bynobody at such a time he fancies that he is able to rule over himselfand all mankind 
 cle quite true 
 ath were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of thedrinkers become like iron heated in the fire and grow softer andyounger and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate andfashion them just as when they were young and that this fashioner ofthem is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their the good legislator and that he ought to enact laws of thebanquet which when a man is confident bold and impudent andunwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and drinking and music will change his character into laws as will infuse into him a just and noble will take up arms at the approach of insolence being thatdivine fear which we have called reverence and shame 
 cle true 
 ath and the guardians of these laws and with themare the calm and sober generals of the drinkers and without theirhelp there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than infighting against enemies when the commander of an army is nothimself calm and he who is unwilling to obey them and thecommanders of dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys militaryleaders or even greater 
 cle right 
 ath if then drinking and amusement were regulated in this not the companions of our revels be improved they would partbetter friends than they were and not as now enemies their wholeintercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it and thesober would be the leaders of the drunken 
 cle i think so too if drinking were regulated as you propose 
 ath let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as badand unfit to be received into the state for wine has manyexcellences and one one about which there is adifficulty in speaking to the many from a fear of their misconceivingand misunderstanding what is said 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath there is a tradition or story which has somehow crept aboutthe world that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmotherhere and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancingmadnesses in others for which reason he gave men wine suchtraditions concerning the gods i leave to those who think that theymay be safely uttered i only know that no animal at birth is matureor perfect in intelligence and in the intermediate period in whichhe has not yet acquired his own proper sense he rages and roarswithout rhyme or reason and when he has once got on his legs he jumpsabout without rhyme or reason and this as you will remember hasbeen already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic 
 cle to be sure i remember 
 ath and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythmsprang from this beginning among men and that apollo and the musesand dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them 
 cle certainly 
 ath the other story implied that wine was given man out of in order to make him mad but our present doctrine on thecontrary is that wine was given him as a balm and in order toimplant modesty in the soul and health and strength in the body 
 cle that stranger is precisely what was said 
 ath then half the subject may now be considered to have beendiscussed shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half 
 cle what is the other half and how do you divide the subject 
 ath the whole choral art is also in our view the whole ofeducation and of this art rhythms and harmonies form the partwhich has to do with the voice 
 cle yes 
 ath the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movementof the voice but gesture is peculiar to it whereas song is simplythe movement of the voice 
 cle most true 
 ath and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the have ventured to term music 
 cle we were right 
 ath and the movement of the body when regarded as an amusement wetermed dancing but when extended and pursued with a view to theexcellence of the body this scientific training may be calledgymnastic 
 cle exactly 
 ath music which was one half of the choral art may be said tohave been completely discussed shall we proceed to the other halfor not what would you like 
 cle my good friend when you are talking with a cretan andlacedaemonian and we have discussed music and not gymnastic whatanswer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry 
 ath an answer is contained in your question and i understand andaccept what you say not only as an answer but also as a command toproceed with gymnastic 
 cle you quite understand me do as you say 
 ath i will and there will not be any difficulty in speakingintelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are farmore familiar than with music 
 cle there will not 
 ath is not the origin of gymnastics too to be sought in thetendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals man as wewere saying having attained the sense of rhythm created and inventeddancing and melody arousing and awakening rhythm both unitedformed the choral art 
 cle very true 
 ath and one part of this subject has been already discussed byus and there still remains another to be discussed 
 cle exactly 
 ath i have first a final word to add to my discourse about you will allow me to do so 
 cle what more have you to say 
 ath i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt thepractice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to theenforcement of temperance and in like manner and on the sameprinciple will allow of other pleasures designing to gain thevictory over them in this way all of them may be used but if thestate makes drinking an amusement only and whoever likes may drinkwhenever he likes and with whom he likes and add to this any otherindulgences i shall never agree or allow that this city or this manshould practise drinking i would go further than the cretans andlacedaemonians and am disposed rather to the law of thecarthaginians that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowedto taste wine at all but that he should drink water during all thattime and that in the city no slave male or female should ever drinkwine and that no magistrates should drink during their year ofoffice nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty tastewine at all nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about anymatter of importance nor in the daytime at all unless in consequenceof exercise or as medicine nor again at night when any one eitherman or woman is minded to get children there are numberless othercases also in which those who have good sense and good laws oughtnot to drink wine so that if what i say is true no city will needmany vineyards their husbandry and their way of life in generalwill follow an appointed order and their cultivation of the vine willbe the most limited and the least common of their employments andthis stranger shall be the crown of my discourse about wine ifyou agree 
 cle excellent we agree

 book iii 
 
 athenian stranger enough of this and what then is to be regardedas the origin of government will not a man be able to judge of itbest from a point of view in which he may behold the progress ofstates and their transitions to good or evil 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 ath i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages 
 cle how so 
 ath why do you think that you can reckon the time which haselapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them 
 cle hardly 
 ath but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and have not thousands and thousands of cities come intobeing during this period and as many perished and has not each ofthem had every form of government many times over now growing smaller and again improving or declining 
 cle to be sure 
 ath let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes forthat will probably explain the first origin and development of formsof government 
 cle very good you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to we will make an effort to understand you 
 ath do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions 
 cle what traditions 
 ath the traditions about the many destructions of mankind whichhave been occasioned by deluges and pestilences and in many otherways and of the survival of a remnant 
 cle every one is disposed to believe them 
 ath let us consider one of them that which was caused by thefamous deluge 
 cle what are we to observe about it 
 ath i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be sparks of the human race preserved on the tops ofmountains 
 cle clearly 
 ath such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with thearts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers incities by interest or ambition and with all the wrongs which theycontrive against one another 
 cle very true 
 ath let us suppose then that the cities in the plain and on were utterly destroyed at that time 
 cle very good 
 ath would not all implements have then perished and every otherexcellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom haveutterly disappeared 
 cle why yes my friend and if things had always continued as theyare at present ordered how could any discovery have ever been madeeven in the least particular for it is evident that the arts wereunknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years and no more thana thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries ofdaedalus orpheus and marsyas and olympus inventedmusic and amphion the to speak of numberless otherinventions which are but of yesterday 
 ath have you forgotten cleinias the name of a friend who isreally of yesterday 
 cle i suppose that you mean epimenides 
 ath the same my friend he does indeed far overleap the heads ofall mankind by his invention for he carried out in practice as youdeclare what of old hesiod only preached 
 cle yes according to our tradition 
 ath after the great destruction may we not suppose that thestate of man was something of this the beginning of thingsthere was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land aherd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal there might be a few goats these too hardly enough to maintainthe shepherds who tended them 
 cle true 
 ath and of cities or governments or legislation about which we arenow talking do you suppose that they could have any recollection atall 
 cle none whatever 
 ath and out of this state of things has there not sprung all thatwe now are and have cities and governments and arts and laws anda great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath why my good friend how can we possibly suppose that those whoknew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attainedtheir full development whether of virtue or of vice 
 cle i understand your meaning and you are quite right 
 ath but as time advanced and the race multiplied the world cameto be what the world is 
 cle very true 
 ath doubtless the change was not made all in a moment but littleby little during a very long period of time 
 cle a highly probable supposition 
 ath at first they would have a natural fear ringing in theirears which would prevent their descending from the heights into theplain 
 cle of course 
 ath the fewness of the survivors at that time would have madethem all the more desirous of seeing one another but then the meansof travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely i may say with the loss of the arts and there was greatdifficulty in getting at one another for iron and brass and allmetals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos nor wasthere any possibility of extracting ore from them and they hadscarcely any means of felling timber even if you suppose that someimplements might have been preserved in the mountains they mustquickly have worn out and vanished and there would be no more of themuntil the art of metallurgy had again revived 
 cle there could not have been 
 ath in how many generations would this be attained 
 cle clearly not for many generations 
 ath during this period and for some time afterwards all thearts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear 
 cle certainly 
 ath faction and war would also have died out in those days and formany reasons 
 cle how would that be 
 ath in the first place the desolation of these primitive men wouldcreate in them a feeling of affection and towards oneanother and secondly they would have no occasion to quarrel abouttheir subsistence for they would have pasture in abundance exceptjust at first and in some particular cases and from they would obtain the greater part of their food in aprimitive age having plenty of milk and flesh moreover they wouldprocure other food by the chase not to be despised either in quantityor quality they would also have abundance of clothing and dwellings and utensils either capable of standing on the fireor not for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use ofiron and god has given these two arts to man in order to providehim with all such things that when reduced to the last human race may still grow and increase hence in those daysmankind were not very poor nor was poverty a cause of differenceamong them and rich they could not have been having neither gold at that time was their condition and the community whichhas neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblestprinciples in it there is no insolence or injustice nor there any contentions or envyings and therefore they were also because they were what is called and when theywere told about good and evil they in their simplicity believedwhat they heard to be very truth and practised it no one had thewit to suspect another of a falsehood as men do now but what theyheard about gods and men they believed to be true and livedaccordingly and therefore they were in all respects such as we havedescribed them 
 cle that quite accords with my views and with those of my friendhere 
 ath would not many generations living on in a simple ruder perhaps and more ignorant of the arts in particular of those of land or naval warfare and likewise ofother arts termed in cities legal practices and party including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in wordand inferior to those who lived before the deluge orto the men of our day in these respects would they not i say besimpler and more manly and also more temperate and altogether morejust the reason has been already explained 
 cle very true 
 ath i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and whatis about to follow has been and will be said with the intentionof explaining what need the men of that time had of laws and whowas their lawgiver 
 cle and thus far what you have said has been very well said 
 ath they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet nothing of thatsort was likely to have existed in their days for they had no lettersat this early period they lived by habit and the customs of theirancestors as they are called 
 cle probably 
 ath but there was already existing a form of government which if iam not mistaken is generally termed a lordship and this stillremains in many places both among hellenes and barbarians and is thegovernment which is declared by homer to have prevailed among thecyclopes 
 they have neither councils nor judgments but they dwell in hollowcaves on the tops of high mountains and every one gives law to hiswife and children and they do not busy themselves about one another 
 cle that seems to be a charming poet of yours i have read someother verses of his which are very clever but i do not know muchof him for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans 
 megillus but they are in lacedaemon and he appears to be theprince of them all the manner of life however which he describes isnot spartan but rather ionian and he seems quite to confirm what youare saying when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the helpof tradition to barbarism 
 ath yes he does confirm it and we may accept his witness to thefact that such forms of government sometimes arise 
 cle we may 
 ath and were not such states composed of men who had been dispersedin single habitations and families by the poverty which attended thedevastations and did not the eldest then rule among them becausewith them government originated in the authority of a father and amother whom like a flock of birds they followed forming onetroop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their of all sovereignties is the most just 
 cle very true 
 ath after this they came together in greater numbers and increasedthe size of their cities and betook themselves to husbandry first ofall at the foot of the mountains and made enclosures of loose wallsand works of defence in order to keep off wild beasts thuscreating a single large and common habitation 
 cle yes at least we may suppose so 
 ath there is another thing which would probably happen 
 cle what 
 ath when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesseroriginal ones each of the lesser ones would survive in the family would be under the rule of the eldest and owing totheir separation from one another would have peculiar customs inthings divine and human which they would have received from theirseveral parents who had educated them and these customs would inclinethem to order when the parents had the element of order in theirnature and to courage when they had the element of courage and theywould naturally stamp upon their children and upon their their own likings and as we are saying they would findtheir way into the larger society having already their own peculiarlaws 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every man surely likes his own laws best and the laws ofothers not so well 
 cle true 
 ath then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings oflegislation 
 cle exactly 
 ath the next step will be that these persons who have met select some arbiters who will review the laws of all of will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs wholead the tribes and who are in a manner their kings allowing them tochoose those which they think best these persons will themselves becalled legislators and will appoint the magistrates framing somesort of aristocracy or perhaps monarchy out of the dynasties orlordships and in this altered state of the government they will live 
 cle yes that would be the natural order of things 
 ath then now let us speak of a third form of government inwhich all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur 
 cle what is that 
 ath the form which in fact homer indicates as following the third form arose when as he says dardanus founded dardania 
 for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be acity of speaking men but they were still dwelling at the foot indeed in these verses and in what he said of the cyclopes hespeaks the words of god and nature for poets are a divine race andoften in their strains by the aid of the muses and the graces theyattain truth 
 cle yes 
 ath then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale which willprobably be found to illustrate in some degree our we do so 
 cle by all means 
 ath ilium was built when they descended from the mountain in alarge and fair plain on a sort of low hill watered by many riversdescending from ida 
 cle such is the tradition 
 ath and we must suppose this event to have taken place many agesafter the deluge 
 ath a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction wouldappear to have come over them when they placed their town right undernumerous streams flowing from the heights trusting for their securityto not very high hills either 
 cle there must have been a long interval clearly 
 ath and as population increased many other cities would beginto be inhabited 
 cle doubtless 
 ath those cities made war against sea as well as that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea 
 cle clearly 
 ath the achaeans remained ten years and overthrew troy 
 cle true 
 ath and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besiegingilium the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil youth revolted and when the soldiers returned to their owncities and families they did not receive them properly and as theyought to have done and numerous deaths murders exiles were theconsequence the exiles came again under a new name no longerachaeans but name which they derived from dorieus for itwas he who gathered them together the rest of the story is told byyou lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta 
 meg to be sure 
 ath thus after digressing from the original subject of laws intomusic and the argument has providentially comeback to the same point and presents to us another handle for we havereached the settlement of lacedaemon which as you truly say is inlaws and in institutions the sister of crete and we are all thebetter for the digression because we have gone through variousgovernments and settlements and have been present at the foundationof a first second and third state succeeding one another ininfinite time and now there appears on the horizon a fourth stateor nation which was once in process of settlement and has continuedsettled to this day if out of all this we are able to discernwhat is well or ill settled and what laws are the salvation andwhat are the destruction of cities and what changes would make astate happy o megillus and cleinias we may now begin again unlesswe have some fault to find with the previous discussion 
 meg if some god stranger would promise us that our new enquiryabout legislation would be as good and full as the present i would goa great way to hear such another and would think that a day as longas we are now approaching the longest day of the tooshort for the discussion 
 ath then i suppose that we must consider this subject 
 meg certainly 
 ath let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when lacedaemonand argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were all incomplete subjection megillus to your ancestors for afterwards asthe legend informs us they divided their army into three settled three cities argos messene lacedaemon 
 meg true 
 ath temenus was the king of argos cresphontes of and eurysthenes of lacedaemon 
 meg certainly 
 ath to these kings all the men of that day made oath that theywould assist them if any one subverted their kingdom 
 meg true 
 ath but can a kingship be destroyed or was any other form ofgovernment ever destroyed by any but the rulers themselves noindeed by zeus have we already forgotten what was said a littlewhile ago 
 meg no 
 ath and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned forwe have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the sameprinciple so that in resuming the discussion we shall not beenquiring about an empty theory but about events which actuallyhappened the case was as royal heroes made oath tothree cities which were under a kingly government and the cities tothe kings that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governedaccording to the laws which were common to all of them the rulerspromised that as time and the race went forward they would not maketheir rule more arbitrary and the subjects said that if the rulersobserved these conditions they would never subvert or permit othersto subvert those kingdoms the kings were to assist kings andpeoples when injured and the peoples were to assist peoples and kingsin like manner is not this the fact 
 meg yes 
 ath and the three states to whom these laws were given whethertheir kings or any others were the authors of them had thereforethe greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions 
 meg what security 
 ath that the other two states were always to come to the rescueagainst a rebellious third 
 meg true 
 ath many persons say that legislators ought to impose such lawsas the mass of the people will be ready to receive but this is justas if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treator cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner 
 meg exactly 
 ath whereas the physician may often be too happy if he canrestore health and make the body whole without any very greatinfliction of pain 
 meg certainly 
 ath there was also another advantage possessed by the men of thatday which greatly lightened the task of passing laws 
 meg what advantage 
 ath the legislators of that day when they equalized the great accusation which generally arises in legislation ifa person attempts to disturb the possession of land or to abolishdebts because he sees that without this reform there can never be anyreal equality now in general when the legislator attempts to make anew settlement of such matters every one meets him with the cry is not to disturb vested with imprecationsthat he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts untila man is at his wits end whereas no one could quarrel with thedorians for distributing the was nothing to hinder as for debts they had none which were considerable or of oldstanding 
 meg very true 
 ath but then my good friends why did the settlement andlegislation of their country turn out so badly 
 meg how do you mean and why do you blame them 
 ath there were three kingdoms and of these two quicklycorrupted their original constitution and laws and the only one whichremained was the spartan 
 meg the question which you ask is not easily answered 
 ath and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws thisbeing our old sober game of play whereby we beguile the way asi was saying when we first set out on our journey 
 meg certainly and we must find out why this was 
 ath what laws are more worthy of our attention than those whichhave regulated such cities or what settlements of states aregreater or more famous 
 meg i know of none 
 ath can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutionsnot only for the protection of peloponnesus but of all thehellenes in case they were attacked by the barbarian for theinhabitants of the region about ilium when they provoked by theirinsolence the trojan war relied upon the power of the assyrians andthe empire of ninus which still existed and had a great prestige thepeople of those days fearing the united assyrian empire just as we nowfear the great king and the second capture of troy was a seriousoffence against them because troy was a portion of the assyrianempire to meet the danger the single army was distributed betweenthree cities by the royal brothers sons of fair device asit seemed and a far better arrangement than the expedition againsttroy for firstly the people of that day had as they thought inthe heraclidae better leaders than the pelopidae in the next considered that their army was superior in valour to that whichwent against troy for although the latter conquered the were themselves conquered by the bydorians may we not suppose that this was the intention with which themen of those days framed the constitutions of their states 
 meg quite true 
 ath and would not men who had shared with one another many were governed by a single race of royal brothers and had takenthe advice of oracles and in particular of the delphian apollo belikely to think that such states would be firmly and lastinglyestablished 
 meg of course they would 
 ath yet these institutions of which such great expectations wereentertained seem to have all rapidly vanished away with theexception as i was saying of that small part of them which existedin this third part has never to this day ceased warringagainst the two others whereas if the original idea had been carriedout and they had agreed to be one their power would have beeninvincible in war 
 meg no doubt 
 ath but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy here is asubject well worthy of consideration 
 meg certainly no one will ever find more striking instances oflaws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great andnoble interests than are here presented to his view 
 ath then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real andimportant question 
 meg very true 
 ath did you never remark sage friend that all men and weourselves at this moment often fancy that they see some beautifulthing which might have effected wonders if any one had only knownhow to make a right use of it in some way and yet this mode oflooking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake and notaccording to nature either in our own case or in any other 
 meg to what are you referring and what do you mean 
 ath i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaidheracleid expedition which was so noble and might have had suchwonderful results for the hellenes if only rightly used and i wasjust laughing at myself 
 meg but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did andwe in assenting to you 
 ath perhaps and yet i cannot help observing that any one whosees anything great or powerful immediately has the the owner only knew how to use his great and noblepossession how happy would he be and what great results would heachieve 
 meg and would he not be justified 
 ath reflect in what point of view does this sort of praiseappear just first in reference to the question in thethen commanders had known how to arrange their army properly howwould they have attained success would not this have been the would have bound them all firmly together and preserved themfor ever giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure combinedwith the power of doing in the whole world hellenic and they and their descendants desired what other aim would theyhave had 
 meg very good 
 ath suppose any one were in the same way to express hisadmiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour or the would praise them under the idea that through them he wouldattain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires 
 meg he would 
 ath well now and does not the argument show that there is onecommon desire of all mankind 
 meg what is it 
 ath the desire which a man has that all things if anyrate things come to pass in accordance with his 
 meg certainly 
 ath and having this desire always and at every time of life inyouth in manhood in age he cannot help always praying for thefulfilment of it 
 meg no doubt 
 ath and we join in the prayers of our friends and ask for themwhat they ask for themselves 
 meg we do 
 ath dear is the son to the younger to the elder 
 meg of course 
 ath and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the fatherprays that he may not obtain 
 meg when the son is young and foolish you mean 
 ath yes or when the father in the dotage of age or the heat ofyouth having no sense of right and justice prays with fervour underthe influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursedthe unfortunate hippolytus do you imagine that the son having asense of right and justice will join in his prayers 
 meg i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or bein a hurry to have all things according to his wish for his wishmay be at variance with his reason but every state and everyindividual ought to pray and strive for wisdom 
 ath yes and i remember and you will remember what i said atfirst that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with aview to wisdom while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought toorder all with a view to war and to this i replied that there werefour virtues but that upon your view one of them only was the aimof legislation whereas you ought to regard all virtue and especiallythat which comes first and is the leader of all the meanwisdom and mind and opinion having affection and desire in theirtrain and now the argument returns to the same point and i sayonce more in jest if you like or in earnest if you like that theprayer of a fool is full of danger being likely to end in theopposite of what he desires and if you would rather receive mywords in earnest i am willing that you should and you will find isuspect as i have said already that not cowardice was the cause ofthe ruin of the dorian kings and of their whole design norignorance of military matters either on the part of the rulers orof their subjects but their misfortunes were due to their generaldegeneracy and especially to their ignorance of the most importanthuman affairs that was then and is still and always will be thecase as i will endeavour if you will allow me to make out anddemonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends in thecourse of the argument 
 cle pray go on are troublesome but wewill show not in word but in deed how greatly we prize your we will give them our best attention and that is the way in whicha freeman best shows his approval or disapproval 
 meg excellent cleinias let us do as you say 
 cle by all means if heaven wills go on 
 ath well then proceeding in the same train of thought i say thatthe greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power and that then ignorance is ruin and if this be true the legislator mustendeavour to implant wisdom in states and banish ignorance to theutmost of his power 
 cle that is evident 
 ath then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance ishould like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me inwhat i am about to say for my opinion is 
 cle what 
 ath that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which henevertheless thinks to be good and noble and loves and embracesthat which he knows to be unrighteous and evil this disagreementbetween the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soulis in my opinion the worst ignorance and also the greatest becauseaffecting the great mass of the human soul for the principle whichfeels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populacein a state and when the soul is opposed to knowledge or reason which are her natural lords that i call folly just asin the state when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers andthe laws or again in the individual when fair reasonings havetheir habitation in the soul and yet do no good but rather thereverse of good all these cases i term the worst ignorance whetherin individuals or in states you will understand stranger that iam speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance ofhandicraftsmen 
 cle yes my friend we understand and agree 
 ath let us then in the first place declare and affirm that thecitizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind ofauthority entrusted to him he must be stigmatized as ignorant eventhough he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts ofaccomplishments and feats of mental dexterity and the opposite areto be called wise even although in the words of the proverb theyknow neither how to read nor how to swim and to them as to men ofsense authority is to be committed for o my friends how canthere be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony there isnone but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said tobe the greatest wisdom and of this he is a partaker who livesaccording to reason whereas he who is devoid of reason is thedestroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of thestate he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom let this i was saying be laid down by us 
 cle let it be so laid down 
 ath i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what are the principles on which men rule and obey incities whether great or small and similarly in families what arethey and how many in number is there not one claim of authoritywhich is always of fathers and mothers and in general ofprogenitors to rule over their offspring 
 cle there is 
 ath next follows the principle that the noble should rule overthe ignoble and thirdly that the elder should rule and theyounger obey 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and fourthly that slaves should be ruled and their mastersrule 
 cle of course 
 ath fifthly if i am not mistaken comes the principle that thestronger shall rule and the weaker be ruled 
 cle that is a rule not to be disobeyed 
 ath yes and a rule which prevails very widely among all is according to nature as the theban poet pindar once said andthe sixth principle and the greatest of all is that the wise shouldlead and command and the ignorant follow and obey and yet o thoumost wise pindar as i should reply him this surely is not contraryto nature but according to nature being the rule of law over willingsubjects and not a rule of compulsion 
 cle most true 
 ath there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot and isdear to the gods and a token of good fortune he on whom the lot fallsis a ruler and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is thesubject and this we affirm to be quite just 
 cle certainly 
 ath then now as we say playfully to any of those who lightlyundertake the making of laws you see legislator the principlesof government how many they are and that they are naturallyopposed to each other there we have discovered a ofseditions to which you must attend and first we will ask you toconsider with us how and in what respect the kings of argos andmessene violated these our maxims and ruined themselves and the greatand famous hellenic power of the olden time was it because they didnot know how wisely hesiod spoke when he said that the half is oftenmore than the whole his meaning was that when to take the wholewould be dangerous and to take the half would be the safe andmoderate course then the moderate or better was more than theimmoderate or worse 
 cle very true 
 ath and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal whenfound among kings than when among peoples 
 cle the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especiallyprevalent among kings because they lead a proud and luxurious life 
 ath is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that timewas to get the better of the established laws and that they werenot in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe byword and oath this want of harmony may have had the appearance ofwisdom but was really as we assert the greatest ignorance andutterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord 
 cle very likely 
 ath good and what measures ought the legislator to have then takenin order to avert this calamity truly there is no great wisdom inknowing and no great difficulty in telling after the evil hashappened but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have takena much wiser head than ours 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath any one who looks at what has occurred with you may easily know and may easily say what ought to have beendone at that time 
 meg speak a little more clearly 
 ath nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about tomake 
 meg what is it 
 ath that if any one gives too great a power to anything toolarge a sail to a vessel too much food to the body too muchauthority to the mind and does not observe the mean everything isoverthrown and in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case todisorders and in the other to injustice which is the child ofexcess i mean to say my dear friends that there is no soul ofman young and irresponsible who will be able to sustain thetemptation of arbitrary one who will not under suchcircumstances become filled with folly that worst of diseases andbe hated by his nearest and dearest friends when this happens hiskingdom is undermined and all his power vanishes from him andgreat legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger asfar as we can guess at this distance of time what happened was asfollows 
 meg what 
 ath a god who watched over sparta seeing into the future gaveyou two families of kings instead of one and thus brought you morewithin the limits of moderation in the next place some humanwisdom mingled with divine power observing that the constitution ofyour government was still feverish and excited tempered your inbornstrength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of the power of your elders equal with that of thekings in the most important matters but your third that your government was still swelling and foaming anddesirous to impose a curb upon it instituted the ephors whosepower he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot and bythis arrangement the kingly office being compounded of the rightelements and duly moderated was preserved and was the means ofpreserving all the rest since if there had been only the originallegislators temenus cresphontes and their contemporaries as far asthey were concerned not even the portion of aristodemus would havebeen preserved for they had no proper experience in legislation orthey would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate ayouthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted intoa tyranny now that god has instructed us what sort of governmentwould have been or will be lasting there is no wisdom as i havealready said in judging after the event there is no difficulty inlearning from an example which has already occurred but if any onecould have foreseen all this at the time and had been able tomoderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into might have saved all the excellent institutions which were thenconceived and no persian or any other armament would have dared toattack us or would have regarded hellas as a power to be despised 
 cle true 
 ath there was small credit to us cleinias in defeating the discredit was not that the conquerors did not win gloriousvictories both by land and sea but what in my opinion broughtdiscredit was first of all the circumstance that of the three citiesone only fought on behalf of hellas and the two others were soutterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty waragainst lacedaemon and was thus preventing her from renderingassistance while the city of argos which had the precedence at thetime of the distribution when asked to aid in repelling thebarbarian would not answer to the call or give aid many thingsmight be told about hellas in connection with that war which are farfrom honourable nor indeed can we rightly say that hellasrepelled the invader for the truth is that unless the atheniansand lacedaemonians acting in concert had warded off the impendingyoke all the tribes of hellas would have been fused in a chaos ofhellenes mingling with one another of barbarians mingling withhellenes and hellenes with barbarians just as nations who are nowsubject to the persian power owing to unnatural separations andcombinations of them are dispersed and scattered and live cleinias and megillus are the reproaches which we have to makeagainst statesmen and legislators as they are called past andpresent if we would analyse the causes of their failure and find outwhat else might have been done we said for instance just there ought to be no great and unmixed powers and this was underthe idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious andthat a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end nor isthere any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims forthe legislator which appear not to be always the same but we shouldconsider when we say that temperance is to be the aim or wisdom is tobe the aim or friendship is to be the aim that all these aims arereally the same and if so a variety in the modes of expression oughtnot to disturb us 
 cle let us resume the argument in that spirit and now speaking offriendship and wisdom and freedom i wish that you would tell me atwhat in your opinion the legislator should aim 
 ath hear me then there are two mother forms of states fromwhich the rest may be truly said to be derived and one of them may becalled monarchy and the other democracy the persians have the highestform of the one and we of the other almost all the rest as i wassaying are variations of these now if you are to have liberty andthe combination of friendship with wisdom you must have both theseforms of government in a measure the argument emphatically declaresthat no city can be well governed which is not made up of both 
 cle impossible 
 ath neither the one if it be exclusively and excessivelyattached to monarchy nor the other if it be similarly attached tofreedom observes moderation but your states the laconian andcretan have more of it and the same was the case with theathenians and persians of old time but now they have less shall itell you why 
 cle by all means if it will tend to elucidate our subject 
 ath hear was a time when the persians had more ofthe state which is a mean between slavery and freedom in the reign ofcyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others the rulers gavea share of freedom to the subjects and being treated as equals thesoldiers were on better terms with their generals and showedthemselves more ready in the hour of danger and if there was any wiseman among them who was able to give good counsel he imparted hiswisdom to the public for the king was not jealous but allowed himfull liberty of speech and gave honour to those who could advisehim in any matter and the nation waxed in all respects because therewas freedom and friendship and communion of mind among them 
 cle that certainly appears to have been the case 
 ath how then was this advantage lost under cambyses and againrecovered under darius shall i try to divine 
 cle the enquiry no doubt has a bearing upon our subject 
 ath i imagine that cyrus though a great and patriotic general hadnever given his mind to education and never attended to the orderof his household 
 cle what makes you say so 
 ath i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier andentrusted the education of his children to the women and they broughtthem up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune who wereblessed already and needed no more blessings they thought thatthey were happy enough and that no one should be allowed to opposethem in any way and they compelled every one to praise all thatthey said or did this was how they brought them up 
 cle a splendid education truly 
 ath such an one as women were likely to give them and especiallyprincesses who had recently grown rich and in the absence of the who were occupied in wars and dangers and had no time to lookafter them 
 cle what would you expect 
 ath their father had possessions of cattle and sheep and manyherds of men and other animals but he did not consider that thoseto whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his owncalling which was persian for the persians are of arugged land which is a stern mother and well fitted to producesturdy race able to live in the open air and go without sleep andalso to fight if fighting is required he did not observe that hissons were trained differently through the blessing of beingroyal they were educated in the median fashion by women and led to their becoming such as people do become when they arebrought up unreproved and so after the death of cyrus his the fulness of luxury and licence took the kingdom and firstone slew the other because he could not endure a rival the slayer himself mad with wine and brutality losthis kingdom through the medes and the eunuch as they called despised the folly of cambyses 
 cle so runs the tale and such probably were the facts 
 ath yes and the tradition says that the empire came back to thepersians through darius and the seven chiefs 
 cle true 
 ath let us note the rest of the story observe that darius was notthe son of a king and had not received a luxurious education when hecame to the throne being one of the seven he divided the countryinto seven portions and of this arrangement there are some shadowytraces still remaining he made laws upon the principle of introducinguniversal equality in the order of the state and he embodied in hislaws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus a feeling of friendship and community among all the attaching the people to him with money and gifts hence his armiescheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrushad left behind him darius was succeeded by his son xerxes and heagain was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion might wenot most justly say o darius how came you to bring up xerxes in thesame way in which cyrus brought up cambyses and not to see hisfatal mistake for xerxes being the creation of the sameeducation met with much the same fortune as cambyses and from thattime until now there has never been a really great king among thepersians although they are all called great and their degeneracyis not to be attributed to chance as i maintain the reason is ratherthe evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich androyal persons for never will boy or man young or old excel invirtue who has been thus educated and this i say is what thelegislator has to consider and what at the present moment has to beconsidered by us justly may you o lacedaemonians be praised inthat you do not give special honour or a special education to wealthrather than to poverty or to a royal rather than to a privatestation where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originallycommanded them to be given for no man ought to have in a state because he surpasses others in wealth any more thanbecause he is swift of foot or fair or strong unless he have somevirtue in him nor even if he have virtue unless he have thisparticular virtue of temperance 
 meg what do you mean stranger 
 ath i suppose that courage is a part of virtue 
 meg to be sure 
 ath then now hear and judge for you like to havefor a or neighbour a very courageous man who had nocontrol over himself 
 meg heaven forbid 
 ath or an artist who was clever in his profession but a rogue 
 meg certainly not 
 ath and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance 
 meg impossible 
 ath any more than our pattern wise man whom we exhibited as havinghis pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to truereason can be intemperate 
 meg no 
 ath there is a further consideration relating to the due andundue award of honours in states 
 meg what is it 
 ath i should like to know whether temperance without the othervirtues existing alone in the soul of man is rightly to be praisedor blamed 
 meg i cannot tell 
 ath and that is the best answer for whichever alternative youhad chosen i think that you would have gone wrong 
 meg i am fortunate 
 ath very good a quality which is a mere appendage of things whichcan be praised or blamed does not deserve an expression of is best passed over in silence 
 meg you are speaking of temperance 
 ath yes but of the other virtues that which having this appendageis also most beneficial will be most deserving of honour and nextthat which is beneficial in the next degree and so each of themwill be rightly honoured according to a regular order 
 meg true 
 ath and ought not the legislator to determine these classes 
 meg certainly he should 
 ath suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details butthe general division of laws according to their importance into afirst and second and third class we who are lovers of law may makeourselves 
 meg very good 
 ath we maintain then that a state which would be safe andhappy as far as the nature of man allows must and ought todistribute honour and dishonour in the right way and the right way isto place the goods of the soul first and highest in the assuming temperance to be the condition of them and toassign the second place to the goods of the body and the thirdplace to money and property and it any legislator or state departsfrom this rule by giving money the place of honour or in any waypreferring that which is really last may we not say that he or thestate is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing 
 meg yes let that be plainly declared 
 ath the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far toenlarge we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse and weaffirm the reason of this to have been that they too muchdiminished the freedom of the people and introduced too much ofdespotism and so destroyed friendship and community of feeling andwhen there is an end of these no longer do the governors govern onbehalf of their subjects or of the people but on behalf ofthemselves and if they think that they can gain ever so small anadvantage for themselves they devastate cities and send fire anddesolation among friendly races and as they hate ruthlessly andhorribly so are they hated and when they want the people to fightfor them they find no community of feeling or willingness to risktheir lives on their behalf their untold myriads are useless tothem on the field of battle and they think that their salvationdepends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they if they were in want of more men and they cannot help beingstupid since they proclaim by actions that the ordinarydistinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are atrifle when compared with gold and silver 
 meg quite true 
 ath and now enough of the persians and their presentmaladministration of their government which is owing to the excess ofslavery and despotism among them 
 meg good 
 ath next we must pass in review the government of attica in likemanner and from this show that entire freedom and the absence ofall superior authority is not by any means so good as government byothers when properly limited which was our ancient athenianconstitution at the time when the persians made their attack onhellas or speaking more correctly on the whole continent of were four classes arranged according to a property reverence was our queen and mistress and made us willing tolive in obedience to the laws which then prevailed also thevastness of the persian armament both by sea and on land caused ahelpless terror which made us more and more the servants of ourrulers and of the laws and for all these reasons an exceeding harmonyprevailed among us about ten years before the naval engagement atsalamis datis came leading a persian host by command of was expressly directed against the athenians and orders to carry them away captive and these orders he was toexecute under pain of death now datis and his myriads soon becamecomplete masters of eretria and he sent a fearful report to athensthat no eretrian had escaped him for the soldiers of datis had joinedhands and netted the whole of eretria and this report whether wellor ill founded was terrible to all the hellenes and above all to theathenians and they dispatched embassies in all directions but no onewas willing to come to their relief with the exception of thelacedaemonians and they either because they were detained by themessenian war which was then going on or for some other reason ofwhich we are not told came a day too late for the battle of a while the news arrived of mighty preparations being made andinnumerable threats came from the king then as time went on arumour reached us that darius had died and that his son who wasyoung and had come to the throne and was persisting in hisdesign the athenians were under the impression that the wholeexpedition was directed against them in consequence of the battleof marathon and hearing of the bridge over the hellespont and thecanal of athos and the host of ships considering that there was nosalvation for them either by land or by sea for there was no one tohelp them and remembering that in the first expedition when thepersians destroyed eretria no one came to their help or would riskthe danger of an alliance with them they thought that this wouldhappen again at least on land nor when they looked to the they descry any hope of salvation for they were attacked by athousand vessels and more one chance of safety remained slightindeed and desperate but their only one they saw that on theformer occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible victory andborne up by this hope they found that their only refuge was inthemselves and in the gods all these things created in them thespirit of friendship there was the fear of the moment and therewas that higher fear which they had acquired by obedience to theirancient laws and which i have several times in the precedingdiscourse called reverence of which the good man ought to be awilling servant and of which the coward is independent andfearless if this fear had not possessed them they would never havemet the enemy or defended their temples and sepulchres and theircountry and everything that was near and dear to them as they little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed 
 meg your words athenian are quite true and worthy of yourselfand of your country 
 ath they are true megillus and to you who have inherited thevirtues of your ancestors i may properly speak of the actions of thatday and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my wordshave not also a bearing on legislation for i am not discoursingonly for the pleasure of talking but for the to remark that the experience both of ourselves and thepersians was in a certain sense the same for as they led theirpeople into utter servitude so we too led ours into all now how shall we proceed for i would like you to observe thatour previous arguments have good deal to say for themselves 
 meg true but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation 
 ath i will under the ancient laws my friends the people wasnot as now the master but rather the willing servant of the laws 
 meg what laws do you mean 
 ath in the first place let us speak of the laws about to say such music as then order that we may trace thegrowth of the excess of freedom from the beginning now music wasearly divided among us into certain kinds and manners one sortconsisted of prayers to the gods which were called hymns and therewas another and opposite sort called lamentations and anothertermed paeans and another celebrating the birth of dionysus believe dithyrambs and they used the actual word laws ornomoi for another kind of song and to this they added the all these and others were duly distinguished norwere the performers allowed to confuse one style of music withanother and the authority which determined and gave judgment andpunished the disobedient was not expressed in a hiss nor in the mostunmusical shouts of the multitude as in our days nor in applause andclapping of hands but the directors of public instruction insistedthat the spectators should listen in silence to the end and boysand their tutors and the multitude in general were kept quiet by ahint from a stick such was the good order which the multitude werewilling to observe they would never have dared to give judgment bynoisy cries and then as time went on the poets themselvesintroduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation they were menof genius but they had no perception of what is just and lawful inmusic raging like bacchanals and possessed with lamentations with hymns and paeans with the sounds of the flute on the lyre and making onegeneral confusion ignorantly affirming that music has no whether good or bad can only be judged of rightly by thepleasure of the hearer and by composing such licentious works andadding to them words as licentious they have inspired the multitudewith lawlessness and boldness and made them fancy that they can judgefor themselves about melody and song and in this way the theatresfrom being mute have become vocal as though they had understanding ofgood and bad in music and poetry and instead of an aristocracy anevil sort of theatrocracy has grown up for if the democracy whichjudged had only consisted of educated persons no fatal harm wouldhave been done but in music there first arose the universal conceitof omniscience and general came followingafterwards and men fancying that they knew what they did not no longer any fear and the absence of fear begetsshamelessness for what is this shamelessness which is so evil athing but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the better byreason of an sort of liberty 
 meg very true 
 ath consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom ofdisobedience to rulers and then the attempt to escape the control andexhortation of father mother elders and when near the end thecontrol of the laws also and at the very end there is the contempt ofoaths and pledges and no regard at all for the theyexhibit and imitate the old so called titanic nature and come tothe same point as the titans when they rebelled against god leading alife of endless evils but why have i said all this i ask becausethe argument ought to be pulled up from time to time and not beallowed to run away but held with bit and bridle and then we shallnot as the proverb says fall off our ass let us then once moreask the question to what end has all this been said 
 meg very good 
 ath this then has been said for the sake 
 meg of what 
 ath we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have threethings in view first that the city for which he legislates should befree and secondly be at unity with herself and thirdly should were our principles were they not 
 meg certainly 
 ath with a view to this we selected two kinds of government thedespotic and the other the most free and now we are consideringwhich of them is the right form we took a mean in both cases ofdespotism in the one and of liberty in the other and we saw thatin a mean they attained their perfection but that when they werecarried to the extreme of either slavery or licence neither partywere the gainers 
 meg very true 
 ath and that was our reason for considering the settlement of thedorian army and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of themountains and the removal of cities to the seashore and of ourmention of the first men who were the survivors of the deluge andall that was previously said about music and drinking and whatpreceded was said with the view of seeing how a state might be bestadministered and how an individual might best order his own life andnow megillus and cleinias how can we put to the proof the value ofour words 
 cle stranger i think that i see how a proof of their value maybe obtained this discussion of ours appears to me to have beensingularly fortunate and just what i at this moment want mostauspiciously have you and my friend megillus come in my way for iwill tell you what has happened to me and i regard the coincidence asa sort of omen the greater part of crete is going to send out acolony and they have entrusted the management of the affair to thecnosians and the cnosian government to me and nine others and theydesire us to give them any laws which we please whether taken fromthe cretan model or from any other and they do not mind about theirbeing foreign if they are better grant me then this favour whichwill also be a gain to us make a selection from whathas been said and then let us imagine a state of which we willsuppose ourselves to be the original founders thus we shall proceedwith our enquiry and at the same time i may have the use of theframework which you are constructing for the city which is incontemplation 
 ath good news cleinias if megillus has no objection you maybe sure that i will do all in my power to please you 
 cle thank you 
 meg and so will i 
 cle excellent and now let us begin to frame the state

 book iii 
 
 athenian stranger enough of this and what then is to be regardedas the origin of government will not a man be able to judge of itbest from a point of view in which he may behold the progress ofstates and their transitions to good or evil 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 ath i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages 
 cle how so 
 ath why do you think that you can reckon the time which haselapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them 
 cle hardly 
 ath but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and have not thousands and thousands of cities come intobeing during this period and as many perished and has not each ofthem had every form of government many times over now growing smaller and again improving or declining 
 cle to be sure 
 ath let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes forthat will probably explain the first origin and development of formsof government 
 cle very good you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to we will make an effort to understand you 
 ath do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions 
 cle what traditions 
 ath the traditions about the many destructions of mankind whichhave been occasioned by deluges and pestilences and in many otherways and of the survival of a remnant 
 cle every one is disposed to believe them 
 ath let us consider one of them that which was caused by thefamous deluge 
 cle what are we to observe about it 
 ath i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be sparks of the human race preserved on the tops ofmountains 
 cle clearly 
 ath such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with thearts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers incities by interest or ambition and with all the wrongs which theycontrive against one another 
 cle very true 
 ath let us suppose then that the cities in the plain and on were utterly destroyed at that time 
 cle very good 
 ath would not all implements have then perished and every otherexcellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom haveutterly disappeared 
 cle why yes my friend and if things had always continued as theyare at present ordered how could any discovery have ever been madeeven in the least particular for it is evident that the arts wereunknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years and no more thana thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries ofdaedalus orpheus and marsyas and olympus inventedmusic and amphion the to speak of numberless otherinventions which are but of yesterday 
 ath have you forgotten cleinias the name of a friend who isreally of yesterday 
 cle i suppose that you mean epimenides 
 ath the same my friend he does indeed far overleap the heads ofall mankind by his invention for he carried out in practice as youdeclare what of old hesiod only preached 
 cle yes according to our tradition 
 ath after the great destruction may we not suppose that thestate of man was something of this the beginning of thingsthere was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land aherd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal there might be a few goats these too hardly enough to maintainthe shepherds who tended them 
 cle true 
 ath and of cities or governments or legislation about which we arenow talking do you suppose that they could have any recollection atall 
 cle none whatever 
 ath and out of this state of things has there not sprung all thatwe now are and have cities and governments and arts and laws anda great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath why my good friend how can we possibly suppose that those whoknew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attainedtheir full development whether of virtue or of vice 
 cle i understand your meaning and you are quite right 
 ath but as time advanced and the race multiplied the world cameto be what the world is 
 cle very true 
 ath doubtless the change was not made all in a moment but littleby little during a very long period of time 
 cle a highly probable supposition 
 ath at first they would have a natural fear ringing in theirears which would prevent their descending from the heights into theplain 
 cle of course 
 ath the fewness of the survivors at that time would have madethem all the more desirous of seeing one another but then the meansof travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely i may say with the loss of the arts and there was greatdifficulty in getting at one another for iron and brass and allmetals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos nor wasthere any possibility of extracting ore from them and they hadscarcely any means of felling timber even if you suppose that someimplements might have been preserved in the mountains they mustquickly have worn out and vanished and there would be no more of themuntil the art of metallurgy had again revived 
 cle there could not have been 
 ath in how many generations would this be attained 
 cle clearly not for many generations 
 ath during this period and for some time afterwards all thearts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear 
 cle certainly 
 ath faction and war would also have died out in those days and formany reasons 
 cle how would that be 
 ath in the first place the desolation of these primitive men wouldcreate in them a feeling of affection and towards oneanother and secondly they would have no occasion to quarrel abouttheir subsistence for they would have pasture in abundance exceptjust at first and in some particular cases and from they would obtain the greater part of their food in aprimitive age having plenty of milk and flesh moreover they wouldprocure other food by the chase not to be despised either in quantityor quality they would also have abundance of clothing and dwellings and utensils either capable of standing on the fireor not for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use ofiron and god has given these two arts to man in order to providehim with all such things that when reduced to the last human race may still grow and increase hence in those daysmankind were not very poor nor was poverty a cause of differenceamong them and rich they could not have been having neither gold at that time was their condition and the community whichhas neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblestprinciples in it there is no insolence or injustice nor there any contentions or envyings and therefore they were also because they were what is called and when theywere told about good and evil they in their simplicity believedwhat they heard to be very truth and practised it no one had thewit to suspect another of a falsehood as men do now but what theyheard about gods and men they believed to be true and livedaccordingly and therefore they were in all respects such as we havedescribed them 
 cle that quite accords with my views and with those of my friendhere 
 ath would not many generations living on in a simple ruder perhaps and more ignorant of the arts in particular of those of land or naval warfare and likewise ofother arts termed in cities legal practices and party including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in wordand inferior to those who lived before the deluge orto the men of our day in these respects would they not i say besimpler and more manly and also more temperate and altogether morejust the reason has been already explained 
 cle very true 
 ath i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and whatis about to follow has been and will be said with the intentionof explaining what need the men of that time had of laws and whowas their lawgiver 
 cle and thus far what you have said has been very well said 
 ath they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet nothing of thatsort was likely to have existed in their days for they had no lettersat this early period they lived by habit and the customs of theirancestors as they are called 
 cle probably 
 ath but there was already existing a form of government which if iam not mistaken is generally termed a lordship and this stillremains in many places both among hellenes and barbarians and is thegovernment which is declared by homer to have prevailed among thecyclopes 
 they have neither councils nor judgments but they dwell in hollowcaves on the tops of high mountains and every one gives law to hiswife and children and they do not busy themselves about one another 
 cle that seems to be a charming poet of yours i have read someother verses of his which are very clever but i do not know muchof him for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans 
 megillus but they are in lacedaemon and he appears to be theprince of them all the manner of life however which he describes isnot spartan but rather ionian and he seems quite to confirm what youare saying when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the helpof tradition to barbarism 
 ath yes he does confirm it and we may accept his witness to thefact that such forms of government sometimes arise 
 cle we may 
 ath and were not such states composed of men who had been dispersedin single habitations and families by the poverty which attended thedevastations and did not the eldest then rule among them becausewith them government originated in the authority of a father and amother whom like a flock of birds they followed forming onetroop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their of all sovereignties is the most just 
 cle very true 
 ath after this they came together in greater numbers and increasedthe size of their cities and betook themselves to husbandry first ofall at the foot of the mountains and made enclosures of loose wallsand works of defence in order to keep off wild beasts thuscreating a single large and common habitation 
 cle yes at least we may suppose so 
 ath there is another thing which would probably happen 
 cle what 
 ath when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesseroriginal ones each of the lesser ones would survive in the family would be under the rule of the eldest and owing totheir separation from one another would have peculiar customs inthings divine and human which they would have received from theirseveral parents who had educated them and these customs would inclinethem to order when the parents had the element of order in theirnature and to courage when they had the element of courage and theywould naturally stamp upon their children and upon their their own likings and as we are saying they would findtheir way into the larger society having already their own peculiarlaws 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every man surely likes his own laws best and the laws ofothers not so well 
 cle true 
 ath then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings oflegislation 
 cle exactly 
 ath the next step will be that these persons who have met select some arbiters who will review the laws of all of will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs wholead the tribes and who are in a manner their kings allowing them tochoose those which they think best these persons will themselves becalled legislators and will appoint the magistrates framing somesort of aristocracy or perhaps monarchy out of the dynasties orlordships and in this altered state of the government they will live 
 cle yes that would be the natural order of things 
 ath then now let us speak of a third form of government inwhich all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur 
 cle what is that 
 ath the form which in fact homer indicates as following the third form arose when as he says dardanus founded dardania 
 for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be acity of speaking men but they were still dwelling at the foot indeed in these verses and in what he said of the cyclopes hespeaks the words of god and nature for poets are a divine race andoften in their strains by the aid of the muses and the graces theyattain truth 
 cle yes 
 ath then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale which willprobably be found to illustrate in some degree our we do so 
 cle by all means 
 ath ilium was built when they descended from the mountain in alarge and fair plain on a sort of low hill watered by many riversdescending from ida 
 cle such is the tradition 
 ath and we must suppose this event to have taken place many agesafter the deluge 
 ath a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction wouldappear to have come over them when they placed their town right undernumerous streams flowing from the heights trusting for their securityto not very high hills either 
 cle there must have been a long interval clearly 
 ath and as population increased many other cities would beginto be inhabited 
 cle doubtless 
 ath those cities made war against sea as well as that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea 
 cle clearly 
 ath the achaeans remained ten years and overthrew troy 
 cle true 
 ath and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besiegingilium the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil youth revolted and when the soldiers returned to their owncities and families they did not receive them properly and as theyought to have done and numerous deaths murders exiles were theconsequence the exiles came again under a new name no longerachaeans but name which they derived from dorieus for itwas he who gathered them together the rest of the story is told byyou lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta 
 meg to be sure 
 ath thus after digressing from the original subject of laws intomusic and the argument has providentially comeback to the same point and presents to us another handle for we havereached the settlement of lacedaemon which as you truly say is inlaws and in institutions the sister of crete and we are all thebetter for the digression because we have gone through variousgovernments and settlements and have been present at the foundationof a first second and third state succeeding one another ininfinite time and now there appears on the horizon a fourth stateor nation which was once in process of settlement and has continuedsettled to this day if out of all this we are able to discernwhat is well or ill settled and what laws are the salvation andwhat are the destruction of cities and what changes would make astate happy o megillus and cleinias we may now begin again unlesswe have some fault to find with the previous discussion 
 meg if some god stranger would promise us that our new enquiryabout legislation would be as good and full as the present i would goa great way to hear such another and would think that a day as longas we are now approaching the longest day of the tooshort for the discussion 
 ath then i suppose that we must consider this subject 
 meg certainly 
 ath let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when lacedaemonand argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were all incomplete subjection megillus to your ancestors for afterwards asthe legend informs us they divided their army into three settled three cities argos messene lacedaemon 
 meg true 
 ath temenus was the king of argos cresphontes of and eurysthenes of lacedaemon 
 meg certainly 
 ath to these kings all the men of that day made oath that theywould assist them if any one subverted their kingdom 
 meg true 
 ath but can a kingship be destroyed or was any other form ofgovernment ever destroyed by any but the rulers themselves noindeed by zeus have we already forgotten what was said a littlewhile ago 
 meg no 
 ath and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned forwe have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the sameprinciple so that in resuming the discussion we shall not beenquiring about an empty theory but about events which actuallyhappened the case was as royal heroes made oath tothree cities which were under a kingly government and the cities tothe kings that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governedaccording to the laws which were common to all of them the rulerspromised that as time and the race went forward they would not maketheir rule more arbitrary and the subjects said that if the rulersobserved these conditions they would never subvert or permit othersto subvert those kingdoms the kings were to assist kings andpeoples when injured and the peoples were to assist peoples and kingsin like manner is not this the fact 
 meg yes 
 ath and the three states to whom these laws were given whethertheir kings or any others were the authors of them had thereforethe greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions 
 meg what security 
 ath that the other two states were always to come to the rescueagainst a rebellious third 
 meg true 
 ath many persons say that legislators ought to impose such lawsas the mass of the people will be ready to receive but this is justas if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treator cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner 
 meg exactly 
 ath whereas the physician may often be too happy if he canrestore health and make the body whole without any very greatinfliction of pain 
 meg certainly 
 ath there was also another advantage possessed by the men of thatday which greatly lightened the task of passing laws 
 meg what advantage 
 ath the legislators of that day when they equalized the great accusation which generally arises in legislation ifa person attempts to disturb the possession of land or to abolishdebts because he sees that without this reform there can never be anyreal equality now in general when the legislator attempts to make anew settlement of such matters every one meets him with the cry is not to disturb vested with imprecationsthat he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts untila man is at his wits end whereas no one could quarrel with thedorians for distributing the was nothing to hinder as for debts they had none which were considerable or of oldstanding 
 meg very true 
 ath but then my good friends why did the settlement andlegislation of their country turn out so badly 
 meg how do you mean and why do you blame them 
 ath there were three kingdoms and of these two quicklycorrupted their original constitution and laws and the only one whichremained was the spartan 
 meg the question which you ask is not easily answered 
 ath and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws thisbeing our old sober game of play whereby we beguile the way asi was saying when we first set out on our journey 
 meg certainly and we must find out why this was 
 ath what laws are more worthy of our attention than those whichhave regulated such cities or what settlements of states aregreater or more famous 
 meg i know of none 
 ath can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutionsnot only for the protection of peloponnesus but of all thehellenes in case they were attacked by the barbarian for theinhabitants of the region about ilium when they provoked by theirinsolence the trojan war relied upon the power of the assyrians andthe empire of ninus which still existed and had a great prestige thepeople of those days fearing the united assyrian empire just as we nowfear the great king and the second capture of troy was a seriousoffence against them because troy was a portion of the assyrianempire to meet the danger the single army was distributed betweenthree cities by the royal brothers sons of fair device asit seemed and a far better arrangement than the expedition againsttroy for firstly the people of that day had as they thought inthe heraclidae better leaders than the pelopidae in the next considered that their army was superior in valour to that whichwent against troy for although the latter conquered the were themselves conquered by the bydorians may we not suppose that this was the intention with which themen of those days framed the constitutions of their states 
 meg quite true 
 ath and would not men who had shared with one another many were governed by a single race of royal brothers and had takenthe advice of oracles and in particular of the delphian apollo belikely to think that such states would be firmly and lastinglyestablished 
 meg of course they would 
 ath yet these institutions of which such great expectations wereentertained seem to have all rapidly vanished away with theexception as i was saying of that small part of them which existedin this third part has never to this day ceased warringagainst the two others whereas if the original idea had been carriedout and they had agreed to be one their power would have beeninvincible in war 
 meg no doubt 
 ath but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy here is asubject well worthy of consideration 
 meg certainly no one will ever find more striking instances oflaws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great andnoble interests than are here presented to his view 
 ath then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real andimportant question 
 meg very true 
 ath did you never remark sage friend that all men and weourselves at this moment often fancy that they see some beautifulthing which might have effected wonders if any one had only knownhow to make a right use of it in some way and yet this mode oflooking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake and notaccording to nature either in our own case or in any other 
 meg to what are you referring and what do you mean 
 ath i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaidheracleid expedition which was so noble and might have had suchwonderful results for the hellenes if only rightly used and i wasjust laughing at myself 
 meg but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did andwe in assenting to you 
 ath perhaps and yet i cannot help observing that any one whosees anything great or powerful immediately has the the owner only knew how to use his great and noblepossession how happy would he be and what great results would heachieve 
 meg and would he not be justified 
 ath reflect in what point of view does this sort of praiseappear just first in reference to the question in thethen commanders had known how to arrange their army properly howwould they have attained success would not this have been the would have bound them all firmly together and preserved themfor ever giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure combinedwith the power of doing in the whole world hellenic and they and their descendants desired what other aim would theyhave had 
 meg very good 
 ath suppose any one were in the same way to express hisadmiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour or the would praise them under the idea that through them he wouldattain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires 
 meg he would 
 ath well now and does not the argument show that there is onecommon desire of all mankind 
 meg what is it 
 ath the desire which a man has that all things if anyrate things come to pass in accordance with his 
 meg certainly 
 ath and having this desire always and at every time of life inyouth in manhood in age he cannot help always praying for thefulfilment of it 
 meg no doubt 
 ath and we join in the prayers of our friends and ask for themwhat they ask for themselves 
 meg we do 
 ath dear is the son to the younger to the elder 
 meg of course 
 ath and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the fatherprays that he may not obtain 
 meg when the son is young and foolish you mean 
 ath yes or when the father in the dotage of age or the heat ofyouth having no sense of right and justice prays with fervour underthe influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursedthe unfortunate hippolytus do you imagine that the son having asense of right and justice will join in his prayers 
 meg i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or bein a hurry to have all things according to his wish for his wishmay be at variance with his reason but every state and everyindividual ought to pray and strive for wisdom 
 ath yes and i remember and you will remember what i said atfirst that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with aview to wisdom while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought toorder all with a view to war and to this i replied that there werefour virtues but that upon your view one of them only was the aimof legislation whereas you ought to regard all virtue and especiallythat which comes first and is the leader of all the meanwisdom and mind and opinion having affection and desire in theirtrain and now the argument returns to the same point and i sayonce more in jest if you like or in earnest if you like that theprayer of a fool is full of danger being likely to end in theopposite of what he desires and if you would rather receive mywords in earnest i am willing that you should and you will find isuspect as i have said already that not cowardice was the cause ofthe ruin of the dorian kings and of their whole design norignorance of military matters either on the part of the rulers orof their subjects but their misfortunes were due to their generaldegeneracy and especially to their ignorance of the most importanthuman affairs that was then and is still and always will be thecase as i will endeavour if you will allow me to make out anddemonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends in thecourse of the argument 
 cle pray go on are troublesome but wewill show not in word but in deed how greatly we prize your we will give them our best attention and that is the way in whicha freeman best shows his approval or disapproval 
 meg excellent cleinias let us do as you say 
 cle by all means if heaven wills go on 
 ath well then proceeding in the same train of thought i say thatthe greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power and that then ignorance is ruin and if this be true the legislator mustendeavour to implant wisdom in states and banish ignorance to theutmost of his power 
 cle that is evident 
 ath then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance ishould like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me inwhat i am about to say for my opinion is 
 cle what 
 ath that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which henevertheless thinks to be good and noble and loves and embracesthat which he knows to be unrighteous and evil this disagreementbetween the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soulis in my opinion the worst ignorance and also the greatest becauseaffecting the great mass of the human soul for the principle whichfeels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populacein a state and when the soul is opposed to knowledge or reason which are her natural lords that i call folly just asin the state when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers andthe laws or again in the individual when fair reasonings havetheir habitation in the soul and yet do no good but rather thereverse of good all these cases i term the worst ignorance whetherin individuals or in states you will understand stranger that iam speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance ofhandicraftsmen 
 cle yes my friend we understand and agree 
 ath let us then in the first place declare and affirm that thecitizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind ofauthority entrusted to him he must be stigmatized as ignorant eventhough he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts ofaccomplishments and feats of mental dexterity and the opposite areto be called wise even although in the words of the proverb theyknow neither how to read nor how to swim and to them as to men ofsense authority is to be committed for o my friends how canthere be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony there isnone but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said tobe the greatest wisdom and of this he is a partaker who livesaccording to reason whereas he who is devoid of reason is thedestroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of thestate he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom let this i was saying be laid down by us 
 cle let it be so laid down 
 ath i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what are the principles on which men rule and obey incities whether great or small and similarly in families what arethey and how many in number is there not one claim of authoritywhich is always of fathers and mothers and in general ofprogenitors to rule over their offspring 
 cle there is 
 ath next follows the principle that the noble should rule overthe ignoble and thirdly that the elder should rule and theyounger obey 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and fourthly that slaves should be ruled and their mastersrule 
 cle of course 
 ath fifthly if i am not mistaken comes the principle that thestronger shall rule and the weaker be ruled 
 cle that is a rule not to be disobeyed 
 ath yes and a rule which prevails very widely among all is according to nature as the theban poet pindar once said andthe sixth principle and the greatest of all is that the wise shouldlead and command and the ignorant follow and obey and yet o thoumost wise pindar as i should reply him this surely is not contraryto nature but according to nature being the rule of law over willingsubjects and not a rule of compulsion 
 cle most true 
 ath there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot and isdear to the gods and a token of good fortune he on whom the lot fallsis a ruler and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is thesubject and this we affirm to be quite just 
 cle certainly 
 ath then now as we say playfully to any of those who lightlyundertake the making of laws you see legislator the principlesof government how many they are and that they are naturallyopposed to each other there we have discovered a ofseditions to which you must attend and first we will ask you toconsider with us how and in what respect the kings of argos andmessene violated these our maxims and ruined themselves and the greatand famous hellenic power of the olden time was it because they didnot know how wisely hesiod spoke when he said that the half is oftenmore than the whole his meaning was that when to take the wholewould be dangerous and to take the half would be the safe andmoderate course then the moderate or better was more than theimmoderate or worse 
 cle very true 
 ath and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal whenfound among kings than when among peoples 
 cle the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especiallyprevalent among kings because they lead a proud and luxurious life 
 ath is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that timewas to get the better of the established laws and that they werenot in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe byword and oath this want of harmony may have had the appearance ofwisdom but was really as we assert the greatest ignorance andutterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord 
 cle very likely 
 ath good and what measures ought the legislator to have then takenin order to avert this calamity truly there is no great wisdom inknowing and no great difficulty in telling after the evil hashappened but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have takena much wiser head than ours 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath any one who looks at what has occurred with you may easily know and may easily say what ought to have beendone at that time 
 meg speak a little more clearly 
 ath nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about tomake 
 meg what is it 
 ath that if any one gives too great a power to anything toolarge a sail to a vessel too much food to the body too muchauthority to the mind and does not observe the mean everything isoverthrown and in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case todisorders and in the other to injustice which is the child ofexcess i mean to say my dear friends that there is no soul ofman young and irresponsible who will be able to sustain thetemptation of arbitrary one who will not under suchcircumstances become filled with folly that worst of diseases andbe hated by his nearest and dearest friends when this happens hiskingdom is undermined and all his power vanishes from him andgreat legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger asfar as we can guess at this distance of time what happened was asfollows 
 meg what 
 ath a god who watched over sparta seeing into the future gaveyou two families of kings instead of one and thus brought you morewithin the limits of moderation in the next place some humanwisdom mingled with divine power observing that the constitution ofyour government was still feverish and excited tempered your inbornstrength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of the power of your elders equal with that of thekings in the most important matters but your third that your government was still swelling and foaming anddesirous to impose a curb upon it instituted the ephors whosepower he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot and bythis arrangement the kingly office being compounded of the rightelements and duly moderated was preserved and was the means ofpreserving all the rest since if there had been only the originallegislators temenus cresphontes and their contemporaries as far asthey were concerned not even the portion of aristodemus would havebeen preserved for they had no proper experience in legislation orthey would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate ayouthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted intoa tyranny now that god has instructed us what sort of governmentwould have been or will be lasting there is no wisdom as i havealready said in judging after the event there is no difficulty inlearning from an example which has already occurred but if any onecould have foreseen all this at the time and had been able tomoderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into might have saved all the excellent institutions which were thenconceived and no persian or any other armament would have dared toattack us or would have regarded hellas as a power to be despised 
 cle true 
 ath there was small credit to us cleinias in defeating the discredit was not that the conquerors did not win gloriousvictories both by land and sea but what in my opinion broughtdiscredit was first of all the circumstance that of the three citiesone only fought on behalf of hellas and the two others were soutterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty waragainst lacedaemon and was thus preventing her from renderingassistance while the city of argos which had the precedence at thetime of the distribution when asked to aid in repelling thebarbarian would not answer to the call or give aid many thingsmight be told about hellas in connection with that war which are farfrom honourable nor indeed can we rightly say that hellasrepelled the invader for the truth is that unless the atheniansand lacedaemonians acting in concert had warded off the impendingyoke all the tribes of hellas would have been fused in a chaos ofhellenes mingling with one another of barbarians mingling withhellenes and hellenes with barbarians just as nations who are nowsubject to the persian power owing to unnatural separations andcombinations of them are dispersed and scattered and live cleinias and megillus are the reproaches which we have to makeagainst statesmen and legislators as they are called past andpresent if we would analyse the causes of their failure and find outwhat else might have been done we said for instance just there ought to be no great and unmixed powers and this was underthe idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious andthat a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end nor isthere any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims forthe legislator which appear not to be always the same but we shouldconsider when we say that temperance is to be the aim or wisdom is tobe the aim or friendship is to be the aim that all these aims arereally the same and if so a variety in the modes of expression oughtnot to disturb us 
 cle let us resume the argument in that spirit and now speaking offriendship and wisdom and freedom i wish that you would tell me atwhat in your opinion the legislator should aim 
 ath hear me then there are two mother forms of states fromwhich the rest may be truly said to be derived and one of them may becalled monarchy and the other democracy the persians have the highestform of the one and we of the other almost all the rest as i wassaying are variations of these now if you are to have liberty andthe combination of friendship with wisdom you must have both theseforms of government in a measure the argument emphatically declaresthat no city can be well governed which is not made up of both 
 cle impossible 
 ath neither the one if it be exclusively and excessivelyattached to monarchy nor the other if it be similarly attached tofreedom observes moderation but your states the laconian andcretan have more of it and the same was the case with theathenians and persians of old time but now they have less shall itell you why 
 cle by all means if it will tend to elucidate our subject 
 ath hear was a time when the persians had more ofthe state which is a mean between slavery and freedom in the reign ofcyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others the rulers gavea share of freedom to the subjects and being treated as equals thesoldiers were on better terms with their generals and showedthemselves more ready in the hour of danger and if there was any wiseman among them who was able to give good counsel he imparted hiswisdom to the public for the king was not jealous but allowed himfull liberty of speech and gave honour to those who could advisehim in any matter and the nation waxed in all respects because therewas freedom and friendship and communion of mind among them 
 cle that certainly appears to have been the case 
 ath how then was this advantage lost under cambyses and againrecovered under darius shall i try to divine 
 cle the enquiry no doubt has a bearing upon our subject 
 ath i imagine that cyrus though a great and patriotic general hadnever given his mind to education and never attended to the orderof his household 
 cle what makes you say so 
 ath i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier andentrusted the education of his children to the women and they broughtthem up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune who wereblessed already and needed no more blessings they thought thatthey were happy enough and that no one should be allowed to opposethem in any way and they compelled every one to praise all thatthey said or did this was how they brought them up 
 cle a splendid education truly 
 ath such an one as women were likely to give them and especiallyprincesses who had recently grown rich and in the absence of the who were occupied in wars and dangers and had no time to lookafter them 
 cle what would you expect 
 ath their father had possessions of cattle and sheep and manyherds of men and other animals but he did not consider that thoseto whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his owncalling which was persian for the persians are of arugged land which is a stern mother and well fitted to producesturdy race able to live in the open air and go without sleep andalso to fight if fighting is required he did not observe that hissons were trained differently through the blessing of beingroyal they were educated in the median fashion by women and led to their becoming such as people do become when they arebrought up unreproved and so after the death of cyrus his the fulness of luxury and licence took the kingdom and firstone slew the other because he could not endure a rival the slayer himself mad with wine and brutality losthis kingdom through the medes and the eunuch as they called despised the folly of cambyses 
 cle so runs the tale and such probably were the facts 
 ath yes and the tradition says that the empire came back to thepersians through darius and the seven chiefs 
 cle true 
 ath let us note the rest of the story observe that darius was notthe son of a king and had not received a luxurious education when hecame to the throne being one of the seven he divided the countryinto seven portions and of this arrangement there are some shadowytraces still remaining he made laws upon the principle of introducinguniversal equality in the order of the state and he embodied in hislaws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus a feeling of friendship and community among all the attaching the people to him with money and gifts hence his armiescheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrushad left behind him darius was succeeded by his son xerxes and heagain was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion might wenot most justly say o darius how came you to bring up xerxes in thesame way in which cyrus brought up cambyses and not to see hisfatal mistake for xerxes being the creation of the sameeducation met with much the same fortune as cambyses and from thattime until now there has never been a really great king among thepersians although they are all called great and their degeneracyis not to be attributed to chance as i maintain the reason is ratherthe evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich androyal persons for never will boy or man young or old excel invirtue who has been thus educated and this i say is what thelegislator has to consider and what at the present moment has to beconsidered by us justly may you o lacedaemonians be praised inthat you do not give special honour or a special education to wealthrather than to poverty or to a royal rather than to a privatestation where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originallycommanded them to be given for no man ought to have in a state because he surpasses others in wealth any more thanbecause he is swift of foot or fair or strong unless he have somevirtue in him nor even if he have virtue unless he have thisparticular virtue of temperance 
 meg what do you mean stranger 
 ath i suppose that courage is a part of virtue 
 meg to be sure 
 ath then now hear and judge for you like to havefor a or neighbour a very courageous man who had nocontrol over himself 
 meg heaven forbid 
 ath or an artist who was clever in his profession but a rogue 
 meg certainly not 
 ath and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance 
 meg impossible 
 ath any more than our pattern wise man whom we exhibited as havinghis pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to truereason can be intemperate 
 meg no 
 ath there is a further consideration relating to the due andundue award of honours in states 
 meg what is it 
 ath i should like to know whether temperance without the othervirtues existing alone in the soul of man is rightly to be praisedor blamed 
 meg i cannot tell 
 ath and that is the best answer for whichever alternative youhad chosen i think that you would have gone wrong 
 meg i am fortunate 
 ath very good a quality which is a mere appendage of things whichcan be praised or blamed does not deserve an expression of is best passed over in silence 
 meg you are speaking of temperance 
 ath yes but of the other virtues that which having this appendageis also most beneficial will be most deserving of honour and nextthat which is beneficial in the next degree and so each of themwill be rightly honoured according to a regular order 
 meg true 
 ath and ought not the legislator to determine these classes 
 meg certainly he should 
 ath suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details butthe general division of laws according to their importance into afirst and second and third class we who are lovers of law may makeourselves 
 meg very good 
 ath we maintain then that a state which would be safe andhappy as far as the nature of man allows must and ought todistribute honour and dishonour in the right way and the right way isto place the goods of the soul first and highest in the assuming temperance to be the condition of them and toassign the second place to the goods of the body and the thirdplace to money and property and it any legislator or state departsfrom this rule by giving money the place of honour or in any waypreferring that which is really last may we not say that he or thestate is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing 
 meg yes let that be plainly declared 
 ath the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far toenlarge we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse and weaffirm the reason of this to have been that they too muchdiminished the freedom of the people and introduced too much ofdespotism and so destroyed friendship and community of feeling andwhen there is an end of these no longer do the governors govern onbehalf of their subjects or of the people but on behalf ofthemselves and if they think that they can gain ever so small anadvantage for themselves they devastate cities and send fire anddesolation among friendly races and as they hate ruthlessly andhorribly so are they hated and when they want the people to fightfor them they find no community of feeling or willingness to risktheir lives on their behalf their untold myriads are useless tothem on the field of battle and they think that their salvationdepends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they if they were in want of more men and they cannot help beingstupid since they proclaim by actions that the ordinarydistinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are atrifle when compared with gold and silver 
 meg quite true 
 ath and now enough of the persians and their presentmaladministration of their government which is owing to the excess ofslavery and despotism among them 
 meg good 
 ath next we must pass in review the government of attica in likemanner and from this show that entire freedom and the absence ofall superior authority is not by any means so good as government byothers when properly limited which was our ancient athenianconstitution at the time when the persians made their attack onhellas or speaking more correctly on the whole continent of were four classes arranged according to a property reverence was our queen and mistress and made us willing tolive in obedience to the laws which then prevailed also thevastness of the persian armament both by sea and on land caused ahelpless terror which made us more and more the servants of ourrulers and of the laws and for all these reasons an exceeding harmonyprevailed among us about ten years before the naval engagement atsalamis datis came leading a persian host by command of was expressly directed against the athenians and orders to carry them away captive and these orders he was toexecute under pain of death now datis and his myriads soon becamecomplete masters of eretria and he sent a fearful report to athensthat no eretrian had escaped him for the soldiers of datis had joinedhands and netted the whole of eretria and this report whether wellor ill founded was terrible to all the hellenes and above all to theathenians and they dispatched embassies in all directions but no onewas willing to come to their relief with the exception of thelacedaemonians and they either because they were detained by themessenian war which was then going on or for some other reason ofwhich we are not told came a day too late for the battle of a while the news arrived of mighty preparations being made andinnumerable threats came from the king then as time went on arumour reached us that darius had died and that his son who wasyoung and had come to the throne and was persisting in hisdesign the athenians were under the impression that the wholeexpedition was directed against them in consequence of the battleof marathon and hearing of the bridge over the hellespont and thecanal of athos and the host of ships considering that there was nosalvation for them either by land or by sea for there was no one tohelp them and remembering that in the first expedition when thepersians destroyed eretria no one came to their help or would riskthe danger of an alliance with them they thought that this wouldhappen again at least on land nor when they looked to the they descry any hope of salvation for they were attacked by athousand vessels and more one chance of safety remained slightindeed and desperate but their only one they saw that on theformer occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible victory andborne up by this hope they found that their only refuge was inthemselves and in the gods all these things created in them thespirit of friendship there was the fear of the moment and therewas that higher fear which they had acquired by obedience to theirancient laws and which i have several times in the precedingdiscourse called reverence of which the good man ought to be awilling servant and of which the coward is independent andfearless if this fear had not possessed them they would never havemet the enemy or defended their temples and sepulchres and theircountry and everything that was near and dear to them as they little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed 
 meg your words athenian are quite true and worthy of yourselfand of your country 
 ath they are true megillus and to you who have inherited thevirtues of your ancestors i may properly speak of the actions of thatday and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my wordshave not also a bearing on legislation for i am not discoursingonly for the pleasure of talking but for the to remark that the experience both of ourselves and thepersians was in a certain sense the same for as they led theirpeople into utter servitude so we too led ours into all now how shall we proceed for i would like you to observe thatour previous arguments have good deal to say for themselves 
 meg true but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation 
 ath i will under the ancient laws my friends the people wasnot as now the master but rather the willing servant of the laws 
 meg what laws do you mean 
 ath in the first place let us speak of the laws about to say such music as then order that we may trace thegrowth of the excess of freedom from the beginning now music wasearly divided among us into certain kinds and manners one sortconsisted of prayers to the gods which were called hymns and therewas another and opposite sort called lamentations and anothertermed paeans and another celebrating the birth of dionysus believe dithyrambs and they used the actual word laws ornomoi for another kind of song and to this they added the all these and others were duly distinguished norwere the performers allowed to confuse one style of music withanother and the authority which determined and gave judgment andpunished the disobedient was not expressed in a hiss nor in the mostunmusical shouts of the multitude as in our days nor in applause andclapping of hands but the directors of public instruction insistedthat the spectators should listen in silence to the end and boysand their tutors and the multitude in general were kept quiet by ahint from a stick such was the good order which the multitude werewilling to observe they would never have dared to give judgment bynoisy cries and then as time went on the poets themselvesintroduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation they were menof genius but they had no perception of what is just and lawful inmusic raging like bacchanals and possessed with lamentations with hymns and paeans with the sounds of the flute on the lyre and making onegeneral confusion ignorantly affirming that music has no whether good or bad can only be judged of rightly by thepleasure of the hearer and by composing such licentious works andadding to them words as licentious they have inspired the multitudewith lawlessness and boldness and made them fancy that they can judgefor themselves about melody and song and in this way the theatresfrom being mute have become vocal as though they had understanding ofgood and bad in music and poetry and instead of an aristocracy anevil sort of theatrocracy has grown up for if the democracy whichjudged had only consisted of educated persons no fatal harm wouldhave been done but in music there first arose the universal conceitof omniscience and general came followingafterwards and men fancying that they knew what they did not no longer any fear and the absence of fear begetsshamelessness for what is this shamelessness which is so evil athing but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the better byreason of an sort of liberty 
 meg very true 
 ath consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom ofdisobedience to rulers and then the attempt to escape the control andexhortation of father mother elders and when near the end thecontrol of the laws also and at the very end there is the contempt ofoaths and pledges and no regard at all for the theyexhibit and imitate the old so called titanic nature and come tothe same point as the titans when they rebelled against god leading alife of endless evils but why have i said all this i ask becausethe argument ought to be pulled up from time to time and not beallowed to run away but held with bit and bridle and then we shallnot as the proverb says fall off our ass let us then once moreask the question to what end has all this been said 
 meg very good 
 ath this then has been said for the sake 
 meg of what 
 ath we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have threethings in view first that the city for which he legislates should befree and secondly be at unity with herself and thirdly should were our principles were they not 
 meg certainly 
 ath with a view to this we selected two kinds of government thedespotic and the other the most free and now we are consideringwhich of them is the right form we took a mean in both cases ofdespotism in the one and of liberty in the other and we saw thatin a mean they attained their perfection but that when they werecarried to the extreme of either slavery or licence neither partywere the gainers 
 meg very true 
 ath and that was our reason for considering the settlement of thedorian army and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of themountains and the removal of cities to the seashore and of ourmention of the first men who were the survivors of the deluge andall that was previously said about music and drinking and whatpreceded was said with the view of seeing how a state might be bestadministered and how an individual might best order his own life andnow megillus and cleinias how can we put to the proof the value ofour words 
 cle stranger i think that i see how a proof of their value maybe obtained this discussion of ours appears to me to have beensingularly fortunate and just what i at this moment want mostauspiciously have you and my friend megillus come in my way for iwill tell you what has happened to me and i regard the coincidence asa sort of omen the greater part of crete is going to send out acolony and they have entrusted the management of the affair to thecnosians and the cnosian government to me and nine others and theydesire us to give them any laws which we please whether taken fromthe cretan model or from any other and they do not mind about theirbeing foreign if they are better grant me then this favour whichwill also be a gain to us make a selection from whathas been said and then let us imagine a state of which we willsuppose ourselves to be the original founders thus we shall proceedwith our enquiry and at the same time i may have the use of theframework which you are constructing for the city which is incontemplation 
 ath good news cleinias if megillus has no objection you maybe sure that i will do all in my power to please you 
 cle thank you 
 meg and so will i 
 cle excellent and now let us begin to frame the state

 book iv 
 
 athenian stranger and now what will this city be i do not mean toask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place that may bedetermined by the accident of locality or of the original or fountain or some local deity may give the sanction of a nameto the city but i do want to know what the situationis whether maritime or inland 
 cleinias i should imagine stranger that the city of which weare speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea 
 ath and are there harbours on the seaboard 
 cle excellent harbours stranger there could not be better 
 ath alas what a prospect and is the surrounding countryproductive or in need of importations 
 cle hardly in need of anything 
 ath and is there any neighbouring state 
 cle none whatever and that is the reason for selecting theplace in days of old there was a migration of the inhabitants andthe region has been deserted from time immemorial 
 ath and has the place a fair proportion of hill and plain andwood 
 cle like the rest of crete in that 
 ath you mean to say that there is more rock than plain 
 cle exactly 
 ath then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous hadyou been on the sea and well provided with harbours and an importingrather than a producing country some mighty saviour would have beenneeded and lawgivers more than mortal if you were ever to have achance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance ofmanners but there is comfort in the eighty stadia although the seais too near especially if as you say the harbours are so we may be content the sea is pleasant enough as a dailycompanion but has indeed also a bitter and brackish the streets with merchants and shopkeepers and begetting inthe souls of men uncertain and unfaithful the stateunfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens and also toother nations there is a consolation therefore in the countryproducing all things at home and yet owing to the ruggedness ofthe soil not providing anything in great abundance had there beenabundance there might have been a great export trade and a greatreturn of gold and silver which as we may safely affirm has themost fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of justand noble sentiments this was said by us if you remember in theprevious discussion 
 cle i remember and am of opinion that we both were and are inthe right 
 ath well but let me ask how is the country supplied with timberfor 
 cle there is no fir of any consequence nor pine and not muchcypress and you will find very little or whichshipwrights always require for the interior of ships 
 ath these are also natural advantages 
 cle why so 
 ath because no city ought to be easily able to imitate itsenemies in what is mischievous 
 cle how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we havebeen speaking 
 ath remember my good friend what i said at first about the cretanlaws that they look to one thing only and this as you bothagreed was war and i replied that such laws in so far as theytended to promote virtue were good but in that they regarded apart only and not the whole of virtue i disapproved of them and nowi hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislatewith a view to anything but virtue or with a view to a part of virtueonly for i consider that the true lawgiver like an archer aims onlyat that on which some eternal beauty is always attending anddismisses everything else whether wealth or any other benefit whenseparated from virtue i was saying that the imitation of enemieswas a bad thing and i was thinking of a case in which a maritimepeople are harassed by enemies as the athenians were by minos i donot speak from any desire to recall past grievances but he as weknow was a great naval potentate who compelled the inhabitants ofattica to pay him a cruel tribute and in those days they had no shipsof war as they now have nor was the country filled and therefore they could not readily build them hencethey could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea and in thisway becoming sailors themselves directly repel their enemies betterfor them to have lost many times over the seven youths than and stationary troops should have been turned intosailors and accustomed to be often leaping on shore and again tocome running back to their ships or should have fancied that therewas no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dyingboldly and that there were good reasons and plenty of them for aman throwing away his arms and betaking himself to isnot dishonourable as people say at certain times this is thelanguage of naval warfare and is anything but worthy of extraordinarypraise for we should not teach bad habits least of all to the bestpart of the citizens you may learn the evil of such a practice fromhomer by whom odysseus is introduced rebuking agamemnon because hedesires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when theachaeans are hard pressed by the gets angry with him andsays 
 who at a time when the battle is in full cry biddest to drag ships into the sea that the prayers of the trojans maybe accomplished yet more and high ruin falls upon us for theachaeans will not maintain the battle when the ships are drawn intothe sea but they will look behind and will cease from strife in thatthe counsel which you give will prove see that he quite knew triremes on the sea in the neighbourhoodof fighting men to be an might be trained in that wayto fly from a herd of deer moreover naval powers which owe theirsafety to ships do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellencewhich is most deserving of it for he who owes his safety to the pilotand the captain and the oarsman and all sorts of rather inferiorpersons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due but howcan a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour 
 cle it is hardly possible i admit and yet stranger we cretansare in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was thesalvation of hellas 
 ath why yes and that is an opinion which is widely spread bothamong hellenes and barbarians but megillus and i say rather that thebattle of marathon was the beginning and the battle of plataea thecompletion of the great deliverance and that these battles by landmade the hellenes better whereas the of salamis i may as well put them both them nobetter if i may say so without offence about the battles which helpedto save us and in estimating the goodness of a state we regardboth the situation of the country and the order of the that the mere preservation and continuance of life isnot the most honourable thing for men as the vulgar think but thecontinuance of the best life while we live and that again if i amjot mistaken is remark which has been made already 
 cle yes 
 ath then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course whichwe acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation ofstates 
 cle the best by far 
 ath and now let me proceed to another question who are to be thecolonists may any one come out of all crete and is the idea that thepopulation in the several states is too numerous for the means ofsubsistence for i suppose that you are not going to send out ageneral invitation to any hellene who likes to come and yet i observethat to your country settlers have come from argos and aegina andother parts of hellas tell me then whence do you draw your recruitsin the present enterprise 
 cle they will come from all crete and of other will be most acceptable for as you truly are cretans of argive descent and the race of cretans which hasthe highest character at the present day is the gortynian and thishas come from gortys in the peloponnesus 
 ath cities find colonization in some respects easier if thecolonists are one race which like a swarm of bees is sent out froma single country either when friends leave friends owing to somepressure of population or other similar necessity or when a portionof a state is driven by factions to emigrate and there have beenwhole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by asuperior power in war this however which is in one way an advantageto the colonist or legislator in another point of view creates adifficulty there is an element of friendship in the community ofrace and language and language and laws and in common templesand rites of worship but colonies which are of this homogeneoussort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitutiondiffering from that which they had at home and although the badnessof their own laws may have been the cause of the factions whichprevailed among them yet from the force of habit they would fainpreserve the very customs which were their ruin and the leader of thecolony who is their legislator finds them troublesome andrebellious on the other hand the conflux of several populationsmight be more disposed to listen to new laws but then to make themcombine and pull together as they say of horses is a mostdifficult task and the work of years and yet there is nothingwhich tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation andcolonization 
 cle no doubt but i should like to know why you say so 
 ath my good friend i am afraid that the course of myspeculations is leading me to say something depreciatory oflegislators but if the word be to the purpose there can be noharm and yet why am i disquieted for i believe that the sameprinciple applies equally to all human things 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i was going to say that man never legislates but accidentsof all sorts which legislate for us in all sorts of ways theviolence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantlyoverturning governments and changing laws and the power of discasehas often caused innovations in the state when there have beenpestilences or when there has been a succession of bad seasonscontinuing during many years any one who sees all this naturallyrushes to the conclusion of which i was speaking that no mortallegislates in anything but that in human affairs chance is almosteverything and this may be said of the arts of the sailor and thepilot and the physician and the general and may seem to be wellsaid and yet there is another thing which may be said with equaltruth of all of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath that god governs all things and that chance and with him in the government of human affairs there a third and less extreme view that art should be there i should say that in a storm there must surely be a greatadvantage in having the aid of the art you would agree 
 cle yes 
 ath and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well asto other things even supposing all the conditions to be favourablewhich are needed for the happiness of the state yet the truelegislator must from time to time appear on the scene 
 cle most true 
 ath in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly forcertain conditions and if these were granted by fortune he wouldthen only require to exercise his art 
 cle certainly 
 ath and all the other artists just now mentioned if they werebidden to offer up each their special prayer would do so 
 cle of course 
 ath and the legislator would do likewise 
 cle i believe that he would 
 ath come legislator we will say to him what are theconditions which you require in a state before you can organize ought he to answer this question shall i give his answer 
 cle yes 
 ath he will me a state which is governed by a tyrant andlet the tyrant be young and have a good memory let him be quick atlearning and of a courageous and noble nature let him have thatquality which as i said before is the inseparable companion of allthe other parts of virtue if there is to be any good in them 
 cle i suppose megillus that this companion virtue of which thestranger speaks must be temperance 
 ath yes cleinias temperance in the vulgar sense not that whichin the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers iscalled prudence but that which is the natural gift of children andanimals of whom some live continently and others incontinently butwhen isolated was as we said hardly worth reckoning in the catalogueof goods i think that you must understand my meaning 
 cle certainly 
 ath then our tyrant must have this as well as the otherqualities if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in theshortest time the form of government which is most conducive tohappiness for there neither is nor ever will be a better orspeedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny 
 cle by what possible arguments stranger can any man persuadehimself of such a monstrous doctrine 
 ath there is surely no difficulty in seeing cleinias what is inaccordance with the order of nature 
 cle you would assume as you say a tyrant who was quick at learning having a good memory courageous of anoble nature 
 ath yes and you must add fortunate and his good fortune must bethat he is the contemporary of a great legislator and that some happychance brings them together when this has been accomplished godhas done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to beeminently prosperous he has done second best for a state in whichthere are two such rulers and third best for a state in which thereare three the difficulty increases with the increase anddiminishes with the diminution of the number 
 cle you mean to say i suppose that the best government isproduced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and anorderly tyrant and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfectform of government takes place most easily less easily when from anoligarchy and in the third degree from a democracy is not thatyour meaning 
 ath not so i mean rather to say that the change is best made outof a tyranny and secondly out of a monarchy and thirdly out ofsome sort of democracy fourth in the capacity for improvement comesoligarchy which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such achange because the government is in the hands of a number ofpotentates i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of thetrue sort and that his strength is united with that of the chiefmen of the state and when the ruling element is numerically at the same time very strong as in a tyranny there the change islikely to be easiest and most rapid 
 cle how i do not understand 
 ath and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times buti suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny 
 cle no and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one 
 ath and yet where there is a tyranny you might certainly see thatof which i am now speaking 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that you might see how without trouble and in no verylong period of time the tyrant if he wishes can change themanners of a state he has only to go in the direction of virtue or ofvice whichever he prefers he himself indicating by his example thelines of conduct praising and rewarding some actions and reprovingothers and degrading those who disobey 
 cle but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will atonce follow the example set to them and how can he have this powerboth of persuading and of compelling them 
 ath let no one my friends persuade us that there is any quickerand easier way in which states change their laws than when therulers lead such changes never have nor ever will come to pass inany other way the real impossibility or difficulty is of anothersort and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages but when once itis surmounted ten thousand or rather all blessings follow 
 cle of what are you speaking 
 ath the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and justinstitutions existing in any powerful forms of government whetherin a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth you might as wellhope to reproduce the character of nestor who is said to haveexcelled all men in the power of speech and yet more in histemperance this however according to the tradition was in thetimes of troy in our own days there is nothing of the sort but ifsuch an one either has or ever shall come into being or is nowamong us blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise wordsthat flow from his lips and this may be said of power in the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom andtemperance then the best laws and the best constitution come intobeing but in no other way and let what i have been saying beregarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle and let this be ourproof that in one point of view there may be a difficulty for a cityto have good laws but that there is another point of view in whichnothing can be easier or sooner effected granting our supposition 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath let us try to amuse ourselves old boys as we are bymoulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state 
 cle let us proceed without delay 
 ath then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state may hehear and be propitious to us and come and set in order the stateand the laws 
 cle may he come 
 ath but what form of polity are we going to give the city 
 cle tell us what you mean a little more clearly do you mean someform of democracy or oligarchy or aristocracy or monarchy for wecannot suppose that you would include tyranny 
 ath which of you will first tell me to which of these classes hisown government is to be referred 
 megillus ought i to answer first since i am the elder 
 cle perhaps you should 
 meg and yet stranger i perceive that i cannot say without morethought what i should call the government of lacedaemon for it seemsto me to be like a power of our ephors is marvellouslytyrannical and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities themost democratical and who can reasonably deny that it is anaristocracy we have also a monarchy which is held for life and issaid by all mankind and not by ourselves only to be the most ancientof all monarchies and therefore when asked on a sudden i cannotprecisely say which form of government the spartan is 
 cle i am in the same difficulty megillus for i do not feelconfident that the polity of cnosus is any of these 
 ath the reason is my excellent friends that you really havepolities but the states of which we were just now speaking are merelyaggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects andservants of a part of their own state and each of them is named afterthe dominant power they are not polities at all but if states are tobe named after their rulers the true state ought to be called bythe name of the god who rules over wise men 
 cle and who is this god 
 ath may i still make use of fable to some extent in the hopethat i may be better able to answer your question shall i 
 cle by all means 
 ath in the primeval world and a long while before the citiescame into being whose settlements we have described there is saidto have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life of whichthe of existing states is a copy 
 cle it will be very necessary to hear about that 
 ath i quite agree with you and therefore i have introduced thesubject 
 cle most appropriately and since the tale is to the point youwill do well in giving us the whole story 
 ath i will do as you suggest there is a tradition of the happylife of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and of this the reason is said to have been as knewwhat we ourselves were declaring that no human nature invested withsupreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow withinsolence and wrong which reflection led him to appoint not men butdemigods who are of a higher and more divine race to be the kingsand rulers of our cities he did as we do with flocks of sheep andother tame animals for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords ofoxen or goats of goats but we ourselves are a superior race andrule over them in like manner god in his love of mankind placedover us the demons who are a superior race and they with greatcase and pleasure to themselves and no less to us taking care us andgiving us peace and reverence and order and justice never the tribes of men happy and united and this tradition whichis true declares that cities of which some mortal man and not godis the ruler have no escape from evils and toils still we must doall that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed inthe days of cronos and as far as the principle of immortality dwellsin us to that we must hearken both in private and public life andregulate our cities and houses according to law meaning by the veryterm law the distribution of mind but if either a single person oran oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures to be filled with them yet retaining none of perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder andthis evil spirit having first trampled the laws under foot becomesthe master either of a state or of an as i wassaying salvation is hopeless and now cleinias we have toconsider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine 
 cle certainly we will 
 ath you are you there are of said to be as manyforms of laws as there are of governments and of the latter we havealready mentioned all those which are commonly recognized now youmust regard this as a matter of importance for what isto be the standard of just and unjust is once more the point atissue men say that the law ought not to regard either militaryvirtue or virtue in general but only the interests and power andpreservation of the established form of government this is thought bythem to be the best way of expressing the natural definition ofjustice 
 cle how 
 ath justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i they say the governing power makes whateverlaws have authority in any state 
 cle true 
 ath well they would add and do you suppose that tyranny ordemocracy or any other conquering power does not make thecontinuance of the power which is possessed by them the first orprincipal object of their laws 
 cle how can they have any other 
 ath and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as by the legislator who calls the laws just 
 cle naturally 
 ath this then is always the mode and fashion in which justiceexists 
 cle certainly if they are correct in their view 
 ath why yes this is one of those false principles of governmentto which we were referring 
 cle which do you mean 
 ath those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought togovern whom did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought togovern their children and the elder the younger and the noble theignoble and there were many other principles if you remember andthey were not always consistent one principle was this very principleof might and we said that pindar considered violence natural andjustified it 
 cle yes i remember 
 ath consider then to whom our state is to be entrusted for thereis a thing which has occurred times without number in states 
 cle what thing 
 ath that when there has been a contest for power those who gainthe upper hand so entirely monopolize the government as to refuse allshare to the defeated party and their live watchingone another the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some onewho has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power andrise up against them now according to our view such governments arenot polities at all nor are laws right which are passed for thegood of particular classes and not for the good of the whole which have such laws are not polities but parties and theirnotions of justice are simply unmeaning i say this because i amgoing to assert that we must not entrust the government in yourstate to any one because he is rich or because he possesses any otheradvantage such as strength or stature or again birth but he who ismost obedient to the laws of the state he shall win the palm andto him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given thehighest office and chief ministry of the gods and the second to himwho bears the second palm and on a similar principle shall all theother be assigned to those who come next in order and when i call therulers servants or ministers of the law i give them this name not forthe sake of novelty but because i certainly believe that upon suchservice or ministry depends the well or of the state forthat state in which the law is subject and has no authority iperceive to be on the highway to ruin but i see that the state inwhich the law is above the rulers and the rulers are the inferiors ofthe law has salvation and every blessing which the gods can confer 
 cle truly stranger you see with the keen vision of age 
 ath why yes every man when he is young has that sort of visiondullest and when he is old keenest 
 cle very true 
 ath and now what is to be the next step may we not suppose thecolonists to have arrived and proceed to make our speech to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath friends we say to as the old tradition in his hand the beginning middle and end of all that according to his nature in a straight line towards theaccomplishment of his end justice always accompanies him and isthe punisher of those who fall short of the divine law to justice hewho would be happy holds fast and follows in her company with allhumility and order but he who is lifted up with pride or elated bywealth or rank or beauty who is young and foolish and has a soulhot with insolence and thinks that he has no need of any guide orruler but is able himself to be the guide of others he i say isleft deserted of god and being thus deserted he takes to himothers who are like himself and dances about throwing all thingsinto confusion and many think that he is a great man but in ashort time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve andis utterly destroyed and his family and city with him that human things are thus ordered what should a wise man door think or not do or think 
 cle every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one ofthe followers of god there can be no doubt of that 
 ath then what life is agreeable to god and becoming in hisfollowers one only expressed once for all in the old saying agrees with like with measure measure but things which haveno measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things whichhave now god ought to be to us the measure of all things and notman as men commonly say protagoras the words are far more trueof him and he who would be dear to god must as far as is like him and such as he is wherefore the temperate man is thefriend of god for he is like him and the intemperate man is unlikehim and different from him and unjust and the same applies to otherthings and this is the conclusion which is also the noblest andtruest of all for the good man to offer sacrifice tothe gods and hold converse with them by means of prayers andofferings and every kind of service is the noblest and best of allthings and also the most conducive to a happy life and very fitand meet but with the bad man the opposite of this is true forthe bad man has an impure soul whereas the good is pure and from onewho is polluted neither good man nor god can without improprietyreceive gifts wherefore the unholy do only waste their much serviceupon the gods but when offered by any holy man such service ismost acceptable to them this is the mark at which we ought to what weapons shall we use and how shall we direct them in thefirst place we affirm that next after the olympian gods and thegods of the state honour should be given to the gods below theyshould receive everything in even and of the second choice and illomen while the odd numbers and the first choice and the things oflucky omen are given to the gods above by him who would rightlyhit the mark of piety next to these gods a wise man will doservice to the demons or spirits and then to the heroes and afterthem will follow the private and ancestral gods who are worshipped asthe law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them nextcomes the honour of living parents to whom as is meet we have topay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts considering thatall which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and broughthim up and that he must do all that he can to minister to in his property secondly in his person and thirdly in hissoul in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowedupon him of old in the days of his infancy and which he is now topay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their all his life long he ought never to utter or to have unbecoming word to them for of light and fleeting words thepenalty is most severe nemesis the messenger of justice isappointed to watch over all such matters when they are angry and wantto satisfy their feelings in word or deed he should give way to a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may bereasonably expected to be very angry at their death the mostmoderate funeral is best neither exceeding the customary expense noryet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by theformer generation to their parents and let a man not forget to paythe yearly tribute of respect to the dead honouring them chiefly byomitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them andgiving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead doing living after this manner we shall receive our reward from thegods and those who are above us the demons and we shall spendour days for the most part in good hope and how a man ought toorder what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friendsand and the rites of hospitality taught by the intercourse which arises out of all these duties with aview to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own i say the laws as we proceed with them will persuading and partly when natures do not yield to thepersuasion of custom chastising them by might and right and willthus render our state if the gods with us prosperousand happy but of what has to be said and must be said by thelegislator who is of my way of thinking and yet if said in theform of law would be out of this i think that he may givea sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he islegislating and then when as far as he is able he has gonethrough all the preliminaries he may proceed to the work oflegislation now what will be the form of such prefaces there may bea difficulty in including or describing them all under a singleform but i think that we may get some notion of them if we canguarantee one thing 
 cle what is that 
 ath i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtueas possible this will surely be the aim of the legislator in allhis laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath the proposal appears to me to be of some value and i thinkthat a person will listen with more gentleness and to theprecepts addressed to him by the legislator when his soul is notaltogether unprepared to receive them even a little done in the wayof conciliation gains his ear and is always worth having for thereis no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be madeas good or as quickly good as possible the case of the manyproves the wisdom of hesiod who says that the road to wickedness issmooth and can be travelled without perspiring because it is sovery short 
 but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of long and steep is the way thither and rugged at first but whenyou have reached the top although difficult before it is then easy 
 cle yes and he certainly speaks well 
 ath very true and now let me tell you the effect which thepreceding discourse has had upon me 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we have a little conversation with the say to legislator speak if you know what we ought to sayand do you can surely tell 
 cle of course he can 
 ath did we not hear you just now saying that the legislator oughtnot to allow the poets to do what they liked for that they wouldnot know in which of their words they went against the laws to thehurt of the state 
 cle that is true 
 ath may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets 
 cle what answer shall we make to him 
 ath that the poet according to the tradition which has everprevailed among us and is accepted of all men when he sits down onthe tripod of the muse is not in his right mind like a allows to flow out freely whatever comes in and his art beingimitative he is often compelled to represent men of oppositedispositions and thus to contradict himself neither can he tellwhether there is more truth in one thing that he has said than inanother this is not the case in a law the legislator must give nottwo rules about the same thing but one only take an example fromwhat you have just been saying of three kinds of funerals there isone which is too extravagant another is too niggardly the third is amean and you choose and approve and order the last withoutqualification but if i had an extremely rich wife and she bade mebury her and describe her burial in a poem i should praise theextravagant sort and a poor miserly man who had not much money tospend would approve of the niggardly and the man of moderatemeans who was himself moderate would praise a moderate you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say amoderate funeral but you must define what moderation is and howmuch unless you are definite you must not suppose that you arespeaking a language that can become law 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws but tosay at once do this avoid then holding the penalty interrorem to go on to another law offering never a word of advice orexhortation to those for whom he is legislating after the manner ofsome doctors for of doctors as i may remind you some have agentler others a ruder method of cure and as children ask the doctorto be gentle with them so we will ask the legislator to cure ourdisorders with the gentlest remedies what i mean to say is thatbesides doctors there are doctors servants who are also styleddoctors 
 cle very true 
 ath and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observingtheir masters empirically and not according to the natural way oflearning as the manner of freemen is who have learned scientificallythemselves the art which they impart scientifically to their are aware that there are these two classes of doctors 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and did you ever observe that there are two classes of patientsin states slaves and freemen and the slave doctors run about andcure the slaves or wait for them in the ofthis sort never talk to their patients individually or let themtalk about their own individual complaints the slave doctorprescribes what mere experience suggests as if he had exactknowledge and when he has given his orders like a tyrant herushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is so he relieves the master of the house of the care of hisinvalid slaves but the other doctor who is a freeman attends andpractises upon freemen and he carries his enquiries far back andgoes into the nature of the disorder he enters into discourse withthe patient and with his friends and is at once getting informationfrom the sick man and also instructing him as far as he is he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him atlast when he has brought the patient more and more under hispersuasive influences and set him on the road to health he attemptsto effect a cure now which is the better way of proceeding in aphysician and in a trainer is he the better who accomplishes his endsin a double way or he who works in one way and that the ruder andinferior 
 cle i should say stranger that the double way is far better 
 ath should you like to see an example of the double and singlemethod in legislation 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath what will be our first law will not the the order of by making regulations for states about births 
 cle he will 
 ath in all states the birth of children goes back to the connectionof marriage 
 cle very true 
 ath and according to the true order the laws relating to marriageshould be those which are first determined in every state 
 cle quite so 
 ath then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form itmay run as man shall marry between the ages of thirty or if he does not he shall pay such and such a fine orshall suffer the loss of such and such privileges this would be thesimple law about marriage the double law would run manshall marry between the ages of thirty and consideringthat in a manner the human race naturally partakes of every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost for thedesire of every man that he may become famous and not lie in thegrave without a name is only the love of continuance now mankind arecoeval with all time and are ever following and will ever course of time and so they are immortal because they children behind them and partake of immortality in theunity of generation and for a man voluntarily to deprive himself ofthis gift as he deliberately does who will not have a wife orchildren is impiety he who obeys the law shall be free and shallpay no fine but he who is disobedient and does not marry when hehas arrived at the age of shall pay a yearly fine of acertain amount in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bringease and profit to him and he shall not share in the honours whichthe young men in the state give to the aged comparing now the twoforms of the law you will be able to arrive at a judgment about anyother they should be double in length even when they have to persuade as well as threaten or whether theyshall only threaten and be of half the length 
 meg the shorter form stranger would be more in accordance withlacedaemonian custom although for my own part if any one were toask me which i myself prefer in the state i should certainlydetermine in favour of the longer and i would have every law madeafter the same pattern if i had to choose but i think thatcleinias is the person to be consulted for his is the state whichis going to use these laws 
 cle thank you megillus 
 ath whether in the abstract words are to be many or few is avery foolish question the best form and not the shortest is to beapproved nor is length at all to be regarded of the two forms of lawwhich have been recited the one is not only twice as good inpractical usefulness as the other but the case is like that of thetwo kinds of doctors which i was just now mentioning and yetlegislators never appear to have considered that they have twoinstruments which they might use in andforce for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude they usethe one only as far as they can they do not mingle persuasion withcoercion but employ force pure and simple moreover there is a thirdpoint sweet friends which ought to be and never is regarded in ourexisting laws 
 cle what is it 
 ath a point arising out of our previous discussion which comesinto my mind in some mysterious way all this time from early dawnuntil noon have we been talking about laws in this charmingretreat now we are going to promulgate our laws and what haspreceded was only the prelude of them why do i mention this for all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes andovertures which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to helpthe strain which is to be performed lyric measures and music of everyother kind have preludes framed with wonderful care but of thetruer and higher strain of law and politics no one has ever yetuttered any prelude or composed or published any as though there wasno such thing in nature whereas our present discussion seems to me toimply that there double laws of which we were speaking arenot exactly double but they are in two parts the law and the preludeof the law the arbitrary command which was compared to thecommands of doctors whom we described as of the meaner sort wasthe law pure and simple and that which preceded and was described byour friend here as being hortatory only was although in fact anexhortation likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse fori imagine that all this language of conciliation which the legislatorhas been uttering in the preface of the law was intended to creategoodwill in the person whom he addressed in order that by reasonof this he might more intelligently receive his is to say the law and therefore in my way of speaking this ismore rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of thelaw and i must further proceed to observe that to all his to each separately the legislator should prefix a preamble heshould remember how great will be the difference between as they have or have not such preambles as in the casealready given 
 cle the lawgiver if he asks my opinion will certainly legislatein the form which you advise 
 ath i think that you are right cleinias in affirming that alllaws have preambles and that throughout the whole of this work oflegislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at thebeginning for that which is to follow is most important and it makesall the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or we should be wrong in requiring that all laws small and greatalike should have preambles of the same kind any more than all songsor speeches although they may be natural to all they are notalways necessary and whether they are to be employed or not has ineach case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the in the present instance of the lawgiver 
 cle that i think is most true and now stranger without delay letus return to the argument and as people say in play make a secondand better beginning if you please with the principles which we havebeen laying down which we never thought of regarding as a preamblebefore but of which we may now make a preamble and not merelyconsider them to be chance topics of discourse let us that we have a preamble about the honour of the gods and therespect of parents enough has been already said and we may proceedto the topics which follow next in order until the preamble is deemedby you to be complete and after that you shall go through the lawsthemselves 
 ath i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficientpreamble about gods and and about parents living or now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the lightof day 
 cle exactly 
 ath after this as is meet and for the interest of us all i thespeaker and you the listeners will try to estimate all thatrelates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens asregards both their occupations and arrive as far as in us lies atthe nature of education these then are the topics which follow nextin order 
 cle very good

 book iv 
 
 athenian stranger and now what will this city be i do not mean toask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place that may bedetermined by the accident of locality or of the original or fountain or some local deity may give the sanction of a nameto the city but i do want to know what the situationis whether maritime or inland 
 cleinias i should imagine stranger that the city of which weare speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea 
 ath and are there harbours on the seaboard 
 cle excellent harbours stranger there could not be better 
 ath alas what a prospect and is the surrounding countryproductive or in need of importations 
 cle hardly in need of anything 
 ath and is there any neighbouring state 
 cle none whatever and that is the reason for selecting theplace in days of old there was a migration of the inhabitants andthe region has been deserted from time immemorial 
 ath and has the place a fair proportion of hill and plain andwood 
 cle like the rest of crete in that 
 ath you mean to say that there is more rock than plain 
 cle exactly 
 ath then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous hadyou been on the sea and well provided with harbours and an importingrather than a producing country some mighty saviour would have beenneeded and lawgivers more than mortal if you were ever to have achance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance ofmanners but there is comfort in the eighty stadia although the seais too near especially if as you say the harbours are so we may be content the sea is pleasant enough as a dailycompanion but has indeed also a bitter and brackish the streets with merchants and shopkeepers and begetting inthe souls of men uncertain and unfaithful the stateunfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens and also toother nations there is a consolation therefore in the countryproducing all things at home and yet owing to the ruggedness ofthe soil not providing anything in great abundance had there beenabundance there might have been a great export trade and a greatreturn of gold and silver which as we may safely affirm has themost fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of justand noble sentiments this was said by us if you remember in theprevious discussion 
 cle i remember and am of opinion that we both were and are inthe right 
 ath well but let me ask how is the country supplied with timberfor 
 cle there is no fir of any consequence nor pine and not muchcypress and you will find very little or whichshipwrights always require for the interior of ships 
 ath these are also natural advantages 
 cle why so 
 ath because no city ought to be easily able to imitate itsenemies in what is mischievous 
 cle how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we havebeen speaking 
 ath remember my good friend what i said at first about the cretanlaws that they look to one thing only and this as you bothagreed was war and i replied that such laws in so far as theytended to promote virtue were good but in that they regarded apart only and not the whole of virtue i disapproved of them and nowi hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislatewith a view to anything but virtue or with a view to a part of virtueonly for i consider that the true lawgiver like an archer aims onlyat that on which some eternal beauty is always attending anddismisses everything else whether wealth or any other benefit whenseparated from virtue i was saying that the imitation of enemieswas a bad thing and i was thinking of a case in which a maritimepeople are harassed by enemies as the athenians were by minos i donot speak from any desire to recall past grievances but he as weknow was a great naval potentate who compelled the inhabitants ofattica to pay him a cruel tribute and in those days they had no shipsof war as they now have nor was the country filled and therefore they could not readily build them hencethey could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea and in thisway becoming sailors themselves directly repel their enemies betterfor them to have lost many times over the seven youths than and stationary troops should have been turned intosailors and accustomed to be often leaping on shore and again tocome running back to their ships or should have fancied that therewas no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dyingboldly and that there were good reasons and plenty of them for aman throwing away his arms and betaking himself to isnot dishonourable as people say at certain times this is thelanguage of naval warfare and is anything but worthy of extraordinarypraise for we should not teach bad habits least of all to the bestpart of the citizens you may learn the evil of such a practice fromhomer by whom odysseus is introduced rebuking agamemnon because hedesires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when theachaeans are hard pressed by the gets angry with him andsays 
 who at a time when the battle is in full cry biddest to drag ships into the sea that the prayers of the trojans maybe accomplished yet more and high ruin falls upon us for theachaeans will not maintain the battle when the ships are drawn intothe sea but they will look behind and will cease from strife in thatthe counsel which you give will prove see that he quite knew triremes on the sea in the neighbourhoodof fighting men to be an might be trained in that wayto fly from a herd of deer moreover naval powers which owe theirsafety to ships do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellencewhich is most deserving of it for he who owes his safety to the pilotand the captain and the oarsman and all sorts of rather inferiorpersons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due but howcan a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour 
 cle it is hardly possible i admit and yet stranger we cretansare in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was thesalvation of hellas 
 ath why yes and that is an opinion which is widely spread bothamong hellenes and barbarians but megillus and i say rather that thebattle of marathon was the beginning and the battle of plataea thecompletion of the great deliverance and that these battles by landmade the hellenes better whereas the of salamis i may as well put them both them nobetter if i may say so without offence about the battles which helpedto save us and in estimating the goodness of a state we regardboth the situation of the country and the order of the that the mere preservation and continuance of life isnot the most honourable thing for men as the vulgar think but thecontinuance of the best life while we live and that again if i amjot mistaken is remark which has been made already 
 cle yes 
 ath then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course whichwe acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation ofstates 
 cle the best by far 
 ath and now let me proceed to another question who are to be thecolonists may any one come out of all crete and is the idea that thepopulation in the several states is too numerous for the means ofsubsistence for i suppose that you are not going to send out ageneral invitation to any hellene who likes to come and yet i observethat to your country settlers have come from argos and aegina andother parts of hellas tell me then whence do you draw your recruitsin the present enterprise 
 cle they will come from all crete and of other will be most acceptable for as you truly are cretans of argive descent and the race of cretans which hasthe highest character at the present day is the gortynian and thishas come from gortys in the peloponnesus 
 ath cities find colonization in some respects easier if thecolonists are one race which like a swarm of bees is sent out froma single country either when friends leave friends owing to somepressure of population or other similar necessity or when a portionof a state is driven by factions to emigrate and there have beenwhole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by asuperior power in war this however which is in one way an advantageto the colonist or legislator in another point of view creates adifficulty there is an element of friendship in the community ofrace and language and language and laws and in common templesand rites of worship but colonies which are of this homogeneoussort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitutiondiffering from that which they had at home and although the badnessof their own laws may have been the cause of the factions whichprevailed among them yet from the force of habit they would fainpreserve the very customs which were their ruin and the leader of thecolony who is their legislator finds them troublesome andrebellious on the other hand the conflux of several populationsmight be more disposed to listen to new laws but then to make themcombine and pull together as they say of horses is a mostdifficult task and the work of years and yet there is nothingwhich tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation andcolonization 
 cle no doubt but i should like to know why you say so 
 ath my good friend i am afraid that the course of myspeculations is leading me to say something depreciatory oflegislators but if the word be to the purpose there can be noharm and yet why am i disquieted for i believe that the sameprinciple applies equally to all human things 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i was going to say that man never legislates but accidentsof all sorts which legislate for us in all sorts of ways theviolence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantlyoverturning governments and changing laws and the power of discasehas often caused innovations in the state when there have beenpestilences or when there has been a succession of bad seasonscontinuing during many years any one who sees all this naturallyrushes to the conclusion of which i was speaking that no mortallegislates in anything but that in human affairs chance is almosteverything and this may be said of the arts of the sailor and thepilot and the physician and the general and may seem to be wellsaid and yet there is another thing which may be said with equaltruth of all of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath that god governs all things and that chance and with him in the government of human affairs there a third and less extreme view that art should be there i should say that in a storm there must surely be a greatadvantage in having the aid of the art you would agree 
 cle yes 
 ath and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well asto other things even supposing all the conditions to be favourablewhich are needed for the happiness of the state yet the truelegislator must from time to time appear on the scene 
 cle most true 
 ath in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly forcertain conditions and if these were granted by fortune he wouldthen only require to exercise his art 
 cle certainly 
 ath and all the other artists just now mentioned if they werebidden to offer up each their special prayer would do so 
 cle of course 
 ath and the legislator would do likewise 
 cle i believe that he would 
 ath come legislator we will say to him what are theconditions which you require in a state before you can organize ought he to answer this question shall i give his answer 
 cle yes 
 ath he will me a state which is governed by a tyrant andlet the tyrant be young and have a good memory let him be quick atlearning and of a courageous and noble nature let him have thatquality which as i said before is the inseparable companion of allthe other parts of virtue if there is to be any good in them 
 cle i suppose megillus that this companion virtue of which thestranger speaks must be temperance 
 ath yes cleinias temperance in the vulgar sense not that whichin the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers iscalled prudence but that which is the natural gift of children andanimals of whom some live continently and others incontinently butwhen isolated was as we said hardly worth reckoning in the catalogueof goods i think that you must understand my meaning 
 cle certainly 
 ath then our tyrant must have this as well as the otherqualities if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in theshortest time the form of government which is most conducive tohappiness for there neither is nor ever will be a better orspeedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny 
 cle by what possible arguments stranger can any man persuadehimself of such a monstrous doctrine 
 ath there is surely no difficulty in seeing cleinias what is inaccordance with the order of nature 
 cle you would assume as you say a tyrant who was quick at learning having a good memory courageous of anoble nature 
 ath yes and you must add fortunate and his good fortune must bethat he is the contemporary of a great legislator and that some happychance brings them together when this has been accomplished godhas done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to beeminently prosperous he has done second best for a state in whichthere are two such rulers and third best for a state in which thereare three the difficulty increases with the increase anddiminishes with the diminution of the number 
 cle you mean to say i suppose that the best government isproduced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and anorderly tyrant and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfectform of government takes place most easily less easily when from anoligarchy and in the third degree from a democracy is not thatyour meaning 
 ath not so i mean rather to say that the change is best made outof a tyranny and secondly out of a monarchy and thirdly out ofsome sort of democracy fourth in the capacity for improvement comesoligarchy which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such achange because the government is in the hands of a number ofpotentates i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of thetrue sort and that his strength is united with that of the chiefmen of the state and when the ruling element is numerically at the same time very strong as in a tyranny there the change islikely to be easiest and most rapid 
 cle how i do not understand 
 ath and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times buti suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny 
 cle no and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one 
 ath and yet where there is a tyranny you might certainly see thatof which i am now speaking 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that you might see how without trouble and in no verylong period of time the tyrant if he wishes can change themanners of a state he has only to go in the direction of virtue or ofvice whichever he prefers he himself indicating by his example thelines of conduct praising and rewarding some actions and reprovingothers and degrading those who disobey 
 cle but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will atonce follow the example set to them and how can he have this powerboth of persuading and of compelling them 
 ath let no one my friends persuade us that there is any quickerand easier way in which states change their laws than when therulers lead such changes never have nor ever will come to pass inany other way the real impossibility or difficulty is of anothersort and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages but when once itis surmounted ten thousand or rather all blessings follow 
 cle of what are you speaking 
 ath the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and justinstitutions existing in any powerful forms of government whetherin a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth you might as wellhope to reproduce the character of nestor who is said to haveexcelled all men in the power of speech and yet more in histemperance this however according to the tradition was in thetimes of troy in our own days there is nothing of the sort but ifsuch an one either has or ever shall come into being or is nowamong us blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise wordsthat flow from his lips and this may be said of power in the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom andtemperance then the best laws and the best constitution come intobeing but in no other way and let what i have been saying beregarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle and let this be ourproof that in one point of view there may be a difficulty for a cityto have good laws but that there is another point of view in whichnothing can be easier or sooner effected granting our supposition 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath let us try to amuse ourselves old boys as we are bymoulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state 
 cle let us proceed without delay 
 ath then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state may hehear and be propitious to us and come and set in order the stateand the laws 
 cle may he come 
 ath but what form of polity are we going to give the city 
 cle tell us what you mean a little more clearly do you mean someform of democracy or oligarchy or aristocracy or monarchy for wecannot suppose that you would include tyranny 
 ath which of you will first tell me to which of these classes hisown government is to be referred 
 megillus ought i to answer first since i am the elder 
 cle perhaps you should 
 meg and yet stranger i perceive that i cannot say without morethought what i should call the government of lacedaemon for it seemsto me to be like a power of our ephors is marvellouslytyrannical and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities themost democratical and who can reasonably deny that it is anaristocracy we have also a monarchy which is held for life and issaid by all mankind and not by ourselves only to be the most ancientof all monarchies and therefore when asked on a sudden i cannotprecisely say which form of government the spartan is 
 cle i am in the same difficulty megillus for i do not feelconfident that the polity of cnosus is any of these 
 ath the reason is my excellent friends that you really havepolities but the states of which we were just now speaking are merelyaggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects andservants of a part of their own state and each of them is named afterthe dominant power they are not polities at all but if states are tobe named after their rulers the true state ought to be called bythe name of the god who rules over wise men 
 cle and who is this god 
 ath may i still make use of fable to some extent in the hopethat i may be better able to answer your question shall i 
 cle by all means 
 ath in the primeval world and a long while before the citiescame into being whose settlements we have described there is saidto have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life of whichthe of existing states is a copy 
 cle it will be very necessary to hear about that 
 ath i quite agree with you and therefore i have introduced thesubject 
 cle most appropriately and since the tale is to the point youwill do well in giving us the whole story 
 ath i will do as you suggest there is a tradition of the happylife of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and of this the reason is said to have been as knewwhat we ourselves were declaring that no human nature invested withsupreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow withinsolence and wrong which reflection led him to appoint not men butdemigods who are of a higher and more divine race to be the kingsand rulers of our cities he did as we do with flocks of sheep andother tame animals for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords ofoxen or goats of goats but we ourselves are a superior race andrule over them in like manner god in his love of mankind placedover us the demons who are a superior race and they with greatcase and pleasure to themselves and no less to us taking care us andgiving us peace and reverence and order and justice never the tribes of men happy and united and this tradition whichis true declares that cities of which some mortal man and not godis the ruler have no escape from evils and toils still we must doall that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed inthe days of cronos and as far as the principle of immortality dwellsin us to that we must hearken both in private and public life andregulate our cities and houses according to law meaning by the veryterm law the distribution of mind but if either a single person oran oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures to be filled with them yet retaining none of perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder andthis evil spirit having first trampled the laws under foot becomesthe master either of a state or of an as i wassaying salvation is hopeless and now cleinias we have toconsider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine 
 cle certainly we will 
 ath you are you there are of said to be as manyforms of laws as there are of governments and of the latter we havealready mentioned all those which are commonly recognized now youmust regard this as a matter of importance for what isto be the standard of just and unjust is once more the point atissue men say that the law ought not to regard either militaryvirtue or virtue in general but only the interests and power andpreservation of the established form of government this is thought bythem to be the best way of expressing the natural definition ofjustice 
 cle how 
 ath justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i they say the governing power makes whateverlaws have authority in any state 
 cle true 
 ath well they would add and do you suppose that tyranny ordemocracy or any other conquering power does not make thecontinuance of the power which is possessed by them the first orprincipal object of their laws 
 cle how can they have any other 
 ath and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as by the legislator who calls the laws just 
 cle naturally 
 ath this then is always the mode and fashion in which justiceexists 
 cle certainly if they are correct in their view 
 ath why yes this is one of those false principles of governmentto which we were referring 
 cle which do you mean 
 ath those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought togovern whom did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought togovern their children and the elder the younger and the noble theignoble and there were many other principles if you remember andthey were not always consistent one principle was this very principleof might and we said that pindar considered violence natural andjustified it 
 cle yes i remember 
 ath consider then to whom our state is to be entrusted for thereis a thing which has occurred times without number in states 
 cle what thing 
 ath that when there has been a contest for power those who gainthe upper hand so entirely monopolize the government as to refuse allshare to the defeated party and their live watchingone another the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some onewho has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power andrise up against them now according to our view such governments arenot polities at all nor are laws right which are passed for thegood of particular classes and not for the good of the whole which have such laws are not polities but parties and theirnotions of justice are simply unmeaning i say this because i amgoing to assert that we must not entrust the government in yourstate to any one because he is rich or because he possesses any otheradvantage such as strength or stature or again birth but he who ismost obedient to the laws of the state he shall win the palm andto him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given thehighest office and chief ministry of the gods and the second to himwho bears the second palm and on a similar principle shall all theother be assigned to those who come next in order and when i call therulers servants or ministers of the law i give them this name not forthe sake of novelty but because i certainly believe that upon suchservice or ministry depends the well or of the state forthat state in which the law is subject and has no authority iperceive to be on the highway to ruin but i see that the state inwhich the law is above the rulers and the rulers are the inferiors ofthe law has salvation and every blessing which the gods can confer 
 cle truly stranger you see with the keen vision of age 
 ath why yes every man when he is young has that sort of visiondullest and when he is old keenest 
 cle very true 
 ath and now what is to be the next step may we not suppose thecolonists to have arrived and proceed to make our speech to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath friends we say to as the old tradition in his hand the beginning middle and end of all that according to his nature in a straight line towards theaccomplishment of his end justice always accompanies him and isthe punisher of those who fall short of the divine law to justice hewho would be happy holds fast and follows in her company with allhumility and order but he who is lifted up with pride or elated bywealth or rank or beauty who is young and foolish and has a soulhot with insolence and thinks that he has no need of any guide orruler but is able himself to be the guide of others he i say isleft deserted of god and being thus deserted he takes to himothers who are like himself and dances about throwing all thingsinto confusion and many think that he is a great man but in ashort time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve andis utterly destroyed and his family and city with him that human things are thus ordered what should a wise man door think or not do or think 
 cle every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one ofthe followers of god there can be no doubt of that 
 ath then what life is agreeable to god and becoming in hisfollowers one only expressed once for all in the old saying agrees with like with measure measure but things which haveno measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things whichhave now god ought to be to us the measure of all things and notman as men commonly say protagoras the words are far more trueof him and he who would be dear to god must as far as is like him and such as he is wherefore the temperate man is thefriend of god for he is like him and the intemperate man is unlikehim and different from him and unjust and the same applies to otherthings and this is the conclusion which is also the noblest andtruest of all for the good man to offer sacrifice tothe gods and hold converse with them by means of prayers andofferings and every kind of service is the noblest and best of allthings and also the most conducive to a happy life and very fitand meet but with the bad man the opposite of this is true forthe bad man has an impure soul whereas the good is pure and from onewho is polluted neither good man nor god can without improprietyreceive gifts wherefore the unholy do only waste their much serviceupon the gods but when offered by any holy man such service ismost acceptable to them this is the mark at which we ought to what weapons shall we use and how shall we direct them in thefirst place we affirm that next after the olympian gods and thegods of the state honour should be given to the gods below theyshould receive everything in even and of the second choice and illomen while the odd numbers and the first choice and the things oflucky omen are given to the gods above by him who would rightlyhit the mark of piety next to these gods a wise man will doservice to the demons or spirits and then to the heroes and afterthem will follow the private and ancestral gods who are worshipped asthe law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them nextcomes the honour of living parents to whom as is meet we have topay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts considering thatall which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and broughthim up and that he must do all that he can to minister to in his property secondly in his person and thirdly in hissoul in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowedupon him of old in the days of his infancy and which he is now topay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their all his life long he ought never to utter or to have unbecoming word to them for of light and fleeting words thepenalty is most severe nemesis the messenger of justice isappointed to watch over all such matters when they are angry and wantto satisfy their feelings in word or deed he should give way to a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may bereasonably expected to be very angry at their death the mostmoderate funeral is best neither exceeding the customary expense noryet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by theformer generation to their parents and let a man not forget to paythe yearly tribute of respect to the dead honouring them chiefly byomitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them andgiving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead doing living after this manner we shall receive our reward from thegods and those who are above us the demons and we shall spendour days for the most part in good hope and how a man ought toorder what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friendsand and the rites of hospitality taught by the intercourse which arises out of all these duties with aview to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own i say the laws as we proceed with them will persuading and partly when natures do not yield to thepersuasion of custom chastising them by might and right and willthus render our state if the gods with us prosperousand happy but of what has to be said and must be said by thelegislator who is of my way of thinking and yet if said in theform of law would be out of this i think that he may givea sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he islegislating and then when as far as he is able he has gonethrough all the preliminaries he may proceed to the work oflegislation now what will be the form of such prefaces there may bea difficulty in including or describing them all under a singleform but i think that we may get some notion of them if we canguarantee one thing 
 cle what is that 
 ath i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtueas possible this will surely be the aim of the legislator in allhis laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath the proposal appears to me to be of some value and i thinkthat a person will listen with more gentleness and to theprecepts addressed to him by the legislator when his soul is notaltogether unprepared to receive them even a little done in the wayof conciliation gains his ear and is always worth having for thereis no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be madeas good or as quickly good as possible the case of the manyproves the wisdom of hesiod who says that the road to wickedness issmooth and can be travelled without perspiring because it is sovery short 
 but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of long and steep is the way thither and rugged at first but whenyou have reached the top although difficult before it is then easy 
 cle yes and he certainly speaks well 
 ath very true and now let me tell you the effect which thepreceding discourse has had upon me 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we have a little conversation with the say to legislator speak if you know what we ought to sayand do you can surely tell 
 cle of course he can 
 ath did we not hear you just now saying that the legislator oughtnot to allow the poets to do what they liked for that they wouldnot know in which of their words they went against the laws to thehurt of the state 
 cle that is true 
 ath may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets 
 cle what answer shall we make to him 
 ath that the poet according to the tradition which has everprevailed among us and is accepted of all men when he sits down onthe tripod of the muse is not in his right mind like a allows to flow out freely whatever comes in and his art beingimitative he is often compelled to represent men of oppositedispositions and thus to contradict himself neither can he tellwhether there is more truth in one thing that he has said than inanother this is not the case in a law the legislator must give nottwo rules about the same thing but one only take an example fromwhat you have just been saying of three kinds of funerals there isone which is too extravagant another is too niggardly the third is amean and you choose and approve and order the last withoutqualification but if i had an extremely rich wife and she bade mebury her and describe her burial in a poem i should praise theextravagant sort and a poor miserly man who had not much money tospend would approve of the niggardly and the man of moderatemeans who was himself moderate would praise a moderate you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say amoderate funeral but you must define what moderation is and howmuch unless you are definite you must not suppose that you arespeaking a language that can become law 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws but tosay at once do this avoid then holding the penalty interrorem to go on to another law offering never a word of advice orexhortation to those for whom he is legislating after the manner ofsome doctors for of doctors as i may remind you some have agentler others a ruder method of cure and as children ask the doctorto be gentle with them so we will ask the legislator to cure ourdisorders with the gentlest remedies what i mean to say is thatbesides doctors there are doctors servants who are also styleddoctors 
 cle very true 
 ath and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observingtheir masters empirically and not according to the natural way oflearning as the manner of freemen is who have learned scientificallythemselves the art which they impart scientifically to their are aware that there are these two classes of doctors 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and did you ever observe that there are two classes of patientsin states slaves and freemen and the slave doctors run about andcure the slaves or wait for them in the ofthis sort never talk to their patients individually or let themtalk about their own individual complaints the slave doctorprescribes what mere experience suggests as if he had exactknowledge and when he has given his orders like a tyrant herushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is so he relieves the master of the house of the care of hisinvalid slaves but the other doctor who is a freeman attends andpractises upon freemen and he carries his enquiries far back andgoes into the nature of the disorder he enters into discourse withthe patient and with his friends and is at once getting informationfrom the sick man and also instructing him as far as he is he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him atlast when he has brought the patient more and more under hispersuasive influences and set him on the road to health he attemptsto effect a cure now which is the better way of proceeding in aphysician and in a trainer is he the better who accomplishes his endsin a double way or he who works in one way and that the ruder andinferior 
 cle i should say stranger that the double way is far better 
 ath should you like to see an example of the double and singlemethod in legislation 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath what will be our first law will not the the order of by making regulations for states about births 
 cle he will 
 ath in all states the birth of children goes back to the connectionof marriage 
 cle very true 
 ath and according to the true order the laws relating to marriageshould be those which are first determined in every state 
 cle quite so 
 ath then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form itmay run as man shall marry between the ages of thirty or if he does not he shall pay such and such a fine orshall suffer the loss of such and such privileges this would be thesimple law about marriage the double law would run manshall marry between the ages of thirty and consideringthat in a manner the human race naturally partakes of every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost for thedesire of every man that he may become famous and not lie in thegrave without a name is only the love of continuance now mankind arecoeval with all time and are ever following and will ever course of time and so they are immortal because they children behind them and partake of immortality in theunity of generation and for a man voluntarily to deprive himself ofthis gift as he deliberately does who will not have a wife orchildren is impiety he who obeys the law shall be free and shallpay no fine but he who is disobedient and does not marry when hehas arrived at the age of shall pay a yearly fine of acertain amount in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bringease and profit to him and he shall not share in the honours whichthe young men in the state give to the aged comparing now the twoforms of the law you will be able to arrive at a judgment about anyother they should be double in length even when they have to persuade as well as threaten or whether theyshall only threaten and be of half the length 
 meg the shorter form stranger would be more in accordance withlacedaemonian custom although for my own part if any one were toask me which i myself prefer in the state i should certainlydetermine in favour of the longer and i would have every law madeafter the same pattern if i had to choose but i think thatcleinias is the person to be consulted for his is the state whichis going to use these laws 
 cle thank you megillus 
 ath whether in the abstract words are to be many or few is avery foolish question the best form and not the shortest is to beapproved nor is length at all to be regarded of the two forms of lawwhich have been recited the one is not only twice as good inpractical usefulness as the other but the case is like that of thetwo kinds of doctors which i was just now mentioning and yetlegislators never appear to have considered that they have twoinstruments which they might use in andforce for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude they usethe one only as far as they can they do not mingle persuasion withcoercion but employ force pure and simple moreover there is a thirdpoint sweet friends which ought to be and never is regarded in ourexisting laws 
 cle what is it 
 ath a point arising out of our previous discussion which comesinto my mind in some mysterious way all this time from early dawnuntil noon have we been talking about laws in this charmingretreat now we are going to promulgate our laws and what haspreceded was only the prelude of them why do i mention this for all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes andovertures which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to helpthe strain which is to be performed lyric measures and music of everyother kind have preludes framed with wonderful care but of thetruer and higher strain of law and politics no one has ever yetuttered any prelude or composed or published any as though there wasno such thing in nature whereas our present discussion seems to me toimply that there double laws of which we were speaking arenot exactly double but they are in two parts the law and the preludeof the law the arbitrary command which was compared to thecommands of doctors whom we described as of the meaner sort wasthe law pure and simple and that which preceded and was described byour friend here as being hortatory only was although in fact anexhortation likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse fori imagine that all this language of conciliation which the legislatorhas been uttering in the preface of the law was intended to creategoodwill in the person whom he addressed in order that by reasonof this he might more intelligently receive his is to say the law and therefore in my way of speaking this ismore rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of thelaw and i must further proceed to observe that to all his to each separately the legislator should prefix a preamble heshould remember how great will be the difference between as they have or have not such preambles as in the casealready given 
 cle the lawgiver if he asks my opinion will certainly legislatein the form which you advise 
 ath i think that you are right cleinias in affirming that alllaws have preambles and that throughout the whole of this work oflegislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at thebeginning for that which is to follow is most important and it makesall the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or we should be wrong in requiring that all laws small and greatalike should have preambles of the same kind any more than all songsor speeches although they may be natural to all they are notalways necessary and whether they are to be employed or not has ineach case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the in the present instance of the lawgiver 
 cle that i think is most true and now stranger without delay letus return to the argument and as people say in play make a secondand better beginning if you please with the principles which we havebeen laying down which we never thought of regarding as a preamblebefore but of which we may now make a preamble and not merelyconsider them to be chance topics of discourse let us that we have a preamble about the honour of the gods and therespect of parents enough has been already said and we may proceedto the topics which follow next in order until the preamble is deemedby you to be complete and after that you shall go through the lawsthemselves 
 ath i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficientpreamble about gods and and about parents living or now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the lightof day 
 cle exactly 
 ath after this as is meet and for the interest of us all i thespeaker and you the listeners will try to estimate all thatrelates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens asregards both their occupations and arrive as far as in us lies atthe nature of education these then are the topics which follow nextin order 
 cle very good

 athenian stranger listen all ye who have just now heard the lawsabout gods and about our dear all the things whicha man has next to the gods his soul is the most divine and mosttruly his own now in every man there are two parts the better andsuperior which rules and the worse and inferior which serves andthe ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the i am right in bidding every one next to the gods who areour masters and those who in order follow them the demons tohonour his own soul which every one seems to honour but no onehonours as he ought for honour is a divine good and no evil thing ishonourable and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word orgift or any sort of compliance without making her in any way to honour her but honours her not at all for example everyman from his very boyhood fancies that he is able to knoweverything and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her andhe is very ready to let her do whatever she may like but i mean tosay that in acting thus he injures his soul and is far from honouringher whereas in our opinion he ought to honour her as second only tothe gods again when a man thinks that others are to be blamed andnot himself for the errors which he has committed from time totime and the many and great evils which befell him in is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent he isunder the idea that he is honouring his soul whereas the very reverseis the fact for he is really injuring her and when disregarding theword and approval of the legislator he indulges in pleasure thenagain he is far from honouring her he only dishonours her andfills her full of evil and remorse or when he does not endure tothe end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which thelegislator approves but gives way before them then by does not honour the soul but by all such conduct he makes her tobe dishonourable nor when he thinks that life at any price is a he honour her but yet once more he dishonours her for thesoul having a notion that the world below is all evil he yields toher and does not resist and teach or convince her that for aught sheknows the world of the gods below instead of being evil may bethe greatest of all goods again when any one prefers beauty tovirtue what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul forsuch a preference implies that the body is more honourable than thesoul and this is false for there is nothing of earthly birth whichis more honourable than the heavenly and he who thinks otherwise ofthe soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderfulpossession nor again when a person is willing or not unwilling toacquire dishonest gains does he then honour his soul with he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough togive in exchange for virtue in a word i may say that he who does notestimate the base and evil the good and noble according to thestandard of the legislator and abstain in every possible way from theone and practise the other to the utmost of his power does not knowthat in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusinghis soul which is the divinest part of man for no one as i may considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty to grow into the likeness of bad men andgrowing like them to fly from the conversation of the good and be cutoff from them and cleave to and follow after the company of thebad and he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such menby nature do and say to one suffering which is not justicebut retribution for justice and the just are noble whereasretribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice and whether aman escape or endure this he is the former case becausehe is not cured while in the latter he perishes in order that therest of mankind may be saved 
 speaking generally our glory is to follow the better and improvethe inferior which is susceptible of improvement as far as this ispossible and of all human possessions the soul is by nature mostinclined to avoid the evil and track out and find the chief when a man has found he should take up his abode with it duringthe remainder of his life wherefore the soul also is second ornext to god in honour and third as every one will perceive comesthe honour of the body in natural order having determined this wehave next to consider that there is a natural honour of the that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit todecide which are which is the business of the legislator and he isuspect would intimate that they are as is not tobe given to the fair body or to the strong or the swift or thetall or to the healthy body although many may think more than to their opposites but the mean states of all thesehabits are by far the safest and most moderate for the one extrememakes the soul braggart and insolent and the other illiberal andbase and money and property and distinction all go to the sametune the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source ofhatreds and divisions among states and individuals and the defectof them is commonly a cause of slavery and therefore i would nothave any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his order that he may leave them as rich as possible for thepossession of great wealth is of no use either to them or to thestate the condition of youth which is free from flattery and atthe same time not in need of the necessaries of life is the bestand most harmonious of all being in accord and agreement with ournature and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow letparents then bequeath to their children not a heap of riches butthe spirit of reverence we indeed fancy that they will inheritreverence from us if we rebuke them when they show a want ofreverence but this quality is not really imparted to them by thepresent style of admonition which only tells them that the youngought always to be reverential a sensible legislator will ratherexhort the elders to reverence the younger and above all to take heedthat no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or sayinganything disgraceful for where old men have no shame there young menwill most certainly be devoid of reverence the best way of trainingthe young is to train yourself at the same time not to admonish to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice he whohonours his kindred and reveres those who share in the same godsand are of the same blood and family may fairly expect that thegods who preside over generation will be propitious to him and willquicken his seed and he who deems the services which his friendsand acquaintances do for him greater and more important than theythemselves deem them and his own favours to them less than theirsto him will have their in the intercourse of life andsurely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens he is byfar the best who rather than the olympic or any other victory ofpeace or war desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws ofhis country and who of all mankind is the person reputed to haveobeyed them best through life in his relations to strangers a manshould consider that a contract is a most holy thing and that allconcerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on theprotection of god than wrongs done to citizens for the no kindred and friends is more to be pitied by gods and also he who is most able to avenge him is most zealousin his cause and he who is most able is the genius and the god of thestranger who follow in the train of zeus the god of strangers andfor this reason he who has a spark of caution in him will do hisbest to pass through life without sinning against the stranger and ofoffences committed whether against strangers or against suppliants is the greatest for the god who witnessedto the agreement made with the suppliant becomes in a specialmanner the guardian of the sufferer and he will certainly notsuffer unavenged 
 thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to actabout his parents and himself and his own affairs and in relationto the state and his friends and kindred both in what concernshis own countrymen and in what concerns the stranger we will nowconsider what manner of man he must be who would best pass throughlife in respect of those other things which are not matters of of praise and blame only in which praise and blame educate a make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are aboutto be imposed 
 truth is the beginning of every good thing both to gods and he who would be blessed and happy should be from the first apartaker of the truth that he may live a true man as long aspossible for then he can be trusted but he is not to be trustedwho loves voluntary falsehood and he who loves involuntaryfalsehood is a fool neither condition is enviable for theuntrustworthy and ignorant has no friend and as time advances hebecomes known and lays up in store for himself isolation in crabbedage when life is on the wane so that whether his children or friendsare alive or not he is equally of honour is he whodoes no injustice and of more than twofold honour if he not onlydoes no injustice himself but hinders others from doing any thefirst may count as one man the second is worth many men because heinforms the rulers of the injustice of others and yet more highlyto be esteemed is he who with the rulers in correcting thecitizens as far as he shall be proclaimed the great and perfectcitizen and bear away the palm of virtue the same praise may begiven about temperance and wisdom and all other goods which may beimparted to others as well as acquired by a man for himself he whoimparts them shall be honoured as the man of men and he who iswilling yet is not able may be allowed the second place but hewho is jealous and will not if he can help allow others to partakein a friendly way of any good is deserving of blame the which he has is not to be undervalued by us because it ispossessed by him but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of ourpower let every man then freely strive for the prize of virtue andlet there be no envy for the unenvious nature increases the greatnessof himself contends in the race blasting the fair fame ofno man but the envious who thinks that he ought to get the better bydefaming others is less energetic himself in the pursuit of truevirtue and reduces his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders ofthem and so he makes the whole city to enter the arena untrained inthe practice of virtue and diminishes her glory as far as in himlies now every man should be valiant but he should also be the cruel or hardly curable or altogether incurable acts ofinjustice done to him by others a man can only escape by fighting anddefending himself and conquering and by never ceasing to punish no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this asto the actions of those who do evil but whose evil is curable in thefirst place let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust ofhis own free will for no man of his own free will would choose topossess the greatest of evils and least of all in the most honourablepart of himself and the soul as we said is of a truth deemed by allmen the most honourable in the soul then which is the mosthonourable part of him no one if he could help would admit orallow to continue the greatest of evils the unrighteous and viciousare always to be pitied in any case and one can afford to forgiveas well as pity him who is curable and refrain and calm not getting into a passion like a woman and but upon him who is incapable of reformation and whollyevil the vials of our wrath should be poured out wherefore i saythat good men ought when occasion demands to be both gentle andpassionate 
 of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men isinnate and which a man is always excusing in himself and nevercorrecting mean what is expressed in the saying that every man bynature is and ought to be his own friend whereas the excessivelove of self is in reality the source to each man of all offences forthe lover is blinded about the beloved so that he judges wrongly ofthe just the good and the honourable and thinks that he oughtalways to prefer himself to the truth but he who would be a great manought to regard not himself or his interests but what is the just act be his own or that of another through asimilar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance iswisdom and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing thinkthat we know all things and because we will not let others act for usin what we do not know we are compelled to act amiss let every man avoid excess of and condescend tofollow a better man than himself not allowing any false shame tostand in the way there are also minor precepts which are oftenrepeated and are quite as useful a man should recollect them andremind himself of them for when a stream is flowing out there shouldbe water flowing in too and recollection flows in while wisdom isdeparting therefore i say that a man should refrain from excesseither of laughter or tears and should exhort his neighbour to do thesame he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy and seek tobehave with propriety whether the genius of his good fortuneremains with him or whether at the crisis of his fate when heseems to be mounting high and steep places the gods oppose him insome of his enterprises still he may ever hope in the case of goodmen that whatever afflictions are to befall them in the future godwill lessen and that present evils he will change for the better andas to the goods which are the opposite of these evils he will notdoubt that they will be added to them and that they will befortunate such should be hopes and such should be theexhortations with which they admonish one another never losing anopportunity but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves andothers of all these things both in jest and earnest 
 enough has now been said of divine matters both as touching thepractices which men ought to follow and as to the sort of persons whothey ought severally to be but of human things we have not as yetspoken and we must for to men we are discoursing and not to and pains and desires are a part of human nature and onthem every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with themost eager interest and therefore we must praise the noblest only as the fairest in appearance but as being one which if aman will only taste and not while still in his youth desert foranother he will find to surpass also in the very thing which we allof us mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less ofpain during the whole of life and this will be plain if a man hasa true taste of them as will be quickly and clearly seen but what isa true taste that we have to learn from the pointbeing what is according to nature and what is not according tonature one life must be compared with another the more pleasurablewith the more painful after this desire to havepleasure but we neither desire nor choose pain and the neutral statewe are ready to take in exchange not for pleasure but for pain andwe also wish for less pain and greater pleasure but less pleasure andgreater pain we do not wish for and an equal balance of either wecannot venture to assert that we should desire and all these differor do not differ severally in number and magnitude and intensity andequality and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects ofchoice in relation to desire and such being the necessary order ofthings we wish for that life in which there are many great andintense elements of pleasure and pain and in which the pleasuresare in excess and do not wish for that in which the opposites again do we wish for that in which the clements of either aresmall and few and feeble and the pains exceed and when as i saidbefore there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life this is to beregarded by us as the balanced life while other lives are preferredby us because they exceed in what we like or are rejected by usbecause they exceed in what we dislike all the lives of men may beregarded by us as bound up in these and we must also consider whatsort of lives we by nature desire and if we wish for any others isay that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperienceof the lives which actually exist 
 now what lives are they and how many in which having searched outand beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites andmaking of them a law choosing i say the dear and the pleasant andthe best and noblest a man may live in the happiest way possible letus say that the temperate life is one kind of life and the rationalanother and the courageous another and the healthful another and tothese four let us oppose four other foolish the intemperate the diseased he who knows the temperate life willdescribe it as in all things gentle having gentle pains and gentlepleasures and placid desires and loves not insane whereas theintemperate life is impetuous in all things and has violent pains andpleasures and vehement and stinging desires and loves utterlyinsane and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures ingreatness and number and frequency hence one of the two lives isnaturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to liveintemperately and if this is true the inference clearly is that noman is voluntarily intemperate but that the whole multitude of menlack temperance in their lives either from ignorance or from want or both and the same holds of the diseased andhealthy life they both have pleasures and pains but in health thepleasure exceeds the pain and in sickness the pain exceeds thepleasure now our intention in choosing the lives is not that thepainful should exceed but the life in which pain is exceeded bypleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life and weshould say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasureand pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate andthe wise life than the foolish life and the life of courage thanthe life of cowardice one of each pair exceeding in pleasure andthe other in pain the courageous surpassing the cowardly and thewise exceeding the foolish and so the one dass of lives exceeds theother class in pleasure the temperate and courageous and wise andhealthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseasedlives and generally speaking that which has any virtue whether ofbody or soul is pleasanter than the vicious life and far superior inbeauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation and causes him wholives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite 
 enough of the preamble and now the laws should follow or to speakmore correctly outline of them as then in the case of a web or anyother tissue the warp and the woof cannot be made of the samematerials but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger andhaving a certain character of firmness whereas the woof is softer andhas a proper degree of a similar manner those who areto hold great offices in states should be distinguished truly in eachcase from those who have been but slenderly proven by education letus suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a creation of offices the other the laws which are assigned to themto administer 
 but before all this comes the following or herdsman or breeder of horses or the like when he hasreceived his animals will not begin to train them until he has firstpurified them in a manner which befits a community of animals he willdivide the healthy and unhealthy and the good breed and the badbreed and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other tend the rest reflecting that his labours will be vain and haveno effect either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature andill nurture have corrupted and that they will involve indestruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every otheranimal if he should neglect to purify them now the case of otheranimals is not so are only worth introducing for thesake of illustration but what relates to man is of the highestimportance and the legislator should make enquiries and indicatewhat is proper for each one in the way of purification and of anyother procedure take for example the purification of a many kinds of purification some easier and others more some of them and the best and most difficult of them thelegislator if he be also a despot may be able to effect but thelegislator who not being a despot sets up a new government andlaws even if he attempt the mildest of purgations may thinkhimself happy if he can complete his work the best kind ofpurification is painful like similar cures in medicine involvingrighteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who areincurable and are the greatest injury of the whole state but themilder form of purification is as men who havenothing and are in want of food show a disposition to follow theirleaders in an attack on the property of the who are thenatural plague of the state are sent away by the legislator in afriendly spirit as far as he is able and this dismissal of them iseuphemistically termed a colony and every legislator shouldcontrive to do this at once our present case however is there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separationunder the circumstances in which we are placed but as when manystreams flow together from many sources whether springs or mountaintorrents into a single lake we ought to attend and take care thatthe confluent waters should be perfectly clear and in order to effectthis should pump and draw off and divert impurities so in everypolitical arrangement there may be trouble and danger but seeingthat we are now only discoursing and not acting let our selectionbe supposed to be completed and the desired purity attained touchingevil men who want to join and be citizens of our state after we havetested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient will prevent them from coming but the good we will to the utmostof our ability receive as friends with open arms 
 another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten which as wewere saying the heraclid colony had and which is also wehave escaped division of land and the abolition of debts for theseare always a source of dangerous contention and a city which isdriven by necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allowthe old ways to continue nor yet venture to alter them we musthave recourse to prayers so to speak and hope that a slight changemay be cautiously effected in a length of time and such a changecan be accomplished by those who have abundance of land and havingalso many debtors are willing in a kindly spirit to share withthose who are in want sometimes remitting and sometimes fast in a path of moderation and deeming poverty to be theincrease of a desires and not the diminution of his this is the great beginning of salvation to a state and upon thislasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order issuitable under the circumstances but if the change be based upon anunsound principle the future administration of the country will befull of difficulties that is a danger which as i am saying isescaped by us and yet we had better say how if we had not might have escaped and we may venture now to assert that noother way of escape whether narrow or broad can be devised butfreedom from avarice and a sense of this rock our cityshall be built for there ought to be no disputes among citizens aboutproperty if there are quarrels of long standing among them nolegislator of any degree of sense will proceed a step in thearrangement of the state until they are settled but that they to whomgod has given as he has to us to be the founders of a new state asyet free from they should create themselves enmities bytheir mode of distributing lands and houses would be superhuman follyand wickedness 
 how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land in thefirst place the number of the citizens has to be determined and alsothe number and size of the divisions into which they will have to beformed and the land and the houses will then have to be apportionedby us as fairly as we can the number of citizens can only beestimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and theneighbouring states the territory must be sufficient to maintain acertain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of than thisis not required and the number of citizens should be sufficient todefend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours andalso to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to theirneighbours when they are wronged after having taken a survey oftheirs and their neighbours territory we will determine the limitsof them in fact as well as in theory and now let us proceed tolegislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our number of our citizens shall be this will be a convenientnumber and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of theallotment the houses and the land will be divided in the same way sothat every man may correspond to a lot let the whole number befirst divided into two parts and then into three and the number isfurther capable of being divided into four or five parts or anynumber of parts up to ten every legislator ought to know so mucharithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to beuseful to all cities and we are going to take that number whichcontains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series ofdivisions the whole of number has every possible division and thenumber can be divided by exactly divisors and tenof these proceed without interval from one to ten this will furnishnumbers for war and peace and for all contracts and taxes and divisions of the land these properties ofnumber should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound bylaw to know them for they are true and should be proclaimed at thefoundation of the city with a view to use whether the legislatoris establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one inrespect of gods and temples which are to be built ineach city and the gods or after whom they are to he be a man of sense he will make no change in anythingwhich the oracle of delphi or dodona or the god ammon or anyancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner whether byapparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven in obedience to whichmankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic originating on the spot or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus orsome other place and on the strength of which traditions they haveconsecrated oracles and images and altars and temples andportioned out a sacred domain for each of them the least part ofall these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator but he shouldassign to the several districts some god or or hero the distribution of the soil should give to these first theirchosen domain and all things fitting that the inhabitants of theseveral districts may meet at fixed times and that they may readilysupply their various wants and entertain one another with become friends and acquaintances for there is no greater goodin a state than that the citizens should be known to one another whennot light but darkness and ignorance of each charactersprevails among them no one will receive the honour of which he isdeserving or the power or the justice to which he is fairly in every state above all things every man should takeheed that he have no deceit in him but that he be always true andsimple and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him 
 the next move in our pastime of legislation like the withdrawalof the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts being anunusual one will probably excite wonder when mentioned for thefirst time and yet if a man will only reflect and weigh the matterwith care he will see that our city is ordered in a manner not the best is the second best perhaps also some one may notapprove this form because he thinks that such a constitution is illadapted to a legislator who has not despotic power the truth is thatthere are three forms of government the best the second and thethird best which we may just mention and then leave the selection tothe ruler of the settlement following this method in the presentinstance let us speak of the states which are respectively and third in excellence and then we will leave the choiceto cleinias now or to any one else who may hereafter have to make asimilar choice among constitutions and may desire to give to hisstate some feature which is congenial to him and which he approvesin his own country 
 the first and highest form of the state and of the government and ofthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancientsaying that friends have all things in common whether there isanywhere now or will ever be this communion of women and childrenand of property in which the private and individual is altogetherbanished from life and things which are by nature private such aseyes and ears and hands have become common and in some way see andhear and act in common and all men express praise and blame andfeel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and whatever laws there areunite the city to the all this is possible or not isay that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitutea state which will be truer or better or more exalted in such a state is governed by gods or sons of gods one or morethan one happy are the men who living after this manner dwellthere and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of thestate and to cling to this and to seek with all our might for onewhich is like this the state which we have now in hand when be nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the secondplace and after that by the grace of god we will complete the thirdone and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of thesecond 
 let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses and nottill the land in common since a community of goods goes beyondtheir proposed origin and nurture and education but in making thedistribution let the several possessors feel that their particularlots also belong to the whole city and seeing that the earth is theirparent let them tend her more carefully than children do theirmother for she is a goddess and their queen and they are hermortal subjects such also are the feelings which they ought toentertain to the gods and of the country and in orderthat the distribution may always remain they ought to considerfurther that the present number of families should be always neither increased nor diminished this may be secured for thewhole city in the following the possessor of a lot leavethe one of his children who is his best beloved and one only to bethe heir of his dwelling and his successor in the duty of ministeringto the gods the state and the family as well the living members ofit as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance butof his other children if he have more than one he shall give thefemales in marriage according to the law to be hereafter the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who haveno children and are disposed to receive them or if there should benone such and particular individuals have too many children maleor female or too few as in the case of all these caseslet the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge anddetermine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient anddevise a means that the number of houses shall always remainthe same there are many ways of regulating numbers for they inwhom generation is affluent may be made to refrain and on theother hand special care may be taken to increase the number of birthsby rewards and stigmas or we may meet the evil by the elder mengiving advice and administering rebuke to the this waythe object may be attained and if after all there be very greatdifficulty about the equal preservation of the houses andthere be an excess of citizens owing to the too great love of thosewho live together and we are at our wits end there is still the olddevice often mentioned by us of sending out a colony which willpart friends with us and be composed of suitable persons if onthe other hand there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease or aplague of war and the inhabitants become much fewer than theappointed number by reason of bereavement we ought not to introducecitizens of spurious birth and education if this can be even god is said not to be able to fight against necessity 
 wherefore let us suppose this high argument of ours to addressus in the following of men cease not to honouraccording to nature similarity and equality and sameness andagreement as regards number and every good and noble quality all observe the aforesaid number throughout life in thesecond place do not disparage the small and modest proportions of theinheritances which you received in the distribution by buying andselling them to one another for then neither will the god who gaveyou the lot be your friend nor will the legislator and indeed thelaw declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which hemay or may not take the lot in the first place the earth as he isinformed is sacred to the gods and in the next place priests andpriestesses will offer up prayers over a first and second and even athird sacrifice that he who buys or sells the houses or lands whichhe has received may suffer the punishment which he deserves andthese their prayers they shall write down in the temples on tabletsof for the instruction of posterity moreover theywill set a watch over all these things that they may be which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that anyinfringement of these commands may be discovered and punished asoffences both against the law and the god how great is the benefit ofsuch an ordinance to all those cities which obey and are administeredaccordingly no bad man can ever know as the old proverb says butonly a man of experience and good habits for in such an order ofthings there will not be much opportunity for making money no maneither ought or indeed will be allowed to exercise any ignobleoccupation of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to afreeman and should never want to acquire riches by any such means 
 further the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed topossess gold and silver but only coin for daily use which isalmost necessary in dealing with artisans and for payment ofhirelings whether slaves or immigrants by all those persons whorequire the use of them wherefore our citizens as we say shouldhave a coin passing current among themselves but not accepted amongthe rest of mankind with a view however to expeditions and journeysto other embassies or for any other occasion which mayarise of sending out a herald the state must also possess a commonhellenic currency if a private person is ever obliged to go him have the consent of the magistrates and go and if when hereturns he has any foreign money remaining let him give the surplusback to the treasury and receive a corresponding sum in the localcurrency and if he is discovered to appropriate it let it beconfiscated and let him who knows and does not inform be subject tocurse and dishonour equally him who brought the money and also to afine not less in amount than the foreign money which has beenbrought back in marrying and giving in marriage no one shall give orreceive any dowry at all and no one shall deposit money withanother whom he does not trust as a friend nor shall he lend moneyupon interest and the borrower should be under no obligation to repayeither capital or interest that these principles are best any onemay see who compares them with the first principle and intention ofa state the intention as we affirm of a reasonable statesman isnot what the many declare to be the object of a good that the state for the true interests of which he isadvising should be as great and as rich as possible and shouldpossess gold and silver and have the greatest empire by sea they imagine to be the real object of legislation at thesame time adding inconsistently that the true legislator desiresto have the city the best and happiest possible but they do not seethat some of these things are possible and some of them areimpossible and he who orders the state will desire what ispossible and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts toaccomplish that which is impossible the citizen must indeed behappy and good and the legislator will seek to make him so butvery rich and very good at the same time he cannot be not atleast in the sense in which the many speak of riches for they meanby the rich the few who have the most valuable possessions althoughthe owner of them may quite well be a rogue and if this is true ican never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be be good as well as rich and good in a high degree and rich in ahigh degree at the same time he cannot be some one will ask whynot and we shall acquisitions which come fromsources which are just and unjust indifferently are more thandouble those which come from just sources only and the sums which areexpended neither honourably nor disgracefully are only half asgreat as those which are expended honourably and on honourablepurposes thus if the one acquires double and spends half theother who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly bewealthier than he the am speaking of the saver and not of not always bad he may indeed in some cases be utterly as i was saying a good man he never is for he who receivesmoney unjustly as well as justly and spends neither nor be a rich man if he be also thrifty on the other hand theutterly bad is in general profligate and therefore very poor whilehe who spends on noble objects and acquires wealth by just meansonly can hardly be remarkable for riches any more than he can bevery poor our statement then is true that the very rich are notgood and if they are not good they are not happy but the intentionof our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be and asfriendly as possible to one another and men who are always at lawwith one another and amongst whom there are many wrongs done cannever be friends to one another but only those among whom crimesand lawsuits are few and slight therefore we say that gold and silverought not to be allowed in the city nor much of the vulgar sort oftrade which is carried on by lending money or rearing the meanerkinds of live stock but only the produce of agriculture and onlyso much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect thatfor the sake of which riches mean soul and body whichwithout gymnastics and without education will never be worthanything and therefore as we have said not once but many care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts forthere are in all three things about which every man has an the interest about money when rightly regarded is the thirdand lowest of them midway comes the interest of the body of all that of the soul and the state which we aredescribing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honoursaccording to this scale but if in any of the laws which have beenordained health has been preferred to temperance or wealth to healthand temperate habits that law must clearly be wrong wherefore legislator ought often to impress upon himself do i want and do i attain my aim or do i miss themark in this way and in this way only he ma acquit himself andfree others from the work of legislation 
 let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we havementioned 
 it would be well that every man should come to the colony having allthings equal but seeing that this is not possible and one man willhave greater possessions than another for many reasons and inparticular in order to preserve equality in special crises of thestate qualifications of property must be unequal in order thatoffices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to thevalue of each wealth and not solely to the virtue of hisancestors or himself nor yet to the strength and beauty of hisperson but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty and so bya law of inequality which will be in proportion to his wealth hewill receive honours and offices as equally as possible and therewill be no quarrels and disputes to which end there should be fourdifferent standards appointed according to the amount of should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth which the citizens will be placed and they will be called by theseor similar names they may continue in the same rank or pass intoanother in any individual case on becoming richer from being poorer from being richer the form of law which i should propose asthe natural sequel would be as a state which is desirousof being saved from the greatest of all faction butrather should exist among the citizens neitherextreme poverty nor again excess of wealth for both are productiveof both these evils now the legislator should determine what is to bethe limit of poverty or wealth let the limit of poverty be thevalue of the lot this ought to be preserved and no ruler nor anyone else who aspires after a reputation for virtue will allow the lotto be impaired in any case this the legislator gives as a he will permit a man to acquire double or triple or as much asfour times the amount of this but if a person have yet greaterriches whether he has found them or they have been given to he has made them in business or has acquired by any stroke offortune that which is in excess of the measure if he give back thesurplus to the state and to the gods who are the patrons of thestate he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation but if hedisobeys this our law any one who likes may inform against him andreceive half the value of the excess and the delinquent shall pay asum equal to the excess out of his own property and the other half ofthe excess shall belong to the gods and let every possession of everyman with the exception of the lot be publicly registered beforethe magistrates whom the law appoints so that all suits about moneymay be easy and quite simple 
 the next thing to be noted is that the city should be placed asnearly as possible in the centre of the country we should choose aplace which possesses what is suitable for a city and this may easilybe imagined and described then we will divide the city into twelveportions first founding temples to hestia to zeus and to a spot which we will call the acropolis and surround with acircular wall making the division of the entire city and countryradiate from this point the twelve portions shall be equalized by theprovision that those which are of good land shall be smaller whilethose of inferior quality shall be larger the number of the lotsshall be and each of them shall be divided into two and everyallotment shall be composed of two such sections one of land near thecity the other of land which is at a distance this arrangement shallbe carried out in the following manner the section which is nearthe city shall be added to that which is on borders and form one the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portionwhich is next farthest and so of the rest moreover in the twosections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soilought to be maintained the badness and goodness shall becompensated by more and less and the legislator shall divide thecitizens into twelve parts and arrange the rest of their property asfar as possible so as to form twelve equal parts and there shallbe a registration of all after this they shall assign twelve lotsto twelve gods and call them by their names and dedicate to each godtheir several portions and call the tribes after them and they shalldistribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in whichthey divided the country and every man shall have two in the centre of the country and the other at the of the manner of settlement 
 now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such ahappy concurrence of circumstances as we have described neither canall things coincide as they are wanted men who will not takeoffence at such a mode of living together and will endure all theirlife long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit and tobeget children in accordance with our ordinances and will allowthemselves to be deprived of gold and other things which thelegislator as is evident from these enactments will certainly forbidthem and will endure further the situation of the land with thecity in the middle and dwellings round this is as if thelegislator were telling his dreams or making a city and citizens ofwax there is truth in these objections and therefore every oneshould take to heart what i am going to say once more then thelegislator shall appear and address my friends he will say tous do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree oftruth in your words but i am of opinion that in matters which arenot present but future he who exhibits a pattern of that at whichhe aims should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest andthat if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution heshould avoid and not execute it but he should contrive to carry outthat which is nearest and most akin to it you must allow thelegislator to perfect his design and when it is perfected you shouldjoin with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedientand what will arouse opposition for surely the artist who is to bedeemed worthy of any regard at all ought always to make his 
 having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelveparts let us now see in what way this may be accomplished there isno difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of thegreatest number of divisions of that which they include or inseeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them and areproduced out of them up to wherefore the law ought to orderphratries and demes and villages and also military ranks andmovements as well as coins and measures dry and liquid and as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another nor shouldwe fear the appearance of minuteness if the law commands that all thevessels which a man possesses should have a common measure when weconsider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have ause in respect of all the variations of which they are in themselves and as measures of height and depth and in allsounds and in motions as well those which proceed in a straightdirection upwards or downwards as in those which go round and legislator is to consider all these things and to bid thecitizens as far as possible not to lose sight of numerical no single instrument of youthful education has such mightypower both as regards domestic economy and politics and in the the study of arithmetic above all arithmetic stirs up him whois by nature sleepy and dull and makes him quick to learn and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond hisnatural powers all such things if only the legislator by other lawsand institutions can banish meanness and covetousness from thesouls of men so that they can use them properly and to their owngood will be excellent and suitable instruments of education butif he cannot he will unintentionally create in them instead ofwisdom the habit of craft which evil tendency may be observed in theegyptians and phoenicians and many other races through the generalvulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions whether some unworthylegislator theirs has been the cause or some impediment of chanceor nature for we must not fail to observe o megillus and there is a difference in places and that some beget better menand others worse and we must legislate accordingly some places aresubject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds andviolent heats some by reason of waters or again from the characterof the food given by the earth which not only affects the bodies ofmen for good or evil but produces similar results in their souls andin all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divineinspiration and in which the have their appointed lots andare propitious not adverse to the settlers in them to all thesematters the legislator if he have any sense in him will attend asfar as man can and frame his laws accordingly and this is whatyou cleinias must do and to matters of this kind you must turn yourmind since you are going to colonize a new country

 athenian stranger listen all ye who have just now heard the lawsabout gods and about our dear all the things whicha man has next to the gods his soul is the most divine and mosttruly his own now in every man there are two parts the better andsuperior which rules and the worse and inferior which serves andthe ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the i am right in bidding every one next to the gods who areour masters and those who in order follow them the demons tohonour his own soul which every one seems to honour but no onehonours as he ought for honour is a divine good and no evil thing ishonourable and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word orgift or any sort of compliance without making her in any way to honour her but honours her not at all for example everyman from his very boyhood fancies that he is able to knoweverything and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her andhe is very ready to let her do whatever she may like but i mean tosay that in acting thus he injures his soul and is far from honouringher whereas in our opinion he ought to honour her as second only tothe gods again when a man thinks that others are to be blamed andnot himself for the errors which he has committed from time totime and the many and great evils which befell him in is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent he isunder the idea that he is honouring his soul whereas the very reverseis the fact for he is really injuring her and when disregarding theword and approval of the legislator he indulges in pleasure thenagain he is far from honouring her he only dishonours her andfills her full of evil and remorse or when he does not endure tothe end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which thelegislator approves but gives way before them then by does not honour the soul but by all such conduct he makes her tobe dishonourable nor when he thinks that life at any price is a he honour her but yet once more he dishonours her for thesoul having a notion that the world below is all evil he yields toher and does not resist and teach or convince her that for aught sheknows the world of the gods below instead of being evil may bethe greatest of all goods again when any one prefers beauty tovirtue what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul forsuch a preference implies that the body is more honourable than thesoul and this is false for there is nothing of earthly birth whichis more honourable than the heavenly and he who thinks otherwise ofthe soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderfulpossession nor again when a person is willing or not unwilling toacquire dishonest gains does he then honour his soul with he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough togive in exchange for virtue in a word i may say that he who does notestimate the base and evil the good and noble according to thestandard of the legislator and abstain in every possible way from theone and practise the other to the utmost of his power does not knowthat in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusinghis soul which is the divinest part of man for no one as i may considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty to grow into the likeness of bad men andgrowing like them to fly from the conversation of the good and be cutoff from them and cleave to and follow after the company of thebad and he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such menby nature do and say to one suffering which is not justicebut retribution for justice and the just are noble whereasretribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice and whether aman escape or endure this he is the former case becausehe is not cured while in the latter he perishes in order that therest of mankind may be saved 
 speaking generally our glory is to follow the better and improvethe inferior which is susceptible of improvement as far as this ispossible and of all human possessions the soul is by nature mostinclined to avoid the evil and track out and find the chief when a man has found he should take up his abode with it duringthe remainder of his life wherefore the soul also is second ornext to god in honour and third as every one will perceive comesthe honour of the body in natural order having determined this wehave next to consider that there is a natural honour of the that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit todecide which are which is the business of the legislator and he isuspect would intimate that they are as is not tobe given to the fair body or to the strong or the swift or thetall or to the healthy body although many may think more than to their opposites but the mean states of all thesehabits are by far the safest and most moderate for the one extrememakes the soul braggart and insolent and the other illiberal andbase and money and property and distinction all go to the sametune the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source ofhatreds and divisions among states and individuals and the defectof them is commonly a cause of slavery and therefore i would nothave any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his order that he may leave them as rich as possible for thepossession of great wealth is of no use either to them or to thestate the condition of youth which is free from flattery and atthe same time not in need of the necessaries of life is the bestand most harmonious of all being in accord and agreement with ournature and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow letparents then bequeath to their children not a heap of riches butthe spirit of reverence we indeed fancy that they will inheritreverence from us if we rebuke them when they show a want ofreverence but this quality is not really imparted to them by thepresent style of admonition which only tells them that the youngought always to be reverential a sensible legislator will ratherexhort the elders to reverence the younger and above all to take heedthat no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or sayinganything disgraceful for where old men have no shame there young menwill most certainly be devoid of reverence the best way of trainingthe young is to train yourself at the same time not to admonish to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice he whohonours his kindred and reveres those who share in the same godsand are of the same blood and family may fairly expect that thegods who preside over generation will be propitious to him and willquicken his seed and he who deems the services which his friendsand acquaintances do for him greater and more important than theythemselves deem them and his own favours to them less than theirsto him will have their in the intercourse of life andsurely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens he is byfar the best who rather than the olympic or any other victory ofpeace or war desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws ofhis country and who of all mankind is the person reputed to haveobeyed them best through life in his relations to strangers a manshould consider that a contract is a most holy thing and that allconcerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on theprotection of god than wrongs done to citizens for the no kindred and friends is more to be pitied by gods and also he who is most able to avenge him is most zealousin his cause and he who is most able is the genius and the god of thestranger who follow in the train of zeus the god of strangers andfor this reason he who has a spark of caution in him will do hisbest to pass through life without sinning against the stranger and ofoffences committed whether against strangers or against suppliants is the greatest for the god who witnessedto the agreement made with the suppliant becomes in a specialmanner the guardian of the sufferer and he will certainly notsuffer unavenged 
 thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to actabout his parents and himself and his own affairs and in relationto the state and his friends and kindred both in what concernshis own countrymen and in what concerns the stranger we will nowconsider what manner of man he must be who would best pass throughlife in respect of those other things which are not matters of of praise and blame only in which praise and blame educate a make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are aboutto be imposed 
 truth is the beginning of every good thing both to gods and he who would be blessed and happy should be from the first apartaker of the truth that he may live a true man as long aspossible for then he can be trusted but he is not to be trustedwho loves voluntary falsehood and he who loves involuntaryfalsehood is a fool neither condition is enviable for theuntrustworthy and ignorant has no friend and as time advances hebecomes known and lays up in store for himself isolation in crabbedage when life is on the wane so that whether his children or friendsare alive or not he is equally of honour is he whodoes no injustice and of more than twofold honour if he not onlydoes no injustice himself but hinders others from doing any thefirst may count as one man the second is worth many men because heinforms the rulers of the injustice of others and yet more highlyto be esteemed is he who with the rulers in correcting thecitizens as far as he shall be proclaimed the great and perfectcitizen and bear away the palm of virtue the same praise may begiven about temperance and wisdom and all other goods which may beimparted to others as well as acquired by a man for himself he whoimparts them shall be honoured as the man of men and he who iswilling yet is not able may be allowed the second place but hewho is jealous and will not if he can help allow others to partakein a friendly way of any good is deserving of blame the which he has is not to be undervalued by us because it ispossessed by him but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of ourpower let every man then freely strive for the prize of virtue andlet there be no envy for the unenvious nature increases the greatnessof himself contends in the race blasting the fair fame ofno man but the envious who thinks that he ought to get the better bydefaming others is less energetic himself in the pursuit of truevirtue and reduces his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders ofthem and so he makes the whole city to enter the arena untrained inthe practice of virtue and diminishes her glory as far as in himlies now every man should be valiant but he should also be the cruel or hardly curable or altogether incurable acts ofinjustice done to him by others a man can only escape by fighting anddefending himself and conquering and by never ceasing to punish no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this asto the actions of those who do evil but whose evil is curable in thefirst place let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust ofhis own free will for no man of his own free will would choose topossess the greatest of evils and least of all in the most honourablepart of himself and the soul as we said is of a truth deemed by allmen the most honourable in the soul then which is the mosthonourable part of him no one if he could help would admit orallow to continue the greatest of evils the unrighteous and viciousare always to be pitied in any case and one can afford to forgiveas well as pity him who is curable and refrain and calm not getting into a passion like a woman and but upon him who is incapable of reformation and whollyevil the vials of our wrath should be poured out wherefore i saythat good men ought when occasion demands to be both gentle andpassionate 
 of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men isinnate and which a man is always excusing in himself and nevercorrecting mean what is expressed in the saying that every man bynature is and ought to be his own friend whereas the excessivelove of self is in reality the source to each man of all offences forthe lover is blinded about the beloved so that he judges wrongly ofthe just the good and the honourable and thinks that he oughtalways to prefer himself to the truth but he who would be a great manought to regard not himself or his interests but what is the just act be his own or that of another through asimilar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance iswisdom and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing thinkthat we know all things and because we will not let others act for usin what we do not know we are compelled to act amiss let every man avoid excess of and condescend tofollow a better man than himself not allowing any false shame tostand in the way there are also minor precepts which are oftenrepeated and are quite as useful a man should recollect them andremind himself of them for when a stream is flowing out there shouldbe water flowing in too and recollection flows in while wisdom isdeparting therefore i say that a man should refrain from excesseither of laughter or tears and should exhort his neighbour to do thesame he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy and seek tobehave with propriety whether the genius of his good fortuneremains with him or whether at the crisis of his fate when heseems to be mounting high and steep places the gods oppose him insome of his enterprises still he may ever hope in the case of goodmen that whatever afflictions are to befall them in the future godwill lessen and that present evils he will change for the better andas to the goods which are the opposite of these evils he will notdoubt that they will be added to them and that they will befortunate such should be hopes and such should be theexhortations with which they admonish one another never losing anopportunity but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves andothers of all these things both in jest and earnest 
 enough has now been said of divine matters both as touching thepractices which men ought to follow and as to the sort of persons whothey ought severally to be but of human things we have not as yetspoken and we must for to men we are discoursing and not to and pains and desires are a part of human nature and onthem every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with themost eager interest and therefore we must praise the noblest only as the fairest in appearance but as being one which if aman will only taste and not while still in his youth desert foranother he will find to surpass also in the very thing which we allof us mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less ofpain during the whole of life and this will be plain if a man hasa true taste of them as will be quickly and clearly seen but what isa true taste that we have to learn from the pointbeing what is according to nature and what is not according tonature one life must be compared with another the more pleasurablewith the more painful after this desire to havepleasure but we neither desire nor choose pain and the neutral statewe are ready to take in exchange not for pleasure but for pain andwe also wish for less pain and greater pleasure but less pleasure andgreater pain we do not wish for and an equal balance of either wecannot venture to assert that we should desire and all these differor do not differ severally in number and magnitude and intensity andequality and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects ofchoice in relation to desire and such being the necessary order ofthings we wish for that life in which there are many great andintense elements of pleasure and pain and in which the pleasuresare in excess and do not wish for that in which the opposites again do we wish for that in which the clements of either aresmall and few and feeble and the pains exceed and when as i saidbefore there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life this is to beregarded by us as the balanced life while other lives are preferredby us because they exceed in what we like or are rejected by usbecause they exceed in what we dislike all the lives of men may beregarded by us as bound up in these and we must also consider whatsort of lives we by nature desire and if we wish for any others isay that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperienceof the lives which actually exist 
 now what lives are they and how many in which having searched outand beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites andmaking of them a law choosing i say the dear and the pleasant andthe best and noblest a man may live in the happiest way possible letus say that the temperate life is one kind of life and the rationalanother and the courageous another and the healthful another and tothese four let us oppose four other foolish the intemperate the diseased he who knows the temperate life willdescribe it as in all things gentle having gentle pains and gentlepleasures and placid desires and loves not insane whereas theintemperate life is impetuous in all things and has violent pains andpleasures and vehement and stinging desires and loves utterlyinsane and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures ingreatness and number and frequency hence one of the two lives isnaturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to liveintemperately and if this is true the inference clearly is that noman is voluntarily intemperate but that the whole multitude of menlack temperance in their lives either from ignorance or from want or both and the same holds of the diseased andhealthy life they both have pleasures and pains but in health thepleasure exceeds the pain and in sickness the pain exceeds thepleasure now our intention in choosing the lives is not that thepainful should exceed but the life in which pain is exceeded bypleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life and weshould say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasureand pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate andthe wise life than the foolish life and the life of courage thanthe life of cowardice one of each pair exceeding in pleasure andthe other in pain the courageous surpassing the cowardly and thewise exceeding the foolish and so the one dass of lives exceeds theother class in pleasure the temperate and courageous and wise andhealthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseasedlives and generally speaking that which has any virtue whether ofbody or soul is pleasanter than the vicious life and far superior inbeauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation and causes him wholives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite 
 enough of the preamble and now the laws should follow or to speakmore correctly outline of them as then in the case of a web or anyother tissue the warp and the woof cannot be made of the samematerials but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger andhaving a certain character of firmness whereas the woof is softer andhas a proper degree of a similar manner those who areto hold great offices in states should be distinguished truly in eachcase from those who have been but slenderly proven by education letus suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a creation of offices the other the laws which are assigned to themto administer 
 but before all this comes the following or herdsman or breeder of horses or the like when he hasreceived his animals will not begin to train them until he has firstpurified them in a manner which befits a community of animals he willdivide the healthy and unhealthy and the good breed and the badbreed and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other tend the rest reflecting that his labours will be vain and haveno effect either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature andill nurture have corrupted and that they will involve indestruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every otheranimal if he should neglect to purify them now the case of otheranimals is not so are only worth introducing for thesake of illustration but what relates to man is of the highestimportance and the legislator should make enquiries and indicatewhat is proper for each one in the way of purification and of anyother procedure take for example the purification of a many kinds of purification some easier and others more some of them and the best and most difficult of them thelegislator if he be also a despot may be able to effect but thelegislator who not being a despot sets up a new government andlaws even if he attempt the mildest of purgations may thinkhimself happy if he can complete his work the best kind ofpurification is painful like similar cures in medicine involvingrighteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who areincurable and are the greatest injury of the whole state but themilder form of purification is as men who havenothing and are in want of food show a disposition to follow theirleaders in an attack on the property of the who are thenatural plague of the state are sent away by the legislator in afriendly spirit as far as he is able and this dismissal of them iseuphemistically termed a colony and every legislator shouldcontrive to do this at once our present case however is there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separationunder the circumstances in which we are placed but as when manystreams flow together from many sources whether springs or mountaintorrents into a single lake we ought to attend and take care thatthe confluent waters should be perfectly clear and in order to effectthis should pump and draw off and divert impurities so in everypolitical arrangement there may be trouble and danger but seeingthat we are now only discoursing and not acting let our selectionbe supposed to be completed and the desired purity attained touchingevil men who want to join and be citizens of our state after we havetested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient will prevent them from coming but the good we will to the utmostof our ability receive as friends with open arms 
 another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten which as wewere saying the heraclid colony had and which is also wehave escaped division of land and the abolition of debts for theseare always a source of dangerous contention and a city which isdriven by necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allowthe old ways to continue nor yet venture to alter them we musthave recourse to prayers so to speak and hope that a slight changemay be cautiously effected in a length of time and such a changecan be accomplished by those who have abundance of land and havingalso many debtors are willing in a kindly spirit to share withthose who are in want sometimes remitting and sometimes fast in a path of moderation and deeming poverty to be theincrease of a desires and not the diminution of his this is the great beginning of salvation to a state and upon thislasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order issuitable under the circumstances but if the change be based upon anunsound principle the future administration of the country will befull of difficulties that is a danger which as i am saying isescaped by us and yet we had better say how if we had not might have escaped and we may venture now to assert that noother way of escape whether narrow or broad can be devised butfreedom from avarice and a sense of this rock our cityshall be built for there ought to be no disputes among citizens aboutproperty if there are quarrels of long standing among them nolegislator of any degree of sense will proceed a step in thearrangement of the state until they are settled but that they to whomgod has given as he has to us to be the founders of a new state asyet free from they should create themselves enmities bytheir mode of distributing lands and houses would be superhuman follyand wickedness 
 how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land in thefirst place the number of the citizens has to be determined and alsothe number and size of the divisions into which they will have to beformed and the land and the houses will then have to be apportionedby us as fairly as we can the number of citizens can only beestimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and theneighbouring states the territory must be sufficient to maintain acertain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of than thisis not required and the number of citizens should be sufficient todefend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours andalso to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to theirneighbours when they are wronged after having taken a survey oftheirs and their neighbours territory we will determine the limitsof them in fact as well as in theory and now let us proceed tolegislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our number of our citizens shall be this will be a convenientnumber and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of theallotment the houses and the land will be divided in the same way sothat every man may correspond to a lot let the whole number befirst divided into two parts and then into three and the number isfurther capable of being divided into four or five parts or anynumber of parts up to ten every legislator ought to know so mucharithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to beuseful to all cities and we are going to take that number whichcontains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series ofdivisions the whole of number has every possible division and thenumber can be divided by exactly divisors and tenof these proceed without interval from one to ten this will furnishnumbers for war and peace and for all contracts and taxes and divisions of the land these properties ofnumber should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound bylaw to know them for they are true and should be proclaimed at thefoundation of the city with a view to use whether the legislatoris establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one inrespect of gods and temples which are to be built ineach city and the gods or after whom they are to he be a man of sense he will make no change in anythingwhich the oracle of delphi or dodona or the god ammon or anyancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner whether byapparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven in obedience to whichmankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic originating on the spot or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus orsome other place and on the strength of which traditions they haveconsecrated oracles and images and altars and temples andportioned out a sacred domain for each of them the least part ofall these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator but he shouldassign to the several districts some god or or hero the distribution of the soil should give to these first theirchosen domain and all things fitting that the inhabitants of theseveral districts may meet at fixed times and that they may readilysupply their various wants and entertain one another with become friends and acquaintances for there is no greater goodin a state than that the citizens should be known to one another whennot light but darkness and ignorance of each charactersprevails among them no one will receive the honour of which he isdeserving or the power or the justice to which he is fairly in every state above all things every man should takeheed that he have no deceit in him but that he be always true andsimple and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him 
 the next move in our pastime of legislation like the withdrawalof the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts being anunusual one will probably excite wonder when mentioned for thefirst time and yet if a man will only reflect and weigh the matterwith care he will see that our city is ordered in a manner not the best is the second best perhaps also some one may notapprove this form because he thinks that such a constitution is illadapted to a legislator who has not despotic power the truth is thatthere are three forms of government the best the second and thethird best which we may just mention and then leave the selection tothe ruler of the settlement following this method in the presentinstance let us speak of the states which are respectively and third in excellence and then we will leave the choiceto cleinias now or to any one else who may hereafter have to make asimilar choice among constitutions and may desire to give to hisstate some feature which is congenial to him and which he approvesin his own country 
 the first and highest form of the state and of the government and ofthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancientsaying that friends have all things in common whether there isanywhere now or will ever be this communion of women and childrenand of property in which the private and individual is altogetherbanished from life and things which are by nature private such aseyes and ears and hands have become common and in some way see andhear and act in common and all men express praise and blame andfeel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and whatever laws there areunite the city to the all this is possible or not isay that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitutea state which will be truer or better or more exalted in such a state is governed by gods or sons of gods one or morethan one happy are the men who living after this manner dwellthere and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of thestate and to cling to this and to seek with all our might for onewhich is like this the state which we have now in hand when be nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the secondplace and after that by the grace of god we will complete the thirdone and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of thesecond 
 let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses and nottill the land in common since a community of goods goes beyondtheir proposed origin and nurture and education but in making thedistribution let the several possessors feel that their particularlots also belong to the whole city and seeing that the earth is theirparent let them tend her more carefully than children do theirmother for she is a goddess and their queen and they are hermortal subjects such also are the feelings which they ought toentertain to the gods and of the country and in orderthat the distribution may always remain they ought to considerfurther that the present number of families should be always neither increased nor diminished this may be secured for thewhole city in the following the possessor of a lot leavethe one of his children who is his best beloved and one only to bethe heir of his dwelling and his successor in the duty of ministeringto the gods the state and the family as well the living members ofit as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance butof his other children if he have more than one he shall give thefemales in marriage according to the law to be hereafter the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who haveno children and are disposed to receive them or if there should benone such and particular individuals have too many children maleor female or too few as in the case of all these caseslet the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge anddetermine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient anddevise a means that the number of houses shall always remainthe same there are many ways of regulating numbers for they inwhom generation is affluent may be made to refrain and on theother hand special care may be taken to increase the number of birthsby rewards and stigmas or we may meet the evil by the elder mengiving advice and administering rebuke to the this waythe object may be attained and if after all there be very greatdifficulty about the equal preservation of the houses andthere be an excess of citizens owing to the too great love of thosewho live together and we are at our wits end there is still the olddevice often mentioned by us of sending out a colony which willpart friends with us and be composed of suitable persons if onthe other hand there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease or aplague of war and the inhabitants become much fewer than theappointed number by reason of bereavement we ought not to introducecitizens of spurious birth and education if this can be even god is said not to be able to fight against necessity 
 wherefore let us suppose this high argument of ours to addressus in the following of men cease not to honouraccording to nature similarity and equality and sameness andagreement as regards number and every good and noble quality all observe the aforesaid number throughout life in thesecond place do not disparage the small and modest proportions of theinheritances which you received in the distribution by buying andselling them to one another for then neither will the god who gaveyou the lot be your friend nor will the legislator and indeed thelaw declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which hemay or may not take the lot in the first place the earth as he isinformed is sacred to the gods and in the next place priests andpriestesses will offer up prayers over a first and second and even athird sacrifice that he who buys or sells the houses or lands whichhe has received may suffer the punishment which he deserves andthese their prayers they shall write down in the temples on tabletsof for the instruction of posterity moreover theywill set a watch over all these things that they may be which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that anyinfringement of these commands may be discovered and punished asoffences both against the law and the god how great is the benefit ofsuch an ordinance to all those cities which obey and are administeredaccordingly no bad man can ever know as the old proverb says butonly a man of experience and good habits for in such an order ofthings there will not be much opportunity for making money no maneither ought or indeed will be allowed to exercise any ignobleoccupation of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to afreeman and should never want to acquire riches by any such means 
 further the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed topossess gold and silver but only coin for daily use which isalmost necessary in dealing with artisans and for payment ofhirelings whether slaves or immigrants by all those persons whorequire the use of them wherefore our citizens as we say shouldhave a coin passing current among themselves but not accepted amongthe rest of mankind with a view however to expeditions and journeysto other embassies or for any other occasion which mayarise of sending out a herald the state must also possess a commonhellenic currency if a private person is ever obliged to go him have the consent of the magistrates and go and if when hereturns he has any foreign money remaining let him give the surplusback to the treasury and receive a corresponding sum in the localcurrency and if he is discovered to appropriate it let it beconfiscated and let him who knows and does not inform be subject tocurse and dishonour equally him who brought the money and also to afine not less in amount than the foreign money which has beenbrought back in marrying and giving in marriage no one shall give orreceive any dowry at all and no one shall deposit money withanother whom he does not trust as a friend nor shall he lend moneyupon interest and the borrower should be under no obligation to repayeither capital or interest that these principles are best any onemay see who compares them with the first principle and intention ofa state the intention as we affirm of a reasonable statesman isnot what the many declare to be the object of a good that the state for the true interests of which he isadvising should be as great and as rich as possible and shouldpossess gold and silver and have the greatest empire by sea they imagine to be the real object of legislation at thesame time adding inconsistently that the true legislator desiresto have the city the best and happiest possible but they do not seethat some of these things are possible and some of them areimpossible and he who orders the state will desire what ispossible and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts toaccomplish that which is impossible the citizen must indeed behappy and good and the legislator will seek to make him so butvery rich and very good at the same time he cannot be not atleast in the sense in which the many speak of riches for they meanby the rich the few who have the most valuable possessions althoughthe owner of them may quite well be a rogue and if this is true ican never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be be good as well as rich and good in a high degree and rich in ahigh degree at the same time he cannot be some one will ask whynot and we shall acquisitions which come fromsources which are just and unjust indifferently are more thandouble those which come from just sources only and the sums which areexpended neither honourably nor disgracefully are only half asgreat as those which are expended honourably and on honourablepurposes thus if the one acquires double and spends half theother who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly bewealthier than he the am speaking of the saver and not of not always bad he may indeed in some cases be utterly as i was saying a good man he never is for he who receivesmoney unjustly as well as justly and spends neither nor be a rich man if he be also thrifty on the other hand theutterly bad is in general profligate and therefore very poor whilehe who spends on noble objects and acquires wealth by just meansonly can hardly be remarkable for riches any more than he can bevery poor our statement then is true that the very rich are notgood and if they are not good they are not happy but the intentionof our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be and asfriendly as possible to one another and men who are always at lawwith one another and amongst whom there are many wrongs done cannever be friends to one another but only those among whom crimesand lawsuits are few and slight therefore we say that gold and silverought not to be allowed in the city nor much of the vulgar sort oftrade which is carried on by lending money or rearing the meanerkinds of live stock but only the produce of agriculture and onlyso much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect thatfor the sake of which riches mean soul and body whichwithout gymnastics and without education will never be worthanything and therefore as we have said not once but many care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts forthere are in all three things about which every man has an the interest about money when rightly regarded is the thirdand lowest of them midway comes the interest of the body of all that of the soul and the state which we aredescribing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honoursaccording to this scale but if in any of the laws which have beenordained health has been preferred to temperance or wealth to healthand temperate habits that law must clearly be wrong wherefore legislator ought often to impress upon himself do i want and do i attain my aim or do i miss themark in this way and in this way only he ma acquit himself andfree others from the work of legislation 
 let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we havementioned 
 it would be well that every man should come to the colony having allthings equal but seeing that this is not possible and one man willhave greater possessions than another for many reasons and inparticular in order to preserve equality in special crises of thestate qualifications of property must be unequal in order thatoffices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to thevalue of each wealth and not solely to the virtue of hisancestors or himself nor yet to the strength and beauty of hisperson but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty and so bya law of inequality which will be in proportion to his wealth hewill receive honours and offices as equally as possible and therewill be no quarrels and disputes to which end there should be fourdifferent standards appointed according to the amount of should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth which the citizens will be placed and they will be called by theseor similar names they may continue in the same rank or pass intoanother in any individual case on becoming richer from being poorer from being richer the form of law which i should propose asthe natural sequel would be as a state which is desirousof being saved from the greatest of all faction butrather should exist among the citizens neitherextreme poverty nor again excess of wealth for both are productiveof both these evils now the legislator should determine what is to bethe limit of poverty or wealth let the limit of poverty be thevalue of the lot this ought to be preserved and no ruler nor anyone else who aspires after a reputation for virtue will allow the lotto be impaired in any case this the legislator gives as a he will permit a man to acquire double or triple or as much asfour times the amount of this but if a person have yet greaterriches whether he has found them or they have been given to he has made them in business or has acquired by any stroke offortune that which is in excess of the measure if he give back thesurplus to the state and to the gods who are the patrons of thestate he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation but if hedisobeys this our law any one who likes may inform against him andreceive half the value of the excess and the delinquent shall pay asum equal to the excess out of his own property and the other half ofthe excess shall belong to the gods and let every possession of everyman with the exception of the lot be publicly registered beforethe magistrates whom the law appoints so that all suits about moneymay be easy and quite simple 
 the next thing to be noted is that the city should be placed asnearly as possible in the centre of the country we should choose aplace which possesses what is suitable for a city and this may easilybe imagined and described then we will divide the city into twelveportions first founding temples to hestia to zeus and to a spot which we will call the acropolis and surround with acircular wall making the division of the entire city and countryradiate from this point the twelve portions shall be equalized by theprovision that those which are of good land shall be smaller whilethose of inferior quality shall be larger the number of the lotsshall be and each of them shall be divided into two and everyallotment shall be composed of two such sections one of land near thecity the other of land which is at a distance this arrangement shallbe carried out in the following manner the section which is nearthe city shall be added to that which is on borders and form one the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portionwhich is next farthest and so of the rest moreover in the twosections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soilought to be maintained the badness and goodness shall becompensated by more and less and the legislator shall divide thecitizens into twelve parts and arrange the rest of their property asfar as possible so as to form twelve equal parts and there shallbe a registration of all after this they shall assign twelve lotsto twelve gods and call them by their names and dedicate to each godtheir several portions and call the tribes after them and they shalldistribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in whichthey divided the country and every man shall have two in the centre of the country and the other at the of the manner of settlement 
 now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such ahappy concurrence of circumstances as we have described neither canall things coincide as they are wanted men who will not takeoffence at such a mode of living together and will endure all theirlife long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit and tobeget children in accordance with our ordinances and will allowthemselves to be deprived of gold and other things which thelegislator as is evident from these enactments will certainly forbidthem and will endure further the situation of the land with thecity in the middle and dwellings round this is as if thelegislator were telling his dreams or making a city and citizens ofwax there is truth in these objections and therefore every oneshould take to heart what i am going to say once more then thelegislator shall appear and address my friends he will say tous do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree oftruth in your words but i am of opinion that in matters which arenot present but future he who exhibits a pattern of that at whichhe aims should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest andthat if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution heshould avoid and not execute it but he should contrive to carry outthat which is nearest and most akin to it you must allow thelegislator to perfect his design and when it is perfected you shouldjoin with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedientand what will arouse opposition for surely the artist who is to bedeemed worthy of any regard at all ought always to make his 
 having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelveparts let us now see in what way this may be accomplished there isno difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of thegreatest number of divisions of that which they include or inseeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them and areproduced out of them up to wherefore the law ought to orderphratries and demes and villages and also military ranks andmovements as well as coins and measures dry and liquid and as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another nor shouldwe fear the appearance of minuteness if the law commands that all thevessels which a man possesses should have a common measure when weconsider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have ause in respect of all the variations of which they are in themselves and as measures of height and depth and in allsounds and in motions as well those which proceed in a straightdirection upwards or downwards as in those which go round and legislator is to consider all these things and to bid thecitizens as far as possible not to lose sight of numerical no single instrument of youthful education has such mightypower both as regards domestic economy and politics and in the the study of arithmetic above all arithmetic stirs up him whois by nature sleepy and dull and makes him quick to learn and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond hisnatural powers all such things if only the legislator by other lawsand institutions can banish meanness and covetousness from thesouls of men so that they can use them properly and to their owngood will be excellent and suitable instruments of education butif he cannot he will unintentionally create in them instead ofwisdom the habit of craft which evil tendency may be observed in theegyptians and phoenicians and many other races through the generalvulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions whether some unworthylegislator theirs has been the cause or some impediment of chanceor nature for we must not fail to observe o megillus and there is a difference in places and that some beget better menand others worse and we must legislate accordingly some places aresubject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds andviolent heats some by reason of waters or again from the characterof the food given by the earth which not only affects the bodies ofmen for good or evil but produces similar results in their souls andin all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divineinspiration and in which the have their appointed lots andare propitious not adverse to the settlers in them to all thesematters the legislator if he have any sense in him will attend asfar as man can and frame his laws accordingly and this is whatyou cleinias must do and to matters of this kind you must turn yourmind since you are going to colonize a new country 
 cleinias your words athenian stranger are excellent and i will do as you say

 book vi 
 
 athenian stranger and now having made an end of the preliminarieswe will proceed to the appointment of magistracies 
 cleinias very good 
 ath in the ordering of a state there are two parts first thenumber of the magistracies and the mode of establishing them when they have been established laws again will have tobe provided for each of them suitable in nature and number butbefore electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word inseason about the election of them 
 cle what have you got to say 
 ath this is what i have to say every one can see that althoughthe work of legislation is a most important matter yet if city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices not onlywill there be no use in having the good only will they beridiculous and useless but the greatest political injury and evilwill accrue from them 
 cle of course 
 ath then now my friend let us observe what will happen in theconstitution of out intended state in the first place you willacknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial their families should severally have given satisfactory proofof what they are from youth upward until the time of election in thenext place those who are to elect should have been trained inhabits of law and be well educated that they may have a rightjudgment and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve ordisapprove as they are worthy of either but how can we imaginethat those who are brought together for the first time and arestrangers to one another and also uneducated will avoid makingmistakes in the choice of magistrates 
 cle impossible 
 ath the matter is serious and excuses will not serve the turn iwill tell you then what you and i will have to do since you as youtell me with nine others have offered to settle the new state onbehalf of the people of crete and i am to help you by the inventionof the present romance i certainly should not like to leave thetale wandering all over the world without a headless monsteris such a hideous thing 
 cle excellent stranger 
 ath yes and i will be as good as my word 
 cle let us by all means do as you propose 
 ath that we will by the grace of god if old age will onlypermit us 
 cle but god will be gracious 
 ath yes and under his guidance let us consider further point 
 cle what is it 
 ath let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creationthis our city is 
 cle what had you in your mind when you said that 
 ath i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we areordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws nowa man need not be very wise cleinias in order to see that no one caneasily receive laws at their first imposition but if we couldanyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from have been nurtured in them and become habituated to them taketheir part in the public elections of the state i say if thiscould be accomplished and rightly accomplished by any way i think that there would be very little danger atthe end of the time of a state thus trained not being permanent 
 cle a reasonable supposition 
 ath then let us consider if we can find any way out of thedifficulty for i maintain cleinias that the cnosians above all theother cretans should not be satisfied with barely discharging theirduty to the colony but they ought to take the utmost pains toestablish the offices which are first created by them in the bestand surest manner above all this applies to the selection of theguardians of the law who must be chosen first of all and with thegreatest care the others are of less importance 
 cle what method can we devise of electing them 
 ath this will be the of the cretans i shall say tothem inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the otherstates they should in common with those who join this a body of in all nineteen of them being takenfrom the settlers and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus ofthose latter the cnosians shall make a present to your colony and youyourself shall be one of the eighteen and shall become a citizen ofthe new state and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go thecnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you 
 cle but why stranger do not you and megillus take a part in ournew city 
 ath o cleinias athens is proud and sparta too and they are botha long way off but you and likewise the other colonists areconveniently situated as you describe i have been speaking of the wayin which the new citizens may be best managed under presentcircumstances but in if the city continues to the election be on this wise all who are horse or footsoldiers or have seen military service at the proper ages when theywere severally fitted for it shall share in the election ofmagistrates and the election shall be held in whatever temple thestate deems most venerable and every one shall carry his vote tothe altar of the god writing down on a tablet the name of theperson for whom he votes and his name and his tribe andward and at the side he shall write his own name in like one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not thinkproperly filled up and exhibit it in the agara for a period of notless than thirty days the tablets which are judged to be first tothe number of shall be shown by the magistrates to the wholecity and the citizens shall in like manner select from these thecandidates whom they prefer and this second selection to thenumber of shall be again exhibited to the citizens in the any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the walkingthrough the parts of victims and let them choose for magistratesand proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number ofvotes but who cleinias and megillus will order for us in the colonyall this matter of the magistrates and the scrutinies of them ifwe reflect we shall see that cities which are in process ofconstruction like ours must have some such persons who cannotpossibly be elected before there are any magistrates and yet theymust be elected in some way and they are not to be inferior the best possible for as the proverb says a good beginning ishalf the business and to have begun well is praised by all and inmy opinion is a great deal more than half the business and hasnever been praised by any one enough 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then let us recognize the difficulty and make clear to our ownminds how the beginning is to be accomplished there is only oneproposal which i have to offer and that is one which under ourcircumstances is both necessary and expedient 
 cle what is it 
 ath i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and are no other than the colonizing state well i know that manycolonies have been and will be at enmity with their parents butin early days the child as in a family loves and is beloved even ifthere come a time later when the tie is broken still while he isin want of education he naturally loves his parents and is beloved bythem and flies to his relatives for protection and finds in them hisonly natural allies in time of need and this parental feeling alreadyexists in the cnosians as is shown by their care of the new city andthere is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towardscnosus and i repeat what i was there is no harm inrepeating a good the cnosians should take a common interestin all these matters and choose as far as they can the eldest andbest of the colonists to the number of not less than a hundred andlet there be another hundred of the cnosians themselves these i their arrival should have a joint care that the magistrates shouldbe appointed according to law and that when they are appointed theyshould undergo a scrutiny when this has been effected the cnosiansshall return home and the new city do the best she can for her ownpreservation and happiness i would have the now andin all future time chosen to fulfil the following the first place be the guardians of the law and secondly of theregisters in which each one registers before the magistrate the amountof his property excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens ofthe first class three allowed to the second two to the third anda single mina to the fourth and if any one despising the laws forthe sake of gain be found to possess anything more which has not beenregistered let all that he has in excess be confiscated and lethim be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable orfortunate and let any one who will indict him on the charge ofloving base gains and proceed against him before the guardians of thelaw and if he be cast let him lose his share of the publicpossessions and when there is any public distribution let him havenothing but his original lot and let him be written down acondemned man as long as he lives in some place in which any onewho pleases can read about his onces the guardian of the law shallnot hold office longer than twenty years and shall not be less thanfifty years of age when he is elected or if he is elected when heis sixty years of age he shall hold office for ten years only andupon the same principle he must not imagine that he will be permittedto hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws afterhe is seventy years of age if he live so long 
 these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the the work of legislation progresses each law in turn will assign tothem their further duties and now we may proceed in order to speak ofthe election of other officers for generals have to be elected andthese again must have their ministers commanders and colonels ofhorse and commanders of brigades of foot who would be more rightlycalled by their popular name of brigadiers the guardians of the lawshall propose as generals men who are natives of the city and aselection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those whoare or have been of the age for military service and if one who isnot proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who him name whom he prefers in the place of whom and make oaththat he is better and propose him and whichever of them isapproved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection and thethree who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointedgenerals and superintendents of military affairs after previouslyundergoing a scrutiny like the guardians of the law and let thegenerals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers one for each there shall be a right of counterproposal as in the case of thegenerals and the voting and decision shall take place in the sameway until the prytanes and council are elected the guardians ofthe law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitableto the purpose placing the hoplites by themselves and the cavalry bythemselves and in a third division all the rest of the army allare to vote for the generals and for the colonels of horse butthe brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry the hoplites let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs forthe generals but captains of light troops or archers or any otherdivision of the army shall be appointed by the generals forthemselves there only remains the appointment of officers of shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the the election and the of other candidates shall bearranged in the same way as in the case of the generals and let thecavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election the two whohave the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all thehorse disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice but ifthe dispute be raised a third time the officers who preside at theseveral elections shall decide 
 the council shall consist of x members will be aconvenient number for if we divide the whole number intofour parts of ninety each we get ninety counsellors for each all the citizens shall select candidates from the firstclass they shall be compelled to vote and if they do not shallbe duly fined when the candidates have been selected some oneshall mark them down this shall be the business of the first day andon the following day candidates shall be selected from the secondclass in the same manner and under the same conditions as on theprevious day and on the third day a selection shall be made fromthe third class at which every one may if he likes vote and thethree first classes shall be compelled to vote but the fourth andlowest class shall be under no compulsion and any member of thisclass who does not vote shall not be punished on the fourth daycandidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest shall be selected by all but he who is of the fourth class shallsuffer no penalty nor he who is of the third if he be not willing tovote but he who is of the first or second class if he does notvote shall be who is of the second class shall pay a fineof triple the amount which was exacted at first and he who is ofthe first class quadruple on the fifth day the rulers shall bring outthe names noted down for all the citizens to see and every man shallchoose out of them under pain if he do not of suffering the firstpenalty and when they have chosen out of each of the classes theyshall choose of them by lot who shall undergo are to form the council for the year 
 the mode of election which has been described is in a mean betweenmonarchy and democracy and such a mean the state ought always toobserve for servants and masters never can be friends nor good andbad merely because they are declared to have equal privileges for tounequals equals become unequal if they are not harmonized by both by reason of equality and by reason of inequality citiesare filled with seditions the old saying that equality makesfriendship is happy and also true but there is obscurity andconfusion as to what sort of equality is meant for there are twoequalities which are called by the same name but are in reality inmany ways almost the opposite of one another one of them may beintroduced without difficulty by any state or any legislator in thedistribution of honours this is the rule of measure weight andnumber which regulates and apportions them but there is anotherequality of a better and higher kind which is not so easilyrecognized this is the judgment of zeus among men it avails butlittle that little however is the source of the greatest good toindividuals and states for it gives to the greater more and to theinferior less and in proportion to the nature of each and above honour always to the greater virtue and to the less less andto either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue andeducation and this is justice and is ever the true principle ofstates at which we ought to aim and according to this rule order thenew city which is now being founded and any other city which may behereafter founded to this the legislator should to theinterests of tyrants one or more or to the power of the people butto justice always which as i was saying the distribution of naturalequality among unequals in each case but there are times at whichevery state is compelled to use the words just equal in asecondary sense in the hope of escaping in some degree from equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strictrule of justice and this is the reason why we are obliged to usethe equality of the lot in order to avoid the discontent of thepeople and so we invoke god and fortune in our prayers and begthat they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supremejustice and therefore although we are compelled to use bothequalities we should use that into which the element of chance entersas seldom as possible 
 thus o my friends and for the reasons given should a state actwhich would endure and be saved but as a ship sailing on the seahas to be watched night and day in like manner a city also is sailingon a sea of politics and is liable to all sorts of insidiousassaults and therefore from morning to night and from night tomorning rulers must join hands with rulers and watchers withwatchers receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetualsuccession now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sortwith anything like energy moreover the greater number of thesenators will have to be left during the greater part of the year toorder their concerns at their own homes they will therefore have tobe arranged in twelve portions answering to the twelve months andfurnish guardians of the state each portion for a single month theirbusiness is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen whocomes to them whether to give information or to put one of thosequestions to which when asked by other cities a city should give ananswer and to which if she ask them herself she should receive ananswer or again when there is a likelihood of internal are always liable to happen in some form or other they will ifthey can prevent their occurring or if they have already lose time in making them known to the city and healing the also this which is the presiding body of the state oughtalways to have the control of their assemblies and of thedissolutions of them ordinary as well as extraordinary all this isto be ordered by the twelfth part of the council which is always tokeep watch together with the other officers of the state during oneportion of the year and to rest during the remaining eleven portions 
 thus will the city be fairly ordered and now who is to have thesuperintendence of the country and what shall be the that the whole city and the entire country have been both ofthem divided into twelve portions ought there not to be appointedsuperintendents of the streets of the city and of the houses andbuildings and harbours and the agora and fountains and sacreddomains and temples and the like 
 cle to be sure there ought

 after the wardens of the country we have to speak of the electionof wardens of the agora and of the city the wardens of the countrywere sixty in number and the wardens of the city will be three andwill divide the twelve parts of the city into three like theformer they shall have care of the ways and of the different highroads which lead out of the country into the city and of thebuildings that they may be all made according to of thewaters which the guardians of the supply preserve and convey to being taken that they may reach the fountains pure andabundant and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city thesealso should be men of influence and at leisure to take care of thepublic interest let every man propose as warden of the city any onewhom he likes out of the highest class and when the vote has beengiven on them and the number is reduced to the six who have thegreatest number of votes let the electing officers choose by lotthree out of the six and when they have undergone a scrutiny let themhold office according to the laws laid down for them next let thewardens of the agora be elected in like manner out of the first andsecond class five in number ten are to be first elected and outof the ten five are to be chosen by lot as in the election of thewardens of the when they have undergone a scrutiny areto be declared magistrates every one shall vote for every one and hewho will not vote if he be informed against before the be fined fifty drachmae and shall also be deemed a bad any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and secondclass and they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be foundnot answering to their names at the assembly the third and fourthclass shall be under no compulsion and shall be let off without afine unless the magistrates have commanded all to be present inconsequence of some urgent necessity the wardens of the agora shallobserve the order appointed by law for the agora and shall have thecharge of the temples and fountains which are in the agora and theyshall see that no one injures anything and punish him who stripes and bonds if he be a slave or stranger but if he be acitizen who misbehaves in this way they shall have the powerthemselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundreddrachmae or with the consent of the wardens of the city up todouble that amount and let the wardens of the city have a similarpower of imposing punishments and fines in their own department andlet them impose fines by their own department and let them imposefines by their own authority up to a mina or up to two minae withthe consent of the wardens of the agora 
 in the next place it will be proper to appoint directors of musicand gymnastic two kinds of the one kind the business willbe education of the other the superintendence of contests inspeaking of education the law means to speak of those who have thecare of order and instruction in gymnasia and schools and of thegoing to school and of school buildings for boys and girls and inspeaking of contests the law refers to the judges of gymnastics andof music these again are divided into two classes the one havingto do with music the other with gymnastics and the same who judge ofthe gymnastic contests of men shall judge of horses but in musicthere shall be one set of judges of solo singing and of of rhapsodists players on the harp the flute and the another who shall judge of choral song first of all we mustchoose directors for the choruses of boys and men and they shall follow in the amusement of the dance and for ourother musical arrangements one director will be enough for thechoruses and he should be not less than forty years of age onedirector will also be enough to introduce the solo singers and togive judgment on the competitors and he ought not to be less thanthirty years of age the director and manager of the choruses shall beelected after the following any persons who commonlytake an interest in such matters go to the meeting and be fined ifthey do not go the guardians of the law shall judge of theirfault but those who have no interest shall not be compelled theelector shall propose as director some one who understands he in the scrutiny may be challenged on the one part by thosewho say he has no skill and defended on the other hand by those whosay that he has ten are to be elected by vote and he of the tenwho is chosen by lot shall undergo a scrutiny and lead the chorusesfor a year according to law and in like manner the competitor whowins the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for thatyear and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award to thejudges in the next place we have to choose judges in the contests ofhorses and of men these shall be selected from the third and alsofrom the second class of citizens and three first classes shall becompelled to go to the election but the lowest may stay away withimpunity and let there be three elected by lot out of the twentywho have been chosen previously and they must also have the voteand approval of the examiners but if any one is rejected in thescrutiny at any ballot or decision others shall be chosen in the samemanner and undergo a similar scrutiny 
 there remains the minister of the education of youth male andfemale he too will rule according to law one such minister will besufficient and he must be fifty years old and have children lawfullybegotten both boys and girls by preference at any rate one or theother he who is elected and he who is the elector should considerthat of all the great offices of state this is the greatest forthe first shoot of any plant if it makes a good start towards theattainment of its natural excellence has the greatest effect on itsmaturity and this is not only true of plants but of animals wild andtame and also of men man as we say is a tame or civilizedanimal nevertheless he requires proper instruction and a fortunatenature and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and mostcivilized but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is themost savage of earthly creatures wherefore the legislator ought notto allow the education of children to become a secondary or accidentalmatter in the first place he who would be rightly provident aboutthem should begin by taking care that he is elected who of all thecitizens is in every way best him the legislator shall do hisutmost to appoint guardian and superintendent to this end all themagistrates with the exception of the council and prytanes shallgo to the temple of apollo and elect by ballot him of the guardiansof the law whom they severally think will be the best superintendentof education and he who has the greatest number of votes after hehas undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates whohave been his electors with the exception of the guardians of hold office for five years and in the sixth year letanother be chosen in like manner to fill his office 
 if any one dies while he is holding a public office and more thanthirty days before his term of office expires let those whosebusiness it is elect another to the office in the same manner asbefore and if any one who is entrusted with orphans dies let therelations both on the and side who are residingat home including cousins appoint another guardian within tendays or be fined a drachma a day for neglect to do so 
 a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city andagain if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminaryproceedings than the litigants as is the case in arbitrations hewill never be able to decide justly wherefore a multitude of judgeswill not easily judge well nor a few if they are bad the point indispute between the parties should be made clear and time anddeliberation and repeated examination greatly tend to clear updoubts for this reason he who goes to law with another should gofirst of all to his neighbours and friends who know best the questionsat issue and if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactorydecision let him have recourse to another court and if the twocourts cannot settle the matter let a third put an end to the suit 
 now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as achoice of magistrates for every magistrate must also be a judge ofsome things and the judge though he be not a magistrate yet incertain respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which heis determining a suit regarding then the judges also asmagistrates let us say who are fit to be judges and of what they areto be judges and how many of them are to judge in each suit let thatbe the supreme tribunal which the litigants appoint in common forthemselves choosing certain persons by agreement and let there betwo other tribunals one for private causes when a citizen accusesanother of wronging him and wishes to get a decision the other forpublic causes in which some citizen is of opinion that the public hasbeen wronged by an individual and is willing to vindicate thecommon interests and we must not forget to mention how the judges areto be qualified and who they are to be in the first place let therebe a tribunal open to all private persons who are trying causes oneagainst another for the third time and let this be composed the officers of state as well annual as those holdingoffice for a longer period when the new year is about to commence inthe month following after the summer solstice on the last day but oneof the year shall meet in some temple and calling god to dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be choosing in each office him who seems to them to bethe best and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of during the ensuing year in the best and holiestmanner and when the election is completed a scrutiny shall be heldin the presence of the electors themselves and if any one be rejectedanother shall be chosen in the same manner those who have undergonethe scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined theinferior courts and shall give their vote openly the councillors andother magistrates who have elected them shall be required to behearers and spectators of the causes and any one else may bepresent who pleases if one man charges another with havingintentionally decided wrong let him go to the guardians of the lawand lay his accusation before them and he who is found guilty in sucha case shall pay damages to the injured party equal to half theinjury but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty thejudges shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer andhow much more he ought to pay to the public treasury and to the partywho brought the suit 
 in the judgment of offences against the state the people ought toparticipate for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged andmay reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in thedecision such causes ought to originate with the people and theought also to have the final decision of them but the trial of themshall take place before three of the highest magistrates upon whomthe plaintiff and the defendant shall agree and if they are notable to come to an agreement themselves the council shall chooseone of the two proposed and in private suits too as far as ispossible all should have a share for he who has no share in theadministration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share inthe state at all and for this reason there shall be a court of law inevery tribe and the judges shall be chosen by shall givetheir decisions at once and shall be inaccessible to final judgment shall rest with that court which as we been established in the most incorruptible form of which humanthings admit this shall be the court established for those who areunable to get rid of their suits either in the courts of neighbours orof the tribes 
 thus much of the courts of law which as i was saying cannot beprecisely defined either as being or not being offices asuperficial sketch has been given of them in which some things havebeen told and others omitted for the right place of an exactstatement of the laws respecting suits under their several be at the end of the body of us then expect themat the end hitherto our legislation has been chiefly occupied withthe appointment of offices perfect unity and exactness extendingto the whole and every particular of political be attained to the full until the discussion shall have abeginning middle and end and is complete in every part atpresent we have reached the election of magistrates and this may beregarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded and now thereneed no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work oflegislation 
 cle i like what you have said i particularly likeyour manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to theend of the former one 
 ath thus far then the old rational pastime has gone offwell 
 cle you mean i suppose their serious and noble pursuit 
 ath perhaps but i should like to know whether you and i are agreedabout a certain thing 
 cle about what thing 
 ath you know the endless labour which painters expend upon are always putting in or taking out colours or whateverbe the term which artists employ they seem as if they would nevercease touching up their works which are always being made brighterand more beautiful 
 cle i know something of these matters from report although ihave never had any great acquaintance with the art 
 ath no matter we may make use of the that some one had a mind to paint a figure inthe most beautiful manner in the hope that his work instead of losingwould always improve as time went you not see that being amortal unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correctthe flaws which time may introduce and be able to add what is leftimperfect through the defect of the artist and who will furtherbrighten up and improve the picture all his great labour will lastbut a short time 
 cle true 
 ath and is not the aim of the legislator similar first he desiresthat his laws should be written down with all possible exactness inthe second place as time goes on and he has made an actual trial ofhis decrees will he not find omissions do you imagine that thereever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things arenecessarily omitted which some one coming after him must the constitution and the order of government is not to to improve in the state which he has established 
 cle assuredly that is the sort of thing which every one woulddesire 
 ath and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this byword or deed or has any way great or small by which he can teach aperson to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws he shouldfinish what he has to say and not leave the work incomplete 
 cle by all means 
 ath and is not this what you and i have to do at the presentmoment 
 cle what have we to do 
 ath as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians ofthe law and are ourselves in the evening of life and they ascompared with us are young men we ought not only to legislate forthem but to endeavour to make them not only guardians of the lawbut legislators themselves as far as this is possible 
 cle certainly if we can 
 ath at any rate we must do our best 
 cle of course 
 ath we will say to friends and saviours of our laws inlaying down any law there are many particulars which we shall this cannot be helped at the same time we will do our utmostto describe what is important and will give an outline which youshall fill up and i will explain on what principle you are to and cleinias and i have often spoken to one anothertouching these matters and we are of opinion that we have spokenwell and we hope that you will be of the same mind with us andbecome our disciples and keep in view the things which in ourunited opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep inview there was one main point about which we were a energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition ofthe virtue proper to a man whether this was to be gained by study orhabit or some mode of acquisition or desire or opinion this applies equally to men and women old and of all should always be such as i have described anything whichmay be an impediment the good man ought to show that he utterlydisregards and if at last necessity plainly compels him to be anoutlaw from his native land rather than bow his neck to the yoke ofslavery and be ruled by inferiors and he has to fly an exile he mustbe and endure all such trials rather than accept another form ofgovernment which is likely to make men worse these are ouroriginal principles and do you now fixing your eyes upon thestandard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to and blame the those which have not this power ofmaking the citizen better but embrace those which have and withgladness receive and live in them bidding a long farewell to otherinstitutions which aim at goods as they are termed of a differentkind 
 let us proceed to another class of laws beginning with theirfoundation in religion and we must first return to the entire number had and has a great many convenientdivisions and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part ofthe whole being correctly formed by x x also has them and not only is the whole numberdivisible by twelve but also the number of each tribe is divisible bytwelve now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift ofheaven corresponding to the months and to the revolution of theuniverse every city has a guiding and sacred principle given bynature but in some the division or distribution has been more rightthan in others and has been more sacred and fortunate in ouropinion nothing can be more right than the selection of the number which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve withthe single exception of eleven and that admits of a very easycorrection for if turning to the dividend we deduct twofamilies the defect in the division is cured and the truth of thismay be easily proved when we have leisure but for the to the mere assertion of this principle let us divide thestate and assigning to each portion some god or son of a god letus give them altars and sacred rites and at the altars let us holdassemblies for sacrifice twice in the assemblies forthe tribes and twelve for the city according to their divisions thefirst in honour of the gods and divine things and the second topromote friendship and better acquaintance as the phrase is andevery sort of good fellowship with one another for people must beacquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and withthose to whom they give in marriage in such matters as far aspossible a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake andwith this serious purpose let games be instituted in which youthsand maidens shall dance together seeing one another and being seennaked at a proper age and on a suitable occasion nottransgressing the rules of modesty 
 the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulatorsof these games and they together with the guardians of the law willlegislate in any matters which we have omitted for as we said wherethere are numerous and minute details the legislator must leave outsomething and the annual officers who have experience and knowwhat is wanted must make arrangements and improvements year byyear until such enactments and provisions are sufficientlydetermined a ten years experience of sacrifices and dances ifextending to all particulars will be quite sufficient and if thelegislator be alive they shall communicate with him but if he be deadthen the several officers shall refer the omissions which come undertheir notice to the guardians of the law and correct them untilall is perfect and from that time there shall be no more they shall establish and use the new laws with the others whichthe legislator originally gave them and of which they are never ifthey can help to change aught or if some necessity overtakesthem the magistrates must be called into counsel and the wholepeople and they must go to all the oracles of the gods and if theyare all agreed in that case they may make the change but if they arenot agreed by no manner of means and any one who dissents shallprevail as the law ordains 
 whenever any one over years of age having seen and beenseen by others believes himself to have found a marriage connectionwhich is to his mind and suitable for the procreation of him marry if he be still under the age of let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable andappropriate for as cleinias says every law should have a suitableprelude 
 cle you recollect at the right moment stranger and do not missthe opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season 
 ath i thank you we will say to him who is born of good son you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage norspecially to desire a rich one but if other things are to honour inferiors and with them to form be for the benefit of the city and of the families which areunited for the equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more tovirtue than the unmixed and he who is conscious of being tooheadstrong and carried away more than is fitting in all hisactions ought to desire to become the relation of orderly he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the oppositealliance let there be one word concerning all manshall follow not after the marriage which is most pleasing tohimself but after that which is most beneficial to the state forsomehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest tohimself and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in propertyand in disposition and hence there arise in most states the veryresults which we least desire to happen now to add to the law anexpress provision not only that the rich man shall not marry into therich family nor the powerful into the family of the powerful butthat the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage withthe quicker and the quicker with the slower may awaken anger as wellas laughter in the minds of many for there is a difficulty inperceiving that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup in whichthe maddening wine is hot and fiery but when chastened by a soberergod receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent andtemperate drink yet in marriage no one is able to see that the sameresult occurs wherefore also the law must let alone such matters butwe should try to charm the spirits of men into believing theequability of their disposition to be of more importancethan equality in excessive fortune when they marry and him who is toodesirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn asideby reproaches not however by any compulsion of written law 
 let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage and let usremember what was said a man should cling toimmortality and leave behind him children to be theservants of god in his place for ever all this and much more may betruly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage but if aman will not listen and remains unsocial and alien among and is still unmarried at years of him pay a yearly who of the highest class shall pay afine of a hundred drachmae and he who is of the second dass a fine ofseventy drachmae the third class shall pay sixty drachmae and thefourth thirty drachmae and let the money be sacred to here he whodoes not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum whichthe treasurer of the goddess shall exact and if he fails in doing him be answerable and give an account of the money at hisaudit he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money andalso be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the no young man voluntarily obey him and if he attempt to punish anyone let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured he who is present and does not come to the rescue shall bepronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen of themarriage portion i have already spoken and again i say for theinstruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowryon account of poverty has a compensation for the citizens of ourstate are provided with the necessaries of life and wives will beless likely to be insolent and husbands to be mean and subservient tothem on account of property and he who obeys this law will do a nobleaction but he who will not obey and gives or receives more thanfifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of thelowest or more than a mina or a mina if he be of thethird or second classes or two minae if he be of the highest owe to the public treasury a similar sum and that which isgiven or received shall be sacred to here and zeus and let thetreasurers of these gods exact the money as was said before about the treasurers of here were to exact the money orpay the fine themselves 
 the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree thatby a grandfather in the second degree and in the third by brothers who have the same father but if there arenone of these alive the betrothal by a mother shall be valid inlike manner in cases of unexampled fatality the next of kin andthe guardians shall have authority what are to be the rites beforemarriages or any other sacred acts relating either to or past marriages shall be referred to the interpreters andhe who follows their advice may be satisfied touching the marriagefestival they shall assemble not more than five male and fivefemale friends of both families and a like number of members of thefamily of either sex and no man shall spend more than his meanswill allow he who is of the richest class may spend a whois of the second half a mina and in the same proportion as thecensus of each decreases all men shall praise him who is obedientto the law but he who is disobedient shall be punished by theguardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste anduninstructed in the laws of bridal song drunkenness is alwaysimproper except at the festivals of the god who gave wine andpeculiarly dangerous when a man is engaged in the business ofmarriage at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom oughtto have all their wits about ought to take care that theiroffspring may be born of reasonable beings for on what day or nightheaven will give them increase who can say moreover they oughtnot to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated byintoxication but their offspring should be compact and solid quietand compounded properly whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all hisactions and beside himself both in body and soul wherefore drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable anduntrustworthy and cannot be expected to walk straight either inbody or mind hence during the whole year and all his life long andespecially while he is begetting children ought to take care andnot intentionally do what is injurious to health or what involvesinsolence and wrong for he cannot help leaving the impression ofhimself on the souls and bodies of his offspring and he begetschildren in every way inferior and especially on the day and night ofmarriage should a man abstain from such things for the is also a god dwelling in man preserves all things if itmeet with proper respect from each individual he who marries isfurther to consider that one of the two houses in the lot is thenest and nursery of his young and there he is to marry and make ahome for himself and bring up his children going away from his fatherand mother for in friendships there must be some degree of desire inorder to cement and bind together diversities of character butexcessive intercourse not having the desire which is created bytime insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father andmother their own and themselves go as to a colony anddwell there and visit and be visited by their parents and they shallbeget and bring up children handing on the torch of life from onegeneration to another and worshipping the gods according to law forever 
 in the next place we have to consider what sort of property will bemost convenient there is no difficulty either in understanding oracquiring most kinds of property but there is great difficulty inwhat relates to slaves and the reason is that we speak about themin a way which is right and which is not right for what we sayabout our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent with our practiceabout them 
 megillus i do not understand stranger what you mean 
 ath i am not surprised megillus for the state of the helots amongthe lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the mostcontroverted and disputed about some approving and some condemningit there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among theheracleots who have subjugated the mariandynians and about thethessalian penestae looking at these and the like examples whatought we to do concerning property in slaves i made a remark inpassing which naturally elicited a question about my meaning fromyou it was know that all would agree that we should have thebest and most attached slaves whom we can get for many a man hasfound his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons and manytimes they have saved the lives and property of their masters andtheir whole tales are well known 
 meg to be sure 
 ath but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterlycorrupt and that no man of sense ought to trust them and thewisest of our poets speaking of zeus says 
 zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom theday of slavery persons have got these two different notions of slaves intheir of them utterly distrust their servants and as ifthey were wild beasts chastise them with goads and whips and maketheir souls three times or rather many times as slavish as they others do just the opposite 
 meg true 
 cle then what are we to do in our own country stranger seeingthat there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by theirowners 
 ath well cleinias there can be no doubt that man is a troublesomeanimal and therefore he is not very manageable nor likely tobecome so when you attempt to introduce the necessary and freeman and master 
 cle that is obvious 
 ath he is a troublesome piece of goods as has been often shownby the frequent revolts of the messenians and the great mischiefswhich happen in states having many slaves who speak the same the numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian they are called a man who considers all this is fairly at aloss two remedies alone remain to to have the slaves of thesame country nor if possible speaking the same language in this waythey will more easily be held in subjection secondly we shouldtend them carefully not only out of regard to them but yet moreout of respect to ourselves and the right treatment of slaves is tobehave properly to them and to do to them if possible even morejustice than to those who are our equals for he who naturally andgenuinely reverences justice and hates injustice is discovered inhis dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves isundefiled by impiety and injustice will best sow the seeds ofvirtue in them and this may be truly said of every master andtyrant and of every other having authority in relation to hisinferiors slaves ought to be punished as they deserve and notadmonished as if they were freemen which will only make themconceited the language used to a servant ought always to be that of acommand and we ought not to jest with them whether they are males is a foolish way which many people have of setting uptheir slaves and making the life of servitude more disagreeableboth for them and for their masters 
 cle true 
 ath now that each of the citizens is provided as far aspossible with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help himin what he has to do we may next proceed to describe their dwellings 
 cle very good 
 ath the city being new and hitherto uninhabited care ought to betaken of all the buildings and the manner of building each of also of the temples and walls these cleinias were matters whichproperly came before the marriages but as we are only talking thereis no objection to changing the order if however our plan oflegislation is ever to take effect then the house shall precede themarriage if god so will and afterwards we will come to theregulations about marriage but at present we are only describingthese matters in a general outline 
 cle quite true 
 ath the temples are to be placed all round the agora and the wholecity built on the heights in a circle for the sake of defence and forthe sake of purity near the temples are to be placed buildings forthe magistrates and the courts of law in these plaintiff anddefendant will receive their due and the places will be regarded asmost holy partly because they have to do with the holy things andpartly because they are the of holy gods and inthem will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and othertrials of capital offenses may fitly take place as to the i agree with sparta in thinking that they should beallowed to sleep in the earth and that we should not attempt todisinter them there is a poetical saying which is finelyexpressed that walls ought to be of steel and iron and not ofearth besides how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young menannually into the country to dig and to trench and to keep off theenemy by fortifications under the idea that they are not to beallowed to set foot in our territory and then that we shouldsurround ourselves with a wall which in the first place is by nomeans conducive to the health of cities and is also apt to producea certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants inviting mento run thither instead of repelling their enemies and leading them toimagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day andnight but that when they are protected by walls and gates thenthey may sleep in safety as if they were not meant to labour and didnot know that true repose comes from labour and that disgracefulindolence and a careless temper of mind is only the renewal oftrouble but if men must have walls the private houses ought to be soarranged from the first that the whole city may be one wall havingall the houses capable of defence by reason of their uniformity andequality towards the streets the form of the city being that of asingle dwelling will have an agreeable aspect and being easilyguarded will be infinitely better for security until the originalbuilding is completed these should be the principal objects of theinhabitants and the wardens of the city should superintend thework and should impose a fine on him who is negligent and in allthat relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness andnot allow a private person to encroach upon any public property eitherby buildings or excavations further they ought to take care that therains from heaven flow off easily and of any other matters whichmay have to be administered either within or without the city theguardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which theirexperience may show to be necessary and supply any other points inwhich the law may be deficient and now that these matters and thebuildings about the agora and the gymnasia and places ofinstruction and theatres are all ready and waiting for scholarsand spectators let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriagein the order of legislation 
 cle by all means 
 ath assuming that marriages exist already cleinias the mode oflife during the year after marriage before children are born willfollow next in order in what way bride and bridegroom ought to livein a city which is to be superior to other cities is a matter notat all easy for us to determine there have been many difficultiesalready but this will be the greatest of them and the mostdisagreeable to the many still i cannot but say what appears to me tobe right and true cleinias 
 cle certainly 
 ath he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct ofstates while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to takecare of itself who thinks that individuals may pass the day as theyplease and that there is no necessity of order in all things he isay who gives up the control of their private lives and supposesthat they will conform to law in their common and public life ismaking a great mistake why have i made this remark why because i amgoing to enact that the bridegrooms should live at the commontables just as they did before marriage this was a singularitywhen first enacted by the legislator in your parts of the and cleinias as i should suppose on the occasion of somewar or other similar danger which caused the passing of the which would be likely to occur in places and intimes of pressure but when men had once tried and been accustomedto a common table experience showed that the institution greatlyconduced to security and in some such manner the custom of havingcommon tables arose among you 
 cle likely enough 
 ath i said that there may have been singularity and danger inimposing such a custom at first but that now there is not the samedifficulty there is however another institution which is thenatural sequel to this and would be excellent if it existedanywhere but at present it does not the institution of which i amabout to speak is not easily described or executed and would belike the legislator combing wool into the fire as people say orperforming any other impossible and useless feat 
 cle what is the cause stranger of this extreme hesitation 
 ath you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time that whichhas law and order in a state is the cause of every good but thatwhich is disordered or is often the ruin of that whichis and at this point the argument is now waiting forwith you cleinias and megillus the common tables of men are as isaid a and admirable institution but you are mistaken inleaving the women unregulated by law they have no similar institutionof public tables in the light of day and just that part of thehuman race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth onaccount of their mean the female been leftwithout regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake consequence of this neglect many things have grown lax amongyou which might have been far better if they had been only regulatedby law for the neglect of regulations about women may not only beregarded as a neglect of half the entire matter but in proportionas nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for that degree the consequence of such neglect is more than twice asimportant the careful consideration of this matter and the arrangingand ordering on a common principle of all our institutions relatingboth to men and women greatly conduces to the happiness of the at present such is the unfortunate condition of mankind thatno man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables inplaces and cities in which they have never been established at how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous who attempts tocompel women to show in public how much they eat and drink there isnothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence for women areaccustomed to creep into dark places and when dragged out into thelight they will exert their utmost powers of resistance and be fartoo much for the legislator and therefore as i said before inmost places they will not endure to have the truth spoken withoutraising a tremendous outcry but in this state perhaps they may andif we may assume that our whole discussion about the state has notbeen mere idle talk i should like to prove to you if you willconsent to listen that this institution is good and proper but ifyou had rather not i will refrain 
 cle there is nothing which we should both of us like than to hear what you have to say 
 ath very good and you must not be surprised if i go back a we have plenty of leisure and there is nothing to prevent us fromconsidering in every point of view the subject of law 
 cle true 
 ath then let us return once more to what we were saying at man should understand that the human race either had nobeginning at all and will never have an end but always will be andhas been or that it began an immense while ago 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and have there not been constitutions and destructions ofstates and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly anddiverse desires of meats and drinks always and in all the all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may beexpected to have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and may we not suppose that vines appeared which hadpreviously no existence and also olives and the gifts of demeter andher daughter of which one triptolemus was the minister and these existed animals took to devouring each other as theydo still 
 cle true 
 ath again the practice of men sacrificing one another still existsamong many nations while on the other hand we hear of other humanbeings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and had noanimal sacrifices but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey andsimilar pure offerings but no flesh of animals from these theyabstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them and mightnot stain the altars of the gods with blood for in those days men aresaid to have lived a sort of orphic life having the use of alllifeless things but abstaining from all living things 
 cle such has been the constant tradition and is very likely true 
 ath some one might say to us what is the drift of all this 
 cle a very pertinent question stranger 
 ath and therefore i will endeavour cleinias if i can to draw thenatural inference 
 cle proceed 
 ath i see that among men all things depend upon three wants anddesires of which the end is virtue if they are rightly led bythem or the opposite if wrongly now these are eating and begin at animal has a natural desire for them andis violently excited and rebels against him who says that he must notsatisfy all his pleasures and appetites and get rid of all thecorresponding the third and greatest and sharpest want anddesire breaks out last and is the fire of sexual lust whichkindles in men every species of wantonness and madness and thesethree disorders we must endeavour to master by the three greatprinciples of fear and law and right reason turning them away fromthat which is called pleasantest to the best using the muses andthe gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase andinflux 
 but to marriage let us speak of the birth of after their birth of their nurture and education in the course ofdiscussion the several laws will be perfected and we shall at lastarrive at the common tables whether such associations are to beconfined to men or extended to women also we shall see better whenwe approach and take a nearer view of them and we may thendetermine what previous institutions are required and will have toprecede them as i said before we shall see them more in detail andshall be better able to lay down the laws which are proper or suitedto them 
 cle very true 
 ath let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken forhereafter there may be need of them 
 cle what do you bid us keep in mind 
 ath that which we comprehended under the three drinking thirdly the excitement of love 
 cle we shall be sure to remember stranger 
 ath very good then let us now proceed to marriage and teachpersons in what way they shall beget children threatening them ifthey disobey with the terrors of the law 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are toproduce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children whichthey can now all men who are associated any action always succeedwhen they attend and give their mind to what they are doing butwhen they do not give their mind or have no mind they fail whereforelet the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begettingof children and the bride in like manner give her mind to thebridegroom and particularly at the time when their children are notyet born and let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers ofsuch matters and let them in whatever number large or small andat whatever time the magistrates may command assemble every day inthe temple of eileithyia during a third part of the day and beingthere assembled let them inform one another of any one whom they man or woman of those who are begetting the ordinances given at the time when the nuptialsacrifices and ceremonies were performed let the begetting ofchildren and the supervision of those who are begetting themcontinue ten years and no longer during the time when marriage isfruitful but if any continue without children up to this time letthem take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding theoffice of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit any dispute arises about what is proper and for theinterest of either party they shall choose ten of the guardians ofthe law and abide by their permission and appointment the women whopreside over these matters shall enter into the houses of the partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give overtheir folly and error if they persist let the women go and tellthe guardians of the law and the guardians shall prevent them but ifthey too cannot prevent them they shall bring the matter before thepeople and let them write up their names and make oath that theycannot reform such and such an one and let him who is thus writtenup if he cannot in a court of law convict those who have inscribedhis name be deprived of the privileges of a citizen in thefollowing him not go to weddings nor to thethanksgivings after the birth of children and if he go let any onewho pleases strike him with impunity and let the same regulationshold about women let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad orreceive honour or go to nuptial and birthday festivals if she inlike manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain averdict and if when they themselves have done begetting childrenaccording to the law a man or woman have connection with anotherman or woman who are still begetting children let the samepenalties be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still havinga family and when the time for procreation has passed let the manor woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem and let thosewho do not refrain be held in the contrary of is to now if the greater part of mankind behave modestly theenactments of law may be left to slumber but if they are enactments having been passed let them be carried into every man the first year is the beginning of life and the timeof birth ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers asthe beginning of existence to every child whether boy or girl letevery phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names of thesuccessive archons by whom the years are reckoned and near to themlet the living members of the phratria be inscribed and when theydepart life let them be erased the limit of marriageable ages for awoman shall be from sixteen to twenty years at the aman from thirty to years and let a woman hold officeat forty and a man at thirty years let a man go out to war fromtwenty to sixty years and for a woman if there appear any need tomake use of her in military service let the time of service beafter she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years ofage and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each

 book vi 
 
 athenian stranger and now having made an end of the preliminarieswe will proceed to the appointment of magistracies 
 cleinias very good 
 ath in the ordering of a state there are two parts first thenumber of the magistracies and the mode of establishing them when they have been established laws again will have tobe provided for each of them suitable in nature and number butbefore electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word inseason about the election of them 
 cle what have you got to say 
 ath this is what i have to say every one can see that althoughthe work of legislation is a most important matter yet if city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices not onlywill there be no use in having the good only will they beridiculous and useless but the greatest political injury and evilwill accrue from them 
 cle of course 
 ath then now my friend let us observe what will happen in theconstitution of out intended state in the first place you willacknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial their families should severally have given satisfactory proofof what they are from youth upward until the time of election in thenext place those who are to elect should have been trained inhabits of law and be well educated that they may have a rightjudgment and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve ordisapprove as they are worthy of either but how can we imaginethat those who are brought together for the first time and arestrangers to one another and also uneducated will avoid makingmistakes in the choice of magistrates 
 cle impossible 
 ath the matter is serious and excuses will not serve the turn iwill tell you then what you and i will have to do since you as youtell me with nine others have offered to settle the new state onbehalf of the people of crete and i am to help you by the inventionof the present romance i certainly should not like to leave thetale wandering all over the world without a headless monsteris such a hideous thing 
 cle excellent stranger 
 ath yes and i will be as good as my word 
 cle let us by all means do as you propose 
 ath that we will by the grace of god if old age will onlypermit us 
 cle but god will be gracious 
 ath yes and under his guidance let us consider further point 
 cle what is it 
 ath let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creationthis our city is 
 cle what had you in your mind when you said that 
 ath i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we areordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws nowa man need not be very wise cleinias in order to see that no one caneasily receive laws at their first imposition but if we couldanyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from have been nurtured in them and become habituated to them taketheir part in the public elections of the state i say if thiscould be accomplished and rightly accomplished by any way i think that there would be very little danger atthe end of the time of a state thus trained not being permanent 
 cle a reasonable supposition 
 ath then let us consider if we can find any way out of thedifficulty for i maintain cleinias that the cnosians above all theother cretans should not be satisfied with barely discharging theirduty to the colony but they ought to take the utmost pains toestablish the offices which are first created by them in the bestand surest manner above all this applies to the selection of theguardians of the law who must be chosen first of all and with thegreatest care the others are of less importance 
 cle what method can we devise of electing them 
 ath this will be the of the cretans i shall say tothem inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the otherstates they should in common with those who join this a body of in all nineteen of them being takenfrom the settlers and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus ofthose latter the cnosians shall make a present to your colony and youyourself shall be one of the eighteen and shall become a citizen ofthe new state and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go thecnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you 
 cle but why stranger do not you and megillus take a part in ournew city 
 ath o cleinias athens is proud and sparta too and they are botha long way off but you and likewise the other colonists areconveniently situated as you describe i have been speaking of the wayin which the new citizens may be best managed under presentcircumstances but in if the city continues to the election be on this wise all who are horse or footsoldiers or have seen military service at the proper ages when theywere severally fitted for it shall share in the election ofmagistrates and the election shall be held in whatever temple thestate deems most venerable and every one shall carry his vote tothe altar of the god writing down on a tablet the name of theperson for whom he votes and his name and his tribe andward and at the side he shall write his own name in like one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not thinkproperly filled up and exhibit it in the agara for a period of notless than thirty days the tablets which are judged to be first tothe number of shall be shown by the magistrates to the wholecity and the citizens shall in like manner select from these thecandidates whom they prefer and this second selection to thenumber of shall be again exhibited to the citizens in the any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the walkingthrough the parts of victims and let them choose for magistratesand proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number ofvotes but who cleinias and megillus will order for us in the colonyall this matter of the magistrates and the scrutinies of them ifwe reflect we shall see that cities which are in process ofconstruction like ours must have some such persons who cannotpossibly be elected before there are any magistrates and yet theymust be elected in some way and they are not to be inferior the best possible for as the proverb says a good beginning ishalf the business and to have begun well is praised by all and inmy opinion is a great deal more than half the business and hasnever been praised by any one enough 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then let us recognize the difficulty and make clear to our ownminds how the beginning is to be accomplished there is only oneproposal which i have to offer and that is one which under ourcircumstances is both necessary and expedient 
 cle what is it 
 ath i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and are no other than the colonizing state well i know that manycolonies have been and will be at enmity with their parents butin early days the child as in a family loves and is beloved even ifthere come a time later when the tie is broken still while he isin want of education he naturally loves his parents and is beloved bythem and flies to his relatives for protection and finds in them hisonly natural allies in time of need and this parental feeling alreadyexists in the cnosians as is shown by their care of the new city andthere is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towardscnosus and i repeat what i was there is no harm inrepeating a good the cnosians should take a common interestin all these matters and choose as far as they can the eldest andbest of the colonists to the number of not less than a hundred andlet there be another hundred of the cnosians themselves these i their arrival should have a joint care that the magistrates shouldbe appointed according to law and that when they are appointed theyshould undergo a scrutiny when this has been effected the cnosiansshall return home and the new city do the best she can for her ownpreservation and happiness i would have the now andin all future time chosen to fulfil the following the first place be the guardians of the law and secondly of theregisters in which each one registers before the magistrate the amountof his property excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens ofthe first class three allowed to the second two to the third anda single mina to the fourth and if any one despising the laws forthe sake of gain be found to possess anything more which has not beenregistered let all that he has in excess be confiscated and lethim be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable orfortunate and let any one who will indict him on the charge ofloving base gains and proceed against him before the guardians of thelaw and if he be cast let him lose his share of the publicpossessions and when there is any public distribution let him havenothing but his original lot and let him be written down acondemned man as long as he lives in some place in which any onewho pleases can read about his onces the guardian of the law shallnot hold office longer than twenty years and shall not be less thanfifty years of age when he is elected or if he is elected when heis sixty years of age he shall hold office for ten years only andupon the same principle he must not imagine that he will be permittedto hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws afterhe is seventy years of age if he live so long 
 these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the the work of legislation progresses each law in turn will assign tothem their further duties and now we may proceed in order to speak ofthe election of other officers for generals have to be elected andthese again must have their ministers commanders and colonels ofhorse and commanders of brigades of foot who would be more rightlycalled by their popular name of brigadiers the guardians of the lawshall propose as generals men who are natives of the city and aselection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those whoare or have been of the age for military service and if one who isnot proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who him name whom he prefers in the place of whom and make oaththat he is better and propose him and whichever of them isapproved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection and thethree who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointedgenerals and superintendents of military affairs after previouslyundergoing a scrutiny like the guardians of the law and let thegenerals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers one for each there shall be a right of counterproposal as in the case of thegenerals and the voting and decision shall take place in the sameway until the prytanes and council are elected the guardians ofthe law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitableto the purpose placing the hoplites by themselves and the cavalry bythemselves and in a third division all the rest of the army allare to vote for the generals and for the colonels of horse butthe brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry the hoplites let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs forthe generals but captains of light troops or archers or any otherdivision of the army shall be appointed by the generals forthemselves there only remains the appointment of officers of shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the the election and the of other candidates shall bearranged in the same way as in the case of the generals and let thecavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election the two whohave the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all thehorse disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice but ifthe dispute be raised a third time the officers who preside at theseveral elections shall decide 
 the council shall consist of x members will be aconvenient number for if we divide the whole number intofour parts of ninety each we get ninety counsellors for each all the citizens shall select candidates from the firstclass they shall be compelled to vote and if they do not shallbe duly fined when the candidates have been selected some oneshall mark them down this shall be the business of the first day andon the following day candidates shall be selected from the secondclass in the same manner and under the same conditions as on theprevious day and on the third day a selection shall be made fromthe third class at which every one may if he likes vote and thethree first classes shall be compelled to vote but the fourth andlowest class shall be under no compulsion and any member of thisclass who does not vote shall not be punished on the fourth daycandidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest shall be selected by all but he who is of the fourth class shallsuffer no penalty nor he who is of the third if he be not willing tovote but he who is of the first or second class if he does notvote shall be who is of the second class shall pay a fineof triple the amount which was exacted at first and he who is ofthe first class quadruple on the fifth day the rulers shall bring outthe names noted down for all the citizens to see and every man shallchoose out of them under pain if he do not of suffering the firstpenalty and when they have chosen out of each of the classes theyshall choose of them by lot who shall undergo are to form the council for the year 
 the mode of election which has been described is in a mean betweenmonarchy and democracy and such a mean the state ought always toobserve for servants and masters never can be friends nor good andbad merely because they are declared to have equal privileges for tounequals equals become unequal if they are not harmonized by both by reason of equality and by reason of inequality citiesare filled with seditions the old saying that equality makesfriendship is happy and also true but there is obscurity andconfusion as to what sort of equality is meant for there are twoequalities which are called by the same name but are in reality inmany ways almost the opposite of one another one of them may beintroduced without difficulty by any state or any legislator in thedistribution of honours this is the rule of measure weight andnumber which regulates and apportions them but there is anotherequality of a better and higher kind which is not so easilyrecognized this is the judgment of zeus among men it avails butlittle that little however is the source of the greatest good toindividuals and states for it gives to the greater more and to theinferior less and in proportion to the nature of each and above honour always to the greater virtue and to the less less andto either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue andeducation and this is justice and is ever the true principle ofstates at which we ought to aim and according to this rule order thenew city which is now being founded and any other city which may behereafter founded to this the legislator should to theinterests of tyrants one or more or to the power of the people butto justice always which as i was saying the distribution of naturalequality among unequals in each case but there are times at whichevery state is compelled to use the words just equal in asecondary sense in the hope of escaping in some degree from equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strictrule of justice and this is the reason why we are obliged to usethe equality of the lot in order to avoid the discontent of thepeople and so we invoke god and fortune in our prayers and begthat they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supremejustice and therefore although we are compelled to use bothequalities we should use that into which the element of chance entersas seldom as possible 
 thus o my friends and for the reasons given should a state actwhich would endure and be saved but as a ship sailing on the seahas to be watched night and day in like manner a city also is sailingon a sea of politics and is liable to all sorts of insidiousassaults and therefore from morning to night and from night tomorning rulers must join hands with rulers and watchers withwatchers receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetualsuccession now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sortwith anything like energy moreover the greater number of thesenators will have to be left during the greater part of the year toorder their concerns at their own homes they will therefore have tobe arranged in twelve portions answering to the twelve months andfurnish guardians of the state each portion for a single month theirbusiness is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen whocomes to them whether to give information or to put one of thosequestions to which when asked by other cities a city should give ananswer and to which if she ask them herself she should receive ananswer or again when there is a likelihood of internal are always liable to happen in some form or other they will ifthey can prevent their occurring or if they have already lose time in making them known to the city and healing the also this which is the presiding body of the state oughtalways to have the control of their assemblies and of thedissolutions of them ordinary as well as extraordinary all this isto be ordered by the twelfth part of the council which is always tokeep watch together with the other officers of the state during oneportion of the year and to rest during the remaining eleven portions 
 thus will the city be fairly ordered and now who is to have thesuperintendence of the country and what shall be the that the whole city and the entire country have been both ofthem divided into twelve portions ought there not to be appointedsuperintendents of the streets of the city and of the houses andbuildings and harbours and the agora and fountains and sacreddomains and temples and the like

 after the wardens of the country we have to speak of the electionof wardens of the agora and of the city the wardens of the countrywere sixty in number and the wardens of the city will be three andwill divide the twelve parts of the city into three like theformer they shall have care of the ways and of the different highroads which lead out of the country into the city and of thebuildings that they may be all made according to of thewaters which the guardians of the supply preserve and convey to being taken that they may reach the fountains pure andabundant and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city thesealso should be men of influence and at leisure to take care of thepublic interest let every man propose as warden of the city any onewhom he likes out of the highest class and when the vote has beengiven on them and the number is reduced to the six who have thegreatest number of votes let the electing officers choose by lotthree out of the six and when they have undergone a scrutiny let themhold office according to the laws laid down for them next let thewardens of the agora be elected in like manner out of the first andsecond class five in number ten are to be first elected and outof the ten five are to be chosen by lot as in the election of thewardens of the when they have undergone a scrutiny areto be declared magistrates every one shall vote for every one and hewho will not vote if he be informed against before the be fined fifty drachmae and shall also be deemed a bad any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and secondclass and they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be foundnot answering to their names at the assembly the third and fourthclass shall be under no compulsion and shall be let off without afine unless the magistrates have commanded all to be present inconsequence of some urgent necessity the wardens of the agora shallobserve the order appointed by law for the agora and shall have thecharge of the temples and fountains which are in the agora and theyshall see that no one injures anything and punish him who stripes and bonds if he be a slave or stranger but if he be acitizen who misbehaves in this way they shall have the powerthemselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundreddrachmae or with the consent of the wardens of the city up todouble that amount and let the wardens of the city have a similarpower of imposing punishments and fines in their own department andlet them impose fines by their own department and let them imposefines by their own authority up to a mina or up to two minae withthe consent of the wardens of the agora 
 in the next place it will be proper to appoint directors of musicand gymnastic two kinds of the one kind the business willbe education of the other the superintendence of contests inspeaking of education the law means to speak of those who have thecare of order and instruction in gymnasia and schools and of thegoing to school and of school buildings for boys and girls and inspeaking of contests the law refers to the judges of gymnastics andof music these again are divided into two classes the one havingto do with music the other with gymnastics and the same who judge ofthe gymnastic contests of men shall judge of horses but in musicthere shall be one set of judges of solo singing and of of rhapsodists players on the harp the flute and the another who shall judge of choral song first of all we mustchoose directors for the choruses of boys and men and they shall follow in the amusement of the dance and for ourother musical arrangements one director will be enough for thechoruses and he should be not less than forty years of age onedirector will also be enough to introduce the solo singers and togive judgment on the competitors and he ought not to be less thanthirty years of age the director and manager of the choruses shall beelected after the following any persons who commonlytake an interest in such matters go to the meeting and be fined ifthey do not go the guardians of the law shall judge of theirfault but those who have no interest shall not be compelled theelector shall propose as director some one who understands he in the scrutiny may be challenged on the one part by thosewho say he has no skill and defended on the other hand by those whosay that he has ten are to be elected by vote and he of the tenwho is chosen by lot shall undergo a scrutiny and lead the chorusesfor a year according to law and in like manner the competitor whowins the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for thatyear and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award to thejudges in the next place we have to choose judges in the contests ofhorses and of men these shall be selected from the third and alsofrom the second class of citizens and three first classes shall becompelled to go to the election but the lowest may stay away withimpunity and let there be three elected by lot out of the twentywho have been chosen previously and they must also have the voteand approval of the examiners but if any one is rejected in thescrutiny at any ballot or decision others shall be chosen in the samemanner and undergo a similar scrutiny 
 there remains the minister of the education of youth male andfemale he too will rule according to law one such minister will besufficient and he must be fifty years old and have children lawfullybegotten both boys and girls by preference at any rate one or theother he who is elected and he who is the elector should considerthat of all the great offices of state this is the greatest forthe first shoot of any plant if it makes a good start towards theattainment of its natural excellence has the greatest effect on itsmaturity and this is not only true of plants but of animals wild andtame and also of men man as we say is a tame or civilizedanimal nevertheless he requires proper instruction and a fortunatenature and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and mostcivilized but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is themost savage of earthly creatures wherefore the legislator ought notto allow the education of children to become a secondary or accidentalmatter in the first place he who would be rightly provident aboutthem should begin by taking care that he is elected who of all thecitizens is in every way best him the legislator shall do hisutmost to appoint guardian and superintendent to this end all themagistrates with the exception of the council and prytanes shallgo to the temple of apollo and elect by ballot him of the guardiansof the law whom they severally think will be the best superintendentof education and he who has the greatest number of votes after hehas undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates whohave been his electors with the exception of the guardians of hold office for five years and in the sixth year letanother be chosen in like manner to fill his office 
 if any one dies while he is holding a public office and more thanthirty days before his term of office expires let those whosebusiness it is elect another to the office in the same manner asbefore and if any one who is entrusted with orphans dies let therelations both on the and side who are residingat home including cousins appoint another guardian within tendays or be fined a drachma a day for neglect to do so 
 a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city andagain if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminaryproceedings than the litigants as is the case in arbitrations hewill never be able to decide justly wherefore a multitude of judgeswill not easily judge well nor a few if they are bad the point indispute between the parties should be made clear and time anddeliberation and repeated examination greatly tend to clear updoubts for this reason he who goes to law with another should gofirst of all to his neighbours and friends who know best the questionsat issue and if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactorydecision let him have recourse to another court and if the twocourts cannot settle the matter let a third put an end to the suit 
 now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as achoice of magistrates for every magistrate must also be a judge ofsome things and the judge though he be not a magistrate yet incertain respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which heis determining a suit regarding then the judges also asmagistrates let us say who are fit to be judges and of what they areto be judges and how many of them are to judge in each suit let thatbe the supreme tribunal which the litigants appoint in common forthemselves choosing certain persons by agreement and let there betwo other tribunals one for private causes when a citizen accusesanother of wronging him and wishes to get a decision the other forpublic causes in which some citizen is of opinion that the public hasbeen wronged by an individual and is willing to vindicate thecommon interests and we must not forget to mention how the judges areto be qualified and who they are to be in the first place let therebe a tribunal open to all private persons who are trying causes oneagainst another for the third time and let this be composed the officers of state as well annual as those holdingoffice for a longer period when the new year is about to commence inthe month following after the summer solstice on the last day but oneof the year shall meet in some temple and calling god to dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be choosing in each office him who seems to them to bethe best and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of during the ensuing year in the best and holiestmanner and when the election is completed a scrutiny shall be heldin the presence of the electors themselves and if any one be rejectedanother shall be chosen in the same manner those who have undergonethe scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined theinferior courts and shall give their vote openly the councillors andother magistrates who have elected them shall be required to behearers and spectators of the causes and any one else may bepresent who pleases if one man charges another with havingintentionally decided wrong let him go to the guardians of the lawand lay his accusation before them and he who is found guilty in sucha case shall pay damages to the injured party equal to half theinjury but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty thejudges shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer andhow much more he ought to pay to the public treasury and to the partywho brought the suit 
 in the judgment of offences against the state the people ought toparticipate for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged andmay reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in thedecision such causes ought to originate with the people and theought also to have the final decision of them but the trial of themshall take place before three of the highest magistrates upon whomthe plaintiff and the defendant shall agree and if they are notable to come to an agreement themselves the council shall chooseone of the two proposed and in private suits too as far as ispossible all should have a share for he who has no share in theadministration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share inthe state at all and for this reason there shall be a court of law inevery tribe and the judges shall be chosen by shall givetheir decisions at once and shall be inaccessible to final judgment shall rest with that court which as we been established in the most incorruptible form of which humanthings admit this shall be the court established for those who areunable to get rid of their suits either in the courts of neighbours orof the tribes 
 thus much of the courts of law which as i was saying cannot beprecisely defined either as being or not being offices asuperficial sketch has been given of them in which some things havebeen told and others omitted for the right place of an exactstatement of the laws respecting suits under their several be at the end of the body of us then expect themat the end hitherto our legislation has been chiefly occupied withthe appointment of offices perfect unity and exactness extendingto the whole and every particular of political be attained to the full until the discussion shall have abeginning middle and end and is complete in every part atpresent we have reached the election of magistrates and this may beregarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded and now thereneed no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work oflegislation 
 cle i like what you have said i particularly likeyour manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to theend of the former one 
 ath thus far then the old rational pastime has gone offwell 
 cle you mean i suppose their serious and noble pursuit 
 ath perhaps but i should like to know whether you and i are agreedabout a certain thing 
 cle about what thing 
 ath you know the endless labour which painters expend upon are always putting in or taking out colours or whateverbe the term which artists employ they seem as if they would nevercease touching up their works which are always being made brighterand more beautiful 
 cle i know something of these matters from report although ihave never had any great acquaintance with the art 
 ath no matter we may make use of the that some one had a mind to paint a figure inthe most beautiful manner in the hope that his work instead of losingwould always improve as time went you not see that being amortal unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correctthe flaws which time may introduce and be able to add what is leftimperfect through the defect of the artist and who will furtherbrighten up and improve the picture all his great labour will lastbut a short time 
 cle true 
 ath and is not the aim of the legislator similar first he desiresthat his laws should be written down with all possible exactness inthe second place as time goes on and he has made an actual trial ofhis decrees will he not find omissions do you imagine that thereever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things arenecessarily omitted which some one coming after him must the constitution and the order of government is not to to improve in the state which he has established 
 cle assuredly that is the sort of thing which every one woulddesire 
 ath and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this byword or deed or has any way great or small by which he can teach aperson to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws he shouldfinish what he has to say and not leave the work incomplete 
 cle by all means 
 ath and is not this what you and i have to do at the presentmoment 
 cle what have we to do 
 ath as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians ofthe law and are ourselves in the evening of life and they ascompared with us are young men we ought not only to legislate forthem but to endeavour to make them not only guardians of the lawbut legislators themselves as far as this is possible 
 cle certainly if we can 
 ath at any rate we must do our best 
 cle of course 
 ath we will say to friends and saviours of our laws inlaying down any law there are many particulars which we shall this cannot be helped at the same time we will do our utmostto describe what is important and will give an outline which youshall fill up and i will explain on what principle you are to and cleinias and i have often spoken to one anothertouching these matters and we are of opinion that we have spokenwell and we hope that you will be of the same mind with us andbecome our disciples and keep in view the things which in ourunited opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep inview there was one main point about which we were a energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition ofthe virtue proper to a man whether this was to be gained by study orhabit or some mode of acquisition or desire or opinion this applies equally to men and women old and of all should always be such as i have described anything whichmay be an impediment the good man ought to show that he utterlydisregards and if at last necessity plainly compels him to be anoutlaw from his native land rather than bow his neck to the yoke ofslavery and be ruled by inferiors and he has to fly an exile he mustbe and endure all such trials rather than accept another form ofgovernment which is likely to make men worse these are ouroriginal principles and do you now fixing your eyes upon thestandard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to and blame the those which have not this power ofmaking the citizen better but embrace those which have and withgladness receive and live in them bidding a long farewell to otherinstitutions which aim at goods as they are termed of a differentkind 
 let us proceed to another class of laws beginning with theirfoundation in religion and we must first return to the entire number had and has a great many convenientdivisions and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part ofthe whole being correctly formed by x x also has them and not only is the whole numberdivisible by twelve but also the number of each tribe is divisible bytwelve now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift ofheaven corresponding to the months and to the revolution of theuniverse every city has a guiding and sacred principle given bynature but in some the division or distribution has been more rightthan in others and has been more sacred and fortunate in ouropinion nothing can be more right than the selection of the number which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve withthe single exception of eleven and that admits of a very easycorrection for if turning to the dividend we deduct twofamilies the defect in the division is cured and the truth of thismay be easily proved when we have leisure but for the to the mere assertion of this principle let us divide thestate and assigning to each portion some god or son of a god letus give them altars and sacred rites and at the altars let us holdassemblies for sacrifice twice in the assemblies forthe tribes and twelve for the city according to their divisions thefirst in honour of the gods and divine things and the second topromote friendship and better acquaintance as the phrase is andevery sort of good fellowship with one another for people must beacquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and withthose to whom they give in marriage in such matters as far aspossible a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake andwith this serious purpose let games be instituted in which youthsand maidens shall dance together seeing one another and being seennaked at a proper age and on a suitable occasion nottransgressing the rules of modesty 
 the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulatorsof these games and they together with the guardians of the law willlegislate in any matters which we have omitted for as we said wherethere are numerous and minute details the legislator must leave outsomething and the annual officers who have experience and knowwhat is wanted must make arrangements and improvements year byyear until such enactments and provisions are sufficientlydetermined a ten years experience of sacrifices and dances ifextending to all particulars will be quite sufficient and if thelegislator be alive they shall communicate with him but if he be deadthen the several officers shall refer the omissions which come undertheir notice to the guardians of the law and correct them untilall is perfect and from that time there shall be no more they shall establish and use the new laws with the others whichthe legislator originally gave them and of which they are never ifthey can help to change aught or if some necessity overtakesthem the magistrates must be called into counsel and the wholepeople and they must go to all the oracles of the gods and if theyare all agreed in that case they may make the change but if they arenot agreed by no manner of means and any one who dissents shallprevail as the law ordains 
 whenever any one over years of age having seen and beenseen by others believes himself to have found a marriage connectionwhich is to his mind and suitable for the procreation of him marry if he be still under the age of let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable andappropriate for as cleinias says every law should have a suitableprelude 
 cle you recollect at the right moment stranger and do not missthe opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season 
 ath i thank you we will say to him who is born of good son you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage norspecially to desire a rich one but if other things are to honour inferiors and with them to form be for the benefit of the city and of the families which areunited for the equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more tovirtue than the unmixed and he who is conscious of being tooheadstrong and carried away more than is fitting in all hisactions ought to desire to become the relation of orderly he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the oppositealliance let there be one word concerning all manshall follow not after the marriage which is most pleasing tohimself but after that which is most beneficial to the state forsomehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest tohimself and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in propertyand in disposition and hence there arise in most states the veryresults which we least desire to happen now to add to the law anexpress provision not only that the rich man shall not marry into therich family nor the powerful into the family of the powerful butthat the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage withthe quicker and the quicker with the slower may awaken anger as wellas laughter in the minds of many for there is a difficulty inperceiving that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup in whichthe maddening wine is hot and fiery but when chastened by a soberergod receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent andtemperate drink yet in marriage no one is able to see that the sameresult occurs wherefore also the law must let alone such matters butwe should try to charm the spirits of men into believing theequability of their disposition to be of more importancethan equality in excessive fortune when they marry and him who is toodesirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn asideby reproaches not however by any compulsion of written law 
 let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage and let usremember what was said a man should cling toimmortality and leave behind him children to be theservants of god in his place for ever all this and much more may betruly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage but if aman will not listen and remains unsocial and alien among and is still unmarried at years of him pay a yearly who of the highest class shall pay afine of a hundred drachmae and he who is of the second dass a fine ofseventy drachmae the third class shall pay sixty drachmae and thefourth thirty drachmae and let the money be sacred to here he whodoes not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum whichthe treasurer of the goddess shall exact and if he fails in doing him be answerable and give an account of the money at hisaudit he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money andalso be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the no young man voluntarily obey him and if he attempt to punish anyone let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured he who is present and does not come to the rescue shall bepronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen of themarriage portion i have already spoken and again i say for theinstruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowryon account of poverty has a compensation for the citizens of ourstate are provided with the necessaries of life and wives will beless likely to be insolent and husbands to be mean and subservient tothem on account of property and he who obeys this law will do a nobleaction but he who will not obey and gives or receives more thanfifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of thelowest or more than a mina or a mina if he be of thethird or second classes or two minae if he be of the highest owe to the public treasury a similar sum and that which isgiven or received shall be sacred to here and zeus and let thetreasurers of these gods exact the money as was said before about the treasurers of here were to exact the money orpay the fine themselves 
 the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree thatby a grandfather in the second degree and in the third by brothers who have the same father but if there arenone of these alive the betrothal by a mother shall be valid inlike manner in cases of unexampled fatality the next of kin andthe guardians shall have authority what are to be the rites beforemarriages or any other sacred acts relating either to or past marriages shall be referred to the interpreters andhe who follows their advice may be satisfied touching the marriagefestival they shall assemble not more than five male and fivefemale friends of both families and a like number of members of thefamily of either sex and no man shall spend more than his meanswill allow he who is of the richest class may spend a whois of the second half a mina and in the same proportion as thecensus of each decreases all men shall praise him who is obedientto the law but he who is disobedient shall be punished by theguardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste anduninstructed in the laws of bridal song drunkenness is alwaysimproper except at the festivals of the god who gave wine andpeculiarly dangerous when a man is engaged in the business ofmarriage at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom oughtto have all their wits about ought to take care that theiroffspring may be born of reasonable beings for on what day or nightheaven will give them increase who can say moreover they oughtnot to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated byintoxication but their offspring should be compact and solid quietand compounded properly whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all hisactions and beside himself both in body and soul wherefore drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable anduntrustworthy and cannot be expected to walk straight either inbody or mind hence during the whole year and all his life long andespecially while he is begetting children ought to take care andnot intentionally do what is injurious to health or what involvesinsolence and wrong for he cannot help leaving the impression ofhimself on the souls and bodies of his offspring and he begetschildren in every way inferior and especially on the day and night ofmarriage should a man abstain from such things for the is also a god dwelling in man preserves all things if itmeet with proper respect from each individual he who marries isfurther to consider that one of the two houses in the lot is thenest and nursery of his young and there he is to marry and make ahome for himself and bring up his children going away from his fatherand mother for in friendships there must be some degree of desire inorder to cement and bind together diversities of character butexcessive intercourse not having the desire which is created bytime insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father andmother their own and themselves go as to a colony anddwell there and visit and be visited by their parents and they shallbeget and bring up children handing on the torch of life from onegeneration to another and worshipping the gods according to law forever 
 in the next place we have to consider what sort of property will bemost convenient there is no difficulty either in understanding oracquiring most kinds of property but there is great difficulty inwhat relates to slaves and the reason is that we speak about themin a way which is right and which is not right for what we sayabout our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent with our practiceabout them 
 megillus i do not understand stranger what you mean 
 ath i am not surprised megillus for the state of the helots amongthe lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the mostcontroverted and disputed about some approving and some condemningit there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among theheracleots who have subjugated the mariandynians and about thethessalian penestae looking at these and the like examples whatought we to do concerning property in slaves i made a remark inpassing which naturally elicited a question about my meaning fromyou it was know that all would agree that we should have thebest and most attached slaves whom we can get for many a man hasfound his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons and manytimes they have saved the lives and property of their masters andtheir whole tales are well known 
 meg to be sure 
 ath but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterlycorrupt and that no man of sense ought to trust them and thewisest of our poets speaking of zeus says 
 zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom theday of slavery persons have got these two different notions of slaves intheir of them utterly distrust their servants and as ifthey were wild beasts chastise them with goads and whips and maketheir souls three times or rather many times as slavish as they others do just the opposite 
 meg true 
 cle then what are we to do in our own country stranger seeingthat there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by theirowners 
 ath well cleinias there can be no doubt that man is a troublesomeanimal and therefore he is not very manageable nor likely tobecome so when you attempt to introduce the necessary and freeman and master 
 cle that is obvious 
 ath he is a troublesome piece of goods as has been often shownby the frequent revolts of the messenians and the great mischiefswhich happen in states having many slaves who speak the same the numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian they are called a man who considers all this is fairly at aloss two remedies alone remain to to have the slaves of thesame country nor if possible speaking the same language in this waythey will more easily be held in subjection secondly we shouldtend them carefully not only out of regard to them but yet moreout of respect to ourselves and the right treatment of slaves is tobehave properly to them and to do to them if possible even morejustice than to those who are our equals for he who naturally andgenuinely reverences justice and hates injustice is discovered inhis dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves isundefiled by impiety and injustice will best sow the seeds ofvirtue in them and this may be truly said of every master andtyrant and of every other having authority in relation to hisinferiors slaves ought to be punished as they deserve and notadmonished as if they were freemen which will only make themconceited the language used to a servant ought always to be that of acommand and we ought not to jest with them whether they are males is a foolish way which many people have of setting uptheir slaves and making the life of servitude more disagreeableboth for them and for their masters 
 cle true 
 ath now that each of the citizens is provided as far aspossible with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help himin what he has to do we may next proceed to describe their dwellings 
 cle very good 
 ath the city being new and hitherto uninhabited care ought to betaken of all the buildings and the manner of building each of also of the temples and walls these cleinias were matters whichproperly came before the marriages but as we are only talking thereis no objection to changing the order if however our plan oflegislation is ever to take effect then the house shall precede themarriage if god so will and afterwards we will come to theregulations about marriage but at present we are only describingthese matters in a general outline 
 cle quite true 
 ath the temples are to be placed all round the agora and the wholecity built on the heights in a circle for the sake of defence and forthe sake of purity near the temples are to be placed buildings forthe magistrates and the courts of law in these plaintiff anddefendant will receive their due and the places will be regarded asmost holy partly because they have to do with the holy things andpartly because they are the of holy gods and inthem will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and othertrials of capital offenses may fitly take place as to the i agree with sparta in thinking that they should beallowed to sleep in the earth and that we should not attempt todisinter them there is a poetical saying which is finelyexpressed that walls ought to be of steel and iron and not ofearth besides how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young menannually into the country to dig and to trench and to keep off theenemy by fortifications under the idea that they are not to beallowed to set foot in our territory and then that we shouldsurround ourselves with a wall which in the first place is by nomeans conducive to the health of cities and is also apt to producea certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants inviting mento run thither instead of repelling their enemies and leading them toimagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day andnight but that when they are protected by walls and gates thenthey may sleep in safety as if they were not meant to labour and didnot know that true repose comes from labour and that disgracefulindolence and a careless temper of mind is only the renewal oftrouble but if men must have walls the private houses ought to be soarranged from the first that the whole city may be one wall havingall the houses capable of defence by reason of their uniformity andequality towards the streets the form of the city being that of asingle dwelling will have an agreeable aspect and being easilyguarded will be infinitely better for security until the originalbuilding is completed these should be the principal objects of theinhabitants and the wardens of the city should superintend thework and should impose a fine on him who is negligent and in allthat relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness andnot allow a private person to encroach upon any public property eitherby buildings or excavations further they ought to take care that therains from heaven flow off easily and of any other matters whichmay have to be administered either within or without the city theguardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which theirexperience may show to be necessary and supply any other points inwhich the law may be deficient and now that these matters and thebuildings about the agora and the gymnasia and places ofinstruction and theatres are all ready and waiting for scholarsand spectators let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriagein the order of legislation 
 cle by all means 
 ath assuming that marriages exist already cleinias the mode oflife during the year after marriage before children are born willfollow next in order in what way bride and bridegroom ought to livein a city which is to be superior to other cities is a matter notat all easy for us to determine there have been many difficultiesalready but this will be the greatest of them and the mostdisagreeable to the many still i cannot but say what appears to me tobe right and true cleinias 
 cle certainly 
 ath he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct ofstates while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to takecare of itself who thinks that individuals may pass the day as theyplease and that there is no necessity of order in all things he isay who gives up the control of their private lives and supposesthat they will conform to law in their common and public life ismaking a great mistake why have i made this remark why because i amgoing to enact that the bridegrooms should live at the commontables just as they did before marriage this was a singularitywhen first enacted by the legislator in your parts of the and cleinias as i should suppose on the occasion of somewar or other similar danger which caused the passing of the which would be likely to occur in places and intimes of pressure but when men had once tried and been accustomedto a common table experience showed that the institution greatlyconduced to security and in some such manner the custom of havingcommon tables arose among you 
 cle likely enough 
 ath i said that there may have been singularity and danger inimposing such a custom at first but that now there is not the samedifficulty there is however another institution which is thenatural sequel to this and would be excellent if it existedanywhere but at present it does not the institution of which i amabout to speak is not easily described or executed and would belike the legislator combing wool into the fire as people say orperforming any other impossible and useless feat 
 cle what is the cause stranger of this extreme hesitation 
 ath you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time that whichhas law and order in a state is the cause of every good but thatwhich is disordered or is often the ruin of that whichis and at this point the argument is now waiting forwith you cleinias and megillus the common tables of men are as isaid a and admirable institution but you are mistaken inleaving the women unregulated by law they have no similar institutionof public tables in the light of day and just that part of thehuman race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth onaccount of their mean the female been leftwithout regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake consequence of this neglect many things have grown lax amongyou which might have been far better if they had been only regulatedby law for the neglect of regulations about women may not only beregarded as a neglect of half the entire matter but in proportionas nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for that degree the consequence of such neglect is more than twice asimportant the careful consideration of this matter and the arrangingand ordering on a common principle of all our institutions relatingboth to men and women greatly conduces to the happiness of the at present such is the unfortunate condition of mankind thatno man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables inplaces and cities in which they have never been established at how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous who attempts tocompel women to show in public how much they eat and drink there isnothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence for women areaccustomed to creep into dark places and when dragged out into thelight they will exert their utmost powers of resistance and be fartoo much for the legislator and therefore as i said before inmost places they will not endure to have the truth spoken withoutraising a tremendous outcry but in this state perhaps they may andif we may assume that our whole discussion about the state has notbeen mere idle talk i should like to prove to you if you willconsent to listen that this institution is good and proper but ifyou had rather not i will refrain 
 cle there is nothing which we should both of us like than to hear what you have to say 
 ath very good and you must not be surprised if i go back a we have plenty of leisure and there is nothing to prevent us fromconsidering in every point of view the subject of law 
 cle true 
 ath then let us return once more to what we were saying at man should understand that the human race either had nobeginning at all and will never have an end but always will be andhas been or that it began an immense while ago 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and have there not been constitutions and destructions ofstates and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly anddiverse desires of meats and drinks always and in all the all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may beexpected to have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and may we not suppose that vines appeared which hadpreviously no existence and also olives and the gifts of demeter andher daughter of which one triptolemus was the minister and these existed animals took to devouring each other as theydo still 
 cle true 
 ath again the practice of men sacrificing one another still existsamong many nations while on the other hand we hear of other humanbeings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and had noanimal sacrifices but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey andsimilar pure offerings but no flesh of animals from these theyabstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them and mightnot stain the altars of the gods with blood for in those days men aresaid to have lived a sort of orphic life having the use of alllifeless things but abstaining from all living things 
 cle such has been the constant tradition and is very likely true 
 ath some one might say to us what is the drift of all this 
 cle a very pertinent question stranger 
 ath and therefore i will endeavour cleinias if i can to draw thenatural inference 
 cle proceed 
 ath i see that among men all things depend upon three wants anddesires of which the end is virtue if they are rightly led bythem or the opposite if wrongly now these are eating and begin at animal has a natural desire for them andis violently excited and rebels against him who says that he must notsatisfy all his pleasures and appetites and get rid of all thecorresponding the third and greatest and sharpest want anddesire breaks out last and is the fire of sexual lust whichkindles in men every species of wantonness and madness and thesethree disorders we must endeavour to master by the three greatprinciples of fear and law and right reason turning them away fromthat which is called pleasantest to the best using the muses andthe gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase andinflux 
 but to marriage let us speak of the birth of after their birth of their nurture and education in the course ofdiscussion the several laws will be perfected and we shall at lastarrive at the common tables whether such associations are to beconfined to men or extended to women also we shall see better whenwe approach and take a nearer view of them and we may thendetermine what previous institutions are required and will have toprecede them as i said before we shall see them more in detail andshall be better able to lay down the laws which are proper or suitedto them 
 cle very true 
 ath let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken forhereafter there may be need of them 
 cle what do you bid us keep in mind 
 ath that which we comprehended under the three drinking thirdly the excitement of love 
 cle we shall be sure to remember stranger 
 ath very good then let us now proceed to marriage and teachpersons in what way they shall beget children threatening them ifthey disobey with the terrors of the law 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are toproduce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children whichthey can now all men who are associated any action always succeedwhen they attend and give their mind to what they are doing butwhen they do not give their mind or have no mind they fail whereforelet the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begettingof children and the bride in like manner give her mind to thebridegroom and particularly at the time when their children are notyet born and let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers ofsuch matters and let them in whatever number large or small andat whatever time the magistrates may command assemble every day inthe temple of eileithyia during a third part of the day and beingthere assembled let them inform one another of any one whom they man or woman of those who are begetting the ordinances given at the time when the nuptialsacrifices and ceremonies were performed let the begetting ofchildren and the supervision of those who are begetting themcontinue ten years and no longer during the time when marriage isfruitful but if any continue without children up to this time letthem take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding theoffice of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit any dispute arises about what is proper and for theinterest of either party they shall choose ten of the guardians ofthe law and abide by their permission and appointment the women whopreside over these matters shall enter into the houses of the partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give overtheir folly and error if they persist let the women go and tellthe guardians of the law and the guardians shall prevent them but ifthey too cannot prevent them they shall bring the matter before thepeople and let them write up their names and make oath that theycannot reform such and such an one and let him who is thus writtenup if he cannot in a court of law convict those who have inscribedhis name be deprived of the privileges of a citizen in thefollowing him not go to weddings nor to thethanksgivings after the birth of children and if he go let any onewho pleases strike him with impunity and let the same regulationshold about women let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad orreceive honour or go to nuptial and birthday festivals if she inlike manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain averdict and if when they themselves have done begetting childrenaccording to the law a man or woman have connection with anotherman or woman who are still begetting children let the samepenalties be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still havinga family and when the time for procreation has passed let the manor woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem and let thosewho do not refrain be held in the contrary of is to now if the greater part of mankind behave modestly theenactments of law may be left to slumber but if they are enactments having been passed let them be carried into every man the first year is the beginning of life and the timeof birth ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers asthe beginning of existence to every child whether boy or girl letevery phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names of thesuccessive archons by whom the years are reckoned and near to themlet the living members of the phratria be inscribed and when theydepart life let them be erased the limit of marriageable ages for awoman shall be from sixteen to twenty years at the aman from thirty to years and let a woman hold officeat forty and a man at thirty years let a man go out to war fromtwenty to sixty years and for a woman if there appear any need tomake use of her in military service let the time of service beafter she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years ofage and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each

 book vii 
 
 and now assuming children of both sexes to have been born itwill be proper for us to consider in the next place their nurtureand education this cannot be left altogether unnoticed and yet maybe thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than forlaw in private life there are many little things not alwaysapparent arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires ofindividuals which run counter to the intention of the legislator andmake the characters of the citizens various and is anevil in states for by reason of their smallness and frequentoccurrence there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety inmaking them penal by law and if made penal they are thedestruction of the written law because mankind get the habit offrequently transgressing the law in small matters the result isthat you cannot legislate about them and still less can you besilent i speak somewhat darkly but i shall endeavour also to bringmy wares into the light of day for i acknowledge that at presentthere is a want of clearness in what i am saying 
 cleinias very true 
 athenian stranger am i not right in maintaining that a goodeducation is that which tends most to the improvement of mind andbody 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies arethose which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner 
 cle certainly 
 ath and do we not further observe that the first shoot of everyliving thing is by far the greatest and fullest many will evencontend that a man at does not reach twice the heightwhich he attained at five 
 cle true 
 ath well and is not rapid growth without proper and abundantexercise the source endless evils in the body 
 cle yes 
 ath and the body should have the most exercise when it receivesmost nourishment 
 cle but stranger are we to impose this great amount of exerciseupon infants 
 ath nay rather on the bodies of infants still unborn 
 cle what do you mean my good sir in the process of gestation 
 ath exactly i am not at all surprised that you have never heard ofthis very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little although strange i will endeavour to explain to you 
 cle by all means 
 ath the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you byreason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us atathens not only boys but often older persons are in the habit ofkeeping quails and cocks which they train to fight one another andthey are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir themup to fight with one another are sufficient exercise for in additionto this they carry them about tucked beneath their armpits holdingthe smaller birds in their hands the larger under their arms andgo for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health that is tosay not their own health but the health of the birds wherebythey prove to any intelligent person that all bodies are benefited byshakings and movements when they are moved without weariness whethermotion proceeds from themselves or is caused by a swing or at on horseback or by other bodies in whatever way moving and thatthus gaining the mastery over food and drink they are able toimpart beauty and health and strength but admitting all this whatfollows shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant womanshall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion waxbefore it hardens and after birth swathe the infant for two that we compel nurses under penalty of a legal fine to bealways carrying the children somewhere or other either to thetemples or into the country or to their relations houses untilthey are well able to stand and to take care that their limbs are notdistorted by leaning on them when they are too shouldcontinue to carry them until the infant has completed its thirdyear the nurses should be strong and there should be more than oneof them shall these be our rules and shall we impose a penalty forthe neglect of them no no the penalty of which we were speakingwill fall upon our own heads more than enough 
 cle what penalty 
 ath ridicule and the difficulty of getting the feminine dispositions of the nurses to comply 
 cle then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all 
 ath the reason is that masters and freemen in states when theyhear of it are very likely to arrive at a true conviction thatwithout due regulation of private life in cities stability in thelaying down of laws is hardly to be expected and he who makes thisreflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned them may order his house and state well and be happy 
 cle likely enough 
 ath and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we havedetermined the exercises which are suited to the souls of youngchildren in the same manner in which we have begun to go throughthe rules relating to their bodies 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us assume then as a first principle in relation both tothe body and soul of very young creatures that nursing and movingabout by day and night is good for them all and that the younger theyare the more they will need it infants should live if that werepossible as if they were always rocking at sea this is the lessonwhich we may gather from the experience of nurses and likewise fromthe use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the corybantes forwhen mothers want their restless children to go to sleep they do notemploy rest but on the contrary them in theirarms nor do they give them silence but they sing to them and lapthem in sweet strains and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzyin the same manner by the use of the dance and of music 
 cle well stranger and what is the reason of this 
 ath the reason is obvious 
 cle what 
 ath the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children isan emotion of fear which springs out of an evil habit of the when some one applies external agitation to affections of thissort the motion coming from without gets the better of the terribleand violent internal one and produces a peace and calm in the quiets the restless palpitation of the heart which is a thingmuch to be desired sending the children to sleep and making thebacchantes although they remain awake to dance to the pipe withthe help of the gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices andproducing in them a sound mind which takes the place of their to express what i mean in a word there is a good deal to be saidin favour of this treatment 
 cle certainly 
 ath but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from thesefacts that every soul which from youth upward has been familiarwith fears will be made more liable to fear and every one will allowthat this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and on the other hand the habit of overcoming from our youthupwards the fears and terrors which beset us may be said to be anexercise of courage 
 cle true 
 ath and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in theearliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part ofvirtue in the soul 
 cle quite true 
 ath further a cheerful temper or the reverse may be regardedas having much to do with high spirit on the one hand or withcowardice on the other 
 cle to be sure 
 ath then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent wemay if we please without difficulty implant either character inthe young 
 cle certainly 
 ath there is a common opinion that luxury makes the disposition ofyouth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men meanand abject and haters of their kind and therefore makes themundesirable associates 
 cle but how must the state educate those who do not as yetunderstand the language of the country and are therefore incapable ofappreciating any sort of instruction 
 ath i will tell you animal that is born is wont to uttersome cry and this is especially the case with man and he is alsoaffected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal 
 cle quite true 
 ath do not nurses when they want to know what an infant by these anything is brought to the infant and he issilent then he is supposed to be pleased but when he weeps andcries out then he is not pleased for tears and cries are theinauspicious signs by which children show what they love and hate nowthe time which is thus spent is no less than three years and is avery considerable portion of life to be passed ill or well 
 cle true 
 ath does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to youto be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought tobe 
 cle certainly 
 ath well but if during these three years every possible carewere taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and in general of pain as was possible might we not expect in earlychildhood to make his soul more gentle and cheerful 
 cle to be sure especially if we could procure hima variety of pleasures 
 ath there i can no longer agree cleinias you amaze me to bringhim up in such a way would be his utter ruin for the beginning isalways the most critical part of education let us see whether i amright 
 cle proceed 
 ath the point about which you and i differ is of greatimportance and i hope that you megillus will help to decide betweenus for i maintain that the true life should neither seek forpleasures nor on the other hand entirely avoid pains but shouldembrace the middle state which i just spoke of as gentle andbenign and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspirationrightly ascribe to god now i say he among men too who would bedivine ought to pursue after this mean should not rushheadlong into pleasures for he will not be free from pains norshould we allow any one young or old male or female to be thusgiven any more than ourselves and least of all the in infancy more than at any other time the character isengrained by habit nay more if i were not afraid of appearing to beridiculous i would say that a woman during her year of pregnancyshould of all women be most carefully tended and kept from violent orexcessive pleasures and pains and should at that time cultivategentleness and benevolence and kindness 
 cle you need not ask megillus stranger which of us has mosttruly spoken for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid thelife of unmingled pain or pleasure and pursue always a middle having spoken well may i add that you have been well answered 
 ath very good cleinias and now let us all three consider afurther point 
 cle what is it 
 ath that all the matters which we are now describing are commonlycalled by the general name of unwritten customs and what are termedthe laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature and thereflection which lately arose in our minds that we can neither callthese things laws nor yet leave them unmentioned is justified forthey are the bonds of the whole state and come in between the writtenlaws which are or are hereafter to be laid down they are justancestral customs of great antiquity which if they are rightlyordered and made habitual shield and preserve the previously existingwritten law but if they depart from right and fall into they are like the props of builders which slip away out oftheir place and cause a universal part drags another the fair falls because the old foundations areundermined reflecting upon this cleinias you ought to bind togetherthe new state in every possible way omitting nothing whether greator small of what are called laws or manners or pursuits for by thesemeans a city is bound together and all these things are onlylasting when they depend upon one another and therefore we must notwonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages comepouring in and lengthening out our laws 
 cle very true we are disposed to agree with you 
 ath up to the age of three years whether of boy or girl if aperson strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes thema principal aim he will do much for the advantage of the youngcreatures but at three four five and even six years the childishnature will require sports now is the time to get rid of inhim punishing him but not so as to disgrace him we were sayingabout slaves that we ought neither to add insult to punishment soas to anger them nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they and a like rule is to be observed in the case of children at that age have certain natural modes ofamusement which they find out for themselves when they meet and allthe children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meetat the temples the villages the several families of a village unitingon one spot the nurses are to see that the children behave properlyand themselves and all their companies are to be underthe control of twelve matrons one for each company who areannually selected to inspect them from the women previously the women who have authority over marriage whom the guardiansof the law appoint these matrons shall be chosen by the women whohave authority over marriage one out of each tribe all are to beof the same age and let each of them as soon as she is office and go to the temples every day punishing alloffenders male or female who are slaves or strangers by the help ofsome of the public slaves but if any citizen disputes the her bring him before the wardens of the city or if there be nodispute let her punish him herself after the age of six years thetime has arrived for the separation of the boys live withboys and girls in like manner with girls now they must begin boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of thebow the javelin and sling and the girls too if they do not any rate until they know how to manage these weapons andespecially how to handle heavy arms for i may note that the practicewhich now prevails is almost universally misunderstood 
 cle in what respect 
 ath in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by naturedifferently suited for our various uses of them whereas no differenceis found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs but in the use ofthe hands we are as it were maimed by the folly of nurses andmothers for although our several limbs are by nature balanced wecreate a difference in them by bad habit in some cases this is ofno consequence as for example when we hold the lyre in the lefthand and the plectrum in the right but it is downright folly to makethe same distinction in other cases the custom of the scythiansproves our error for they not only hold the bow from them with theleft hand and draw the arrow to them with their right but useeither hand for both purposes and there are many similar examplesin charioteering and other things from which we may learn thatthose who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary tonature in the case of the plectrum which is of horn only andsimilar instruments as i was saying it is of no consequence butmakes a great difference and may be of very great importance to thewarrior who has to use iron weapons bows and javelins and thelike above all when in heavy armour he has to fight against heavyarmour and there is a very great difference between one who haslearnt and one who has not and between one who has been trained ingymnastic exercises and one who has not been for as he who isperfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling is notunable to fight from his left side and does not limp and draggle inconfusion when his opponent makes him change his position so fighting and in all other things if i am not like who has these double powers of attack and defenceought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained ifhe can help and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus heought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts magistrates male and female should see to all these women superintending the nursing and amusements of the the men superintending their education that all of them boys andgirls alike may be sound hand and foot and may not if they canhelp spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits 
 education has two of gymnastic which is concerned withthe body and the other of music which is designed for theimprovement of the soul and gymnastic has also two wrestling and one sort of dancing imitates musical aims at preserving dignity and freedom the other aims atproducing health agility and beauty in the limbs and parts of thebody giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them aharmonious motion being diffused everywhere and forming a suitableaccompaniment to the dance as regards wrestling the tricks whichantaeus and cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit ofcompetition or the tricks of boxing which epeius or amycusinvented are useless and unsuitable for war and do not deserve tohave much said about them but the art of wrestling erect andkeeping free the neck and hands and sides working with energy andconstancy with a composed strength and for the sake are always useful and are not to be neglected but to beenjoined alike on masters and scholars when we reach that part oflegislation and we will desire the one to give their instructionsfreely and the others to receive them thankfully nor again must weomit suitable imitations of war in our choruses here in crete youhave the armed dances if the curetes and the lacedaemonians havethose of the dioscuri and our virgin lady delighting in theamusement of the dance thought it not fit to amuse herself with emptyhands she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour and in thisattire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in everyrespect imitate her esteeming highly the favour of the with a view to the necessities of war and to festiveoccasions it will be right also for the boys until such time as theygo out to war to make processions and supplications to all the godsin goodly array armed and on horseback in dances and or slow offering up prayers to the gods and to the sons of also engaging in contests and preludes of contests if at these objects for these sorts of exercises and no others areuseful both in peace and war and are beneficial alike to states andto private houses but other labours and sports and exercises of thebody are unworthy of freemen o megillus and cleinias 
 i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i saidat first ought to be described if you know of any better will youcommunicate your thoughts 
 cle it is not easy stranger to put aside these principles ofgymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones 
 ath now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts ofthe muses and of apollo before we fancied that we had said that gymnastic alone remained but now we see clearly whatpoints have been omitted and should be first proclaimed of let us proceed to speak 
 cle by all means 
 ath let me tell you once you have heard me say thesame before that caution must be always exercised both by the speakerand by the hearer about anything that is very singular and my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell andyet i have a confidence which makes me go on 
 cle what have you to say stranger 
 ath i say that in states generally no one has observed that theplays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or wantof permanence in legislation for when plays are ordered with a viewto children having the same plays and amusing themselves after thesame manner and finding delight in the same playthings the moresolemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain if sports are disturbed and innovations are made in them andthey constantly change and the young never speak of their havingthe same likings or the same established notions of good and badtaste either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress but hewho devises something new and out of the way in figures and coloursand the like is held in special honour we may truly say that nogreater evil can happen in a state for he who changes the sports issecretly changing the manners of the young and making the old to bedishonoured among them and the new to be honoured and i affirm thatthere is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than sayingor thinking thus will you hear me tell how great i deem the evil tobe 
 cle you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states 
 ath exactly 
 cle if you are speaking of that you will find in us hearers whoare disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but mostfavourably 
 ath i should expect so 
 cle proceed 
 ath well then let us give all the greater heed to one the argument affirms that any change whatever except fromevil is the most dangerous of all things this is true in the caseof the seasons and of the winds in the management of our bodies andthe habits of our of all things except as i said the bad he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomedto eat any sort of meat or drink any drink or to do any work whichthey can get may see that they are at first disordered by them butafterwards as time goes on their bodies grow adapted to them andthey learn to know and like variety and have good health andenjoyment of life and if ever afterwards they are confined again to asuperior diet at first they are troubled with disorders and withdifficulty become habituated to their new food a similar principle wemay imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures oftheir souls for when they have been brought up in certain laws whichby some divine providence have remained unchanged during long ages sothat no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having beenotherwise than they are then every one is afraid and ashamed tochange that which is established the legislator must somehow find away of implanting this reverence for antiquity and i would proposethe following are apt to fancy as i was saying when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays notseeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out ofthe change and they readily comply with the wishes instead ofdeterring him not considering that these children who makeinnovations in their games when they grow up to be men will bedifferent from the last generation of children and beingdifferent will desire a different sort of life and under theinfluence of this desire will want other institutions and laws and noone of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called thegreatest of evils to states changes in bodily fashions are no suchserious evils but frequent changes in the praise and censure ofmanners are the greatest of evils and require the utmost prevision 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and now do we still hold to our former assertion thatrhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evilcharacters in men what say you 
 cle that is the only doctrine which we can admit 
 ath must we not then try in every possible way to prevent ouryouth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures 
 cle most true 
 ath can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this objectthan that of the egyptians 
 cle what is their method 
 ath to consecrate every sort of dance or melody first we shouldordain for the year what they ought to be andat what time and in honour of what gods sons of gods and heroesthey ought to be celebrated and in the next place what hymnsought to be sung at the several sacrifices and with what dances theparticular festival is to be honoured this has to be arranged atfirst by certain persons and when arranged the whole assembly ofthe citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the fates andall the other gods and to consecrate the several odes to gods andheroes and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any oneof the gods the priests and priestesses acting in concert with theguardians of the law shall with the sanction of religion and thelaw exclude him and he who is excluded if he do not submit shallbe liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety broughtagainst him by any one who likes 
 cle very good 
 ath in the consideration of this subject let us remember what isdue to ourselves 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i mean that any young man and much more any old one when hesees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed does not at once runto embrace the paradox but he stands considering like a person whois at a place where three paths meet and does not very well knowhis may be alone or he may be walking with others and hewill say to himself and them which is the way and will not moveforward until he is satisfied that he is going right and this is whatwe must do in the present strange discussion on thesubject of law has arisen which requires the utmost we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such greatmatters or be confident that we can say anything certain all in amoment 
 cle most true 
 ath then we will allow time for reflection and decide when we havegiven the subject sufficient consideration but that we may not behindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws let usproceed to the conclusion of them in due order for very god will the exposition of them when completed may throw lighton our present perplexity 
 cle excellent stranger let us do as you propose 
 ath let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are ourlaws nomoi and this latter being the name which the ancients gaveto lyric songs they probably would not have very much objected to ourproposed application of the word some one either asleep or have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature and let our decreebe as one in singing or dancing shall offend againstpublic and consecrated models and the general fashion among theyouth any more than he would offend against any other law and he whoobserves this law shall be blameless but he who is disobedient asi was saying shall be punished by the guardians of the laws and bythe priests and priestesses suppose that we imagine this to be ourlaw 
 cle very good 
 ath can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule let us think that our only safety will be in first framing certain modelsfor composers one of these models shall be as when asacrifice is going on and the victims are being burnt according i say any one who may be a son or brother standing byanother at the altar and over the victims horribly blasphemes willnot his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings inthe mind of his father and of his other kinsmen 
 cle of course 
 ath and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities amagistrate offers a public sacrifice and there come in not one butmany choruses who take up a position a little way from the altar andfrom time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies onthe sacred rites exciting the souls of the audience with words andrhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear and he who at themoment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weepmost carries away the palm of victory now ought we not to forbidsuch strains as these and if ever our citizens must hear suchlamentations then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there bechoruses of foreign and hired minstrels like those hirelings whoaccompany the departed at funerals with barbarous carian is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have suchstrains at all and let the apparel of the singers be not circletsand ornaments of gold but the reverse enough of all this i willsimply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of ourprinciples of song 
 cle what 
 ath that we should avoid every word of evil omen let that kindof song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in ourstate i need hardly ask again but shall assume that you agree withme 
 cle by all means that law is approved by the suffrages of us all 
 ath but what shall be our next musical law or type ought notprayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice 
 cle certainly 
 ath and our third law if i am not mistaken will be to theeffect that our poets understanding prayers to be requests which wemake to the gods will take especial heed that they do not bymistake ask for evil instead of good to make such a prayer wouldsurely be too ridiculous 
 cle very true 
 ath were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silveror golden plutus should dwell in our state 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and what has it been the object of our argument to show did wenot imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowingwhat is good or evil and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer insong or words he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of whatis good in matters of the highest import than which as i was can be few greater mistakes shall we then propose as one of ourlaws and models relating to the muses 
 cle you explain the law more precisely 
 ath shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothingcontrary to the ideas of the lawful or just or beautiful or are allowed in the state nor shall he be permitted tocommunicate his compositions to any private individuals until heshall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of thelaw and they are satisfied with them as to the persons whom weappoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director ofeducation these have been already indicated once more then as ihave asked more than once shall this be our third law and do you say 
 cle let it be so by all means 
 ath then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the with prayers and after the gods prayers and praisesshould be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes suitable totheir several characters 
 cle certainly 
 ath in the next place there will be no objection to a law thatcitizens who are departed and have done good and energetic with their souls or with their bodies and have been obedientto the laws should receive eulogies this will be very fitting 
 cle quite true 
 ath but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are stillalive is not safe a man should run his course and make a fairending and then we will praise him and let praise be given equallyto women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue theorder of songs and dances shall be as are manyancient musical compositions and dances which are excellent andfrom these the city may freely select what is proper andsuitable and they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years ofage who shall make the selection and any of the old poems which theydeem sufficient they shall include any that are deficient oraltogether unsuitable they shall either utterly throw aside orexamine and amend taking into their counsel poets and making use of their poetical genius but explaining to them thewishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate and all choral strains according to the mind of the not allowing them to indulge except in some few matters theirindividual pleasures and fancies now the irregular strain of music isalways made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and rejecting the honeyed however that we mean wholly toexclude pleasure which is the characteristic of all music and if aman be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion and maturityin the use of the orderly and severe music when he hears the oppositehe detests it and calls it illiberal but if trained in the sweet andvulgar music he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing so i was saying before while he who hears them gains no more pleasurefrom the one than from the other the one has the advantage ofmaking those who are trained in it better men whereas the other makesthem worse 
 cle very true 
 ath again we must distinguish and determine on some generalprinciple what songs are suitable to women and what to men andmust assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms it isshocking for a whole harmony to be inharmonical or for a rhythm to beunrhythmical and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate tothem and therefore the legislator must assign to these also theirforms now both sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessitybelong to them and those of women are clearly enough indicated bytheir natural difference the grand and that which tends tocourage may be fairly called manly but that which inclines tomoderation and temperance may be declared both in law and in ordinaryspeech to be the more womanly quality this then will be the generalorder of them 
 let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them andthe persons to whom and the time when they are severally to beimparted as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel andthus as it were draws the ship in outline so do i seek todistinguish the patterns of life and lay down their keels accordingto the nature of different souls seeking truly to consider bywhat means and in what ways we may go through the voyage of lifebest now human affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest andyet we must be in earnest about sad necessity constrains having got thus far there will be a fitness in our completing thematter if we can only find some suitable method of doing so but whatdo i mean some one may ask this very question and quite 
 cle certainly 
 ath i say that about serious matters a man should be serious andabout a matter which is not serious he should not be serious andthat god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious andblessed endeavours for man as i said before is made to be theplaything of god and this truly considered is the best of also every man and woman should walk seriously and passlife in the noblest of pastimes and be of another mind from what theyare at present 
 cle in what respect 
 ath at present they think that their serious suits should be forthe sake of their sports for they deem war a serious must be managed well for the sake of peace but the truth there neither is nor has been nor ever will be eitheramusement or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in is nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of ourpursuits and therefore as we say every one of us should live thelife of peace as long and as well as he can and what is the right wayof living are we to live in sports always if so in what kind ofsports we ought to live sacrificing and singing and dancing andthen a man will be able to propitiate the gods and to defendhimself against his enemies and conquer them in battle the type ofsong or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described andthe paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him hewill go forward in the spirit of the poet 
 telemachus some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart butother things god will suggest for i deem that thou wast not broughtup without the will of the this ought to be the view of our alumni they ought to thinkthat what has been said is enough for them and that any otherthings their genius and god will suggest to will tell themto whom and when and to what gods severally they are to sacrificeand perform dances and how they may propitiate the deities andlive according to the appointment of nature being for the most partpuppets but having some little share of reality 
 megillus you have a low opinion of mankind stranger 
 ath nay megillus be not amazed but forgive was comparingthem with the gods and under that feeling i spoke let us grant ifyou wish that the human race is not to be despised but is worthyof some consideration 
 next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to are to be in three places in the midst of the city andoutside the city and in the surrounding country also in three shall be schools for horse exercise and large groundsarranged with a view to archery and the throwing of missiles at whichyoung men may learn and practise of these mention has already beenmade and if the mention be not sufficiently explicit let us of them and embody them in laws in these several schoolslet there be dwellings for teachers who shall be brought from foreignparts by pay and let them teach those who attend the schools theart of war and the art of music and the children shall come notonly if their parents please but if they do not please there shallbe compulsory education as the saying is of all and sundry as farthis is possible and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging to thestate rather than to their parents my law would apply to females aswell as males they shall both go through the same exercises i assertwithout fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are assuitable to women as to men of the truth of this i am persuadedfrom ancient tradition and at the present day there are said to becountless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black sauromatides who not only ride on horseback like men but haveenjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally withthe men and i further affirm that if these things are can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our owncountry of men and women not following the same pursuits with alltheir strength and with one mind for thus the state instead of beinga whole is reduced to a half but has the same imposts to pay and thesame toils to undergo and what can be a greater mistake for anylegislator to make than this 
 cle very true yet much of what has been asserted by us strangeris contrary to the custom of states still in saying that thediscourse should be allowed to proceed and that when the discussionis completed we should choose what seems best you spoke veryproperly and i now feel compunction for what i have said tell what you would next wish to say 
 ath i should wish to say cleinias as i said before that if thepossibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact thenthere might be an objection to the argument but the fact being as ihave said he who rejects the law must find some other ground ofobjection and failing this our exhortation will still hold will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possiblein education and in other ways with men for women do notshare in their whole life with men then they must have some otherorder of life 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferableto this community which we are now assigning to them shall weprefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races whouse their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of theirherds and flocks and to minister to them like shall wedo as we and people in our part of the world together asthe phrase is all our goods and chattels into one dwelling weentrust them to our women who are the stewards of them and whoalso preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning or shallwe take a middle course in lacedaemon the girlsshare in gymnastic and music while the women no longeremployed in spinning wool are hard at work weaving the web of will be no cheap or mean employment and in the duty ofserving and taking care of the household and bringing up which they will observe a sort of mean not participating in thetoils of war and if there were any necessity that they should fightfor their city and families unlike the amazons they would beunable to take part in archery or any other skilled use of could they after the example of the goddess carry shield orspear or stand up nobly for their country when it was beingdestroyed and strike terror into their enemies if only becausethey were seen in regular order living as they do they would neverdare at all to imitate the sauromatides who when compared withordinary women would appear to be like men let him who your legislators but i must say what i think the legislatorought to be whole and perfect and not half a man only he ought notto let the female sex live softly and waste money and have no order oflife while he takes the utmost care of the male sex and leaveshalf of life only blest with happiness when he might have made thewhole state happy 
 meg what shall we do cleinias shall we allow a stranger to rundown sparta in this fashion 
 cle yes for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let himgo on until we have perfected the work of legislation 
 meg very true 
 ath then now i may proceed 
 cle by all means 
 ath what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposedto have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation andwho have entrusted the practice of the arts to others and whosehusbandry committed to slaves paying a part of the produce bringsthem a return sufficient for men living temperately who common tables in which the men are placed apart and near themare the common tables of their families of their daughters andmothers which day by day the officers male and female are shall see to the behaviour of the company and so dismissthem after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shallhonour with libations those gods to whom that day and night arededicated and then go home to men whose lives are thus ordered isthere no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting butshall each one of them live fattening like a beast such a life isneither just nor honourable nor can he who lives it fail of meetinghis due and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he shouldbe torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worndown by brave deeds and toil these regulations if we duly considerthem will never be exactly carried into execution under presentcircumstances nor as long as women and children and houses and allother things are the private property of individuals but if we canattain the form of polity we shall be very well to men living under this second polity there remains a work tobe accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant but isthe greatest of all works and ordained by the appointment ofrighteous law for the life which may be truly said to be concernedwith the virtue of body and soul is twice or more than twice as fullof toil and trouble as the pursuit after pythian and olympicvictories which debars a man from every employment of life for thereought to be no interfering with the greater work of providingthe necessary exercise and nourishment for the body and instructionand education for the soul night and day are not long enough forthe accomplishment of their perfection and consummation and thereforeto this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which they willspend their time during the whole course of the day from morning tillevening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise theremay seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutelythe numberless details of the management of the house includingsuch particulars as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to beperpetual watchmen of the whole city for that any citizen shouldcontinue during the whole of any night in sleep instead of being seenby all his servants always the first to awake and get the regulation is to be called a law or only a be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman also that themistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead ofherself first awakening them is what the slaves male and female andthe and if that were possible everybody and everythingin the house should regard as base if they rise early they may allof them do much of their public and of their household business asmagistrates in the city and masters and mistresses in their privatehouses before the sun is up much sleep is not required by for our souls or bodies or for the actions which they no one who is asleep is good for anything any more than if hewere dead but he of us who has the most regard for life and reasonkeeps awake as long he can reserving only so much time for sleep asis expedient for health and much sleep is not required if thehabit of moderation be once rightly formed magistrates in stateswho keep awake at night are terrible to the bad whether enemies orcitizens and are honoured and reverenced by the just and are useful to themselves and to the whole state 
 a night which is passed in such a manner in addition to all advantages infuses a sort of courage into the mindsof the citizens when the day breaks the time has arrived for youthto go to their schoolmasters now neither sheep nor any otheranimals can live without a shepherd nor can children be leftwithout tutors or slaves without masters and of all animals theboy is the most unmanageable inasmuch as he has the fountain ofreason in him not yet regulated he is the most and insubordinate of animals wherefore he must be boundwith many bridles in the first place when he gets away frommothers and nurses he must be under the management of tutors onaccount of his childishness and foolishness then again being afreeman he must be controlled by teachers no matter what they by studies but he is also a slave and in that regard any freemanwho comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and hisinstructor if any of them does anything wrong and he who comesacross him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which hedeserves shall incur the greatest disgrace and let the guardian ofthe law who is the director of education see to him who coming inthe way of the offences which we have mentioned does not chastisethem when he ought or chastises them in a way which he ought not lethim keep a sharp and take especial care of the training ofour children directing their natures and always turning them to goodaccording to the law 
 but how can our law sufficiently train the director of for as yet all has been imperfect and nothing has beensaid either clear or satisfactory now as far as possible the lawought to leave nothing to him but to explain everything that hemay be an interpreter and tutor to others about dances and musicand choral strains i have already spoken both to the character of theselection of them and the manner in which they are to be amendedand consecrated but we have not as yet spoken o illustrious guardianof education of the manner in which your pupils are to use thosestrains which are written in prose although you have been informedwhat martial strains they are to learn and practise what relates inthe first place to the learning of letters and secondly to the also to calculation which as we were saying is needful for themall to learn and any other things which are required with a view towar and the management of house and city and looking to the sameobject what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly and sun and moon and the various regulations about thesematters which are necessary for the whole am speaking of thearrangements of days in periods of months and of months in are to be observed in order that seasons and sacrifices andfestivals may have their regular and natural order and keep thecity alive and awake the gods receiving the honours due to men having a better understanding about them all these my friend have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by thelegislator attend then to what i am now going to weretelling you in the first place that you were not sufficientlyinformed about letters and the objection was to this were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectablecitizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning ornot apply himself at all and the same remark holds good of thestudy of the lyre but now we say that he ought to attend to them afair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is threeyears the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin tohandle the lyre and he may continue at this for another threeyears neither more nor less and whether his father or himself likeor dislike the study he is not to be allowed to spend more or lesstime in learning music than the law allows and let him who disobeysthe law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shallhereafter speak hear however first of all what the young oughtto learn in the early years of life and what their instructorsought to teach them they ought to be occupied with their lettersuntil they are to read and write but the acquisition of perfectbeauty or quickness in writinig if nature has not stimulated themto acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years theyshould let alone and as to the learning of compositions committedto writing which are not set to the lyre whether metrical orwithout rhythmical divisions compositions in prose as they aretermed having no rhythm or how dangerous are thewritings handed down to us by many writers of this will youdo with them o most excellent guardians of the law or how can thelawgiver rightly direct you about them i believe that he will be ingreat difficulty 
 cle what troubles you stranger and why are you so perplexed inyour mind 
 ath you naturally ask cleinias and to you and megillus who aremy partners in the work of legislation i must state the moredifficult as well as the easier parts of the task 
 cle to what do you refer in this instance 
 ath i will tell you there is a difficulty in opposing many myriadsof mouths 
 cle well and have we not already opposed the popular voice in manyimportant enactments 
 ath that is quite true and you mean to imply that the roadwhich we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to asmany others or if not to as many at any rate to persons not inferiorto the others and in company with them you bid me at whateverrisk to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out ofour present discourse and to be of good cheer and not to faint 
 cle certainly 
 ath and i do not faint i say indeed that we have a great manypoets writing in hexameter trimeter and all sorts of are serious others who aim only at raising a allmankind declare that the youth who are rightly educated should bebrought up in them and saturated with them some insist that theyshould be constantly hearing them read aloud and always learningthem so as to get by heart entire poets while others select choicepassages and long speeches and make compendiums of them sayingthat these ought to be committed to memory if a man is to be madegood and wise by experience and learning of many things and youwant me now to tell them plainly in what they are right and in whatthey are wrong 
 cle yes i do ath but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them i amof opinion and if i am not mistaken there is a general every one of these poets has said many things well and manythings the reverse of well and if this be true then i do affirm thatmuch learning is dangerous to youth 
 cle how would you advise the guardian of the law to act 
 ath in what respect 
 cle i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide inpermitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learnothers do not shrink from answering 
 ath my good cleinias i rather think that i am fortunate 
 cle how so 
 ath i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern for when iconsider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now andwhich as i believe have been inspired by heaven they appear to meto be quite like a poem when i reflected upon all these words ofours i naturally felt pleasure for of all the discourses which ihave ever learnt or heard either in poetry or prose this seemed tome to be the justest and most suitable for young men to hear icannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian ofthe law who is also the director of education can have he cannot dobetter than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and anywhich are of a like nature if he should happen to find them eitherin poetry or prose or if he come across unwritten discourses akinto ours he should certainly preserve them and commit them towriting and first of all he shall constrain the teachers themselvesto learn and approve them and any of them who will not shall notbe employed by him but those whom he finds agreeing in hisjudgment he shall make use of and shall commit to them theinstruction and education of youth and here and on this wise let myfanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end 
 cle i do not think stranger that we have wandered out of theproposed limits of the argument but whether we are right or not inour whole conception i cannot be very certain 
 ath the truth cleinias may be expected to become clearer when aswe have often said we arrive at the end of the whole discussion aboutlaws 
 cle yes 
 ath and now that we have done with the teacher of letters theteacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us 
 cle certainly 
 ath i think that we have only to recollect our previousdiscussions and we shall be able to give suitable regulationstouching all this part of instruction and education to the teachers ofthe lyre 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath we were saying if i remember rightly that choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick intheir perceptions of rhythm and musical composition that they mightbe able to distinguish good and bad imitation that is to say theimitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence of the one and displaying the other in hymns and the souls of youth and inviting them to follow and attainvirtue by the way of imitation 
 cle very true 
 ath and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to usethe sounds of the lyre because its notes are pure the player whoteaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison butcomplexity and variation of notes when the strings give one soundand the poet or composer of the melody gives when theymake concords and harmonies in which lesser and greater and quick or high and low notes are again whenthey make complex variations of rhythms which they adapt to the notesof the that sort of thing is not suited to those who haveto acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three opposite principles are confusing and create a difficulty inlearning and our young men should learn quickly and their merenecessary acquirements are not few or trifling as will be shown indue course let the director of education attend to the principlesconcerning music which we are laying down as to the songs and wordsthemselves which the masters of choruses are to teach and thecharacter of them they have been already described by us and are thesame which when consecrated and adapted to the different said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocentamusement 
 cle that again is true 
 ath then let him who has been elected a director of music receivethese rules from us as containing the very truth and may he prosperin his office let us now proceed to lay down other rules inaddition to the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise ingeneral having said what remained to be said about the teaching ofmusic let us speak in like manner about gymnastic for boys and girlsought to learn to dance and practise gymnastic theynot 
 cle yes 
 ath then the boys ought to have dancing masters and the girlsdancing mistresses to exercise them 
 cle very good 
 ath then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern inthe business the superintendent of youth the director ofeducation he will have plenty to do if he is to have the chargeof music and gymnastic 
 cle but how will old man be able to attend to such great charges 
 ath o my friend there will be no difficulty for the law hasalready given and will give him permission to select as his assistantsin this charge any citizens male or female whom he desires and hewill know whom he ought to choose and will be anxious not to make amistake from a due sense of responsibility and from aconsciousness of the importance of his office and also because hewill consider that if young men have been and are well brought all things go swimmingly but if not it is not meet to do we say what will follow lest the regarders of omens shouldtake alarm about our infant state many things have been said by usabout dancing and about gymnastic movements in general for we includeunder gymnastics all military exercises such as archery and allhurling of weapons and the use of the light shield and allfighting with heavy arms and military evolutions and movements ofarmies and encampings and all that relates to horsemanship of allthese things there ought to be public teachers receiving pay from thestate and their pupils should be the men and boys in the state andalso the girls and women who are to know all these things while theyare yet girls they should have practised dancing in arms and the wholeart of women they should apply themselves toevolutions and tactics and the mode of grounding and taking uparms if for no other reason yet in case the whole military forceshould have to leave the city and carry on operations of waroutside that those who will have to guard the young and the rest ofthe city may be equal to the task and on the other hand whenenemies whether barbarian or hellenic come from without withmighty force and make a violent assault upon them and thus compelthem to fight for the possession of the city which is far frombeing an impossibility great would be the disgrace to the state ifthe women had been so miserably trained that they could not fightfor their young as birds will against any creature however die or undergo any danger but must instantly rush to thetemples and crowd at the altars and shrines and bring upon humannature the reproach that of all animals man is the most cowardly 
 cle such a want of education stranger is certainly an unseemlything to happen in a state as well as a great misfortune 
 ath suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying thatwomen ought not to neglect military matters but that all and female alike shall attend to them 
 cle i quite agree 
 ath of wrestling we have spoken in part but of what i shouldcall the most important part we have not spoken and cannot easilyspeak without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in wordwhat we mean when word and action combine and not till then weshall explain clearly what has been said pointing out that of allmovements wrestling is most akin to the military art and is to bepursued for the sake of this and not this for the sake of wrestling 
 cle excellent 
 ath enough of wrestling we will now proceed to speak of othermovements of the body such motion may be in general called is of two kinds one of nobler figures imitating thehonourable the other of the more ignoble figures imitating the of both these there are two further subdivisions of theserious one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart the otherexhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modestpleasures and may be truly called and is the dance of peace thewarrior dance is different from the peaceful one and may be rightlytermed pyrrhic this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missilesby dropping or giving way or springing aside or rising up or fallingdown also the opposite postures which are those of action as forexample the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins andof all sorts of blows and when the imitation is of brave bodies andsouls and the action is direct and muscular giving for the most parta straight movement to the limbs of the i say is thetrue sort but the opposite is not right in the dance of peace whatwe have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally andgracefully and after the manner of men who duly conform to the before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing about which thereis any doubt from that about which there is no doubt which is thedoubtful kind and how are the two to be distinguished there aredances of the bacchic sort both those in which as they say theyimitate drunken men and which are named after the nymphs and silenuses and satyrs and also those in which purifications aremade or mysteries this sort of dancing cannot berightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character orindeed as having any meaning whatever and may i think be mosttruly described as distinct from the warlike dance and distinctfrom the peaceful and not suited for a city at all there let it so leaving it to lie we will proceed to the dances of war andpeace for with these we are undoubtedly concerned now theunwarlike muse which honours in dance the gods and the sons of thegods is entirely associated with the consciousness of class may be subdivided into two lesser classes of which oneis expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good andhas greater pleasures the other expressive of preservation andincrease of former good in which the pleasure is less these cases every man when the pleasure is greater moves hisbody more and less when the pleasure is less and again if he bemore orderly and has learned courage from discipline he waves if he be a coward and has no training or he makesgreater and more violent movements and in general when he is speakingor singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still and soout of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing hasarisen and in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in anorderly another in a disorderly manner and as the ancients may beobserved to have given many names which are according to nature anddeserving of praise so there is an excellent one which they havegiven to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity aremoderate in their giver of names whoever he to them a very true and poetical and rational name when hecalled them emmeleiai or dances of order thus establishing two kindsof dances of the nobler sort the dance of war which he called thepyrrhic and the dance of peace which he called emmeleia or the danceof order giving to each their appropriate and becoming name thesethings the legislator should indicate in general outline and theguardian of the law should enquire into them and search them dancing with music and assigning to the several sacrificialfeasts that which is suitable to them and when he has consecrated allof them in due order he shall for the future change of dance or song thenceforward the city and the citizensshall continue to have the same pleasures themselves being as faras possible alike and shall live well and happily 
 i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodiesand generous souls but it is necessary also to consider and knowuncomely persons and thoughts and those which are intended to producelaughter in comedy and have a comic character in respect of and dance and of the imitations which these afford for seriousthings cannot be understood without laughable things nor opposites atall without opposites if a man is really to have intelligence ofeither but he can not carry out both in action if he is to haveany degree of virtue and for this very reason he should learn themboth in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything whichis ridiculous and out of should command slaves and hiredstrangers to imitate such things but he should never take any seriousinterest in them himself nor should any freeman or freewoman bediscovered taking pains to learn them and there should always be someelement of novelty in the imitation let these then be laid down bothin law and in our discourse as the regulations of laughableamusements which are generally called comedy and if any of theserious poets as they are termed who write tragedy come to us strangers may we go to your city and country or may we shall we bring with us our is your will about shall we answer the divine men i think that ouranswer should be as of strangers we will say to also according to our ability are tragic poets and our tragedyis the best and noblest for our whole state is an imitation of thebest and noblest life which we affirm to be indeed the very truthof tragedy you are poets and we are poets both makers of the samestrains rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas which truelaw can alone perfect as our hope is do not then suppose that weshall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora orintroduce the fair voices of your actors speaking above our permit you to harangue our women and children and the commonpeople about our institutions in language other than our own andvery often the opposite of our own for a state would be mad whichgave you this licence until the magistrates had determined whetheryour poetry might be recited and was fit for publication or o ye sons and scions of the softer muses first of all showyour songs to the magistrates and let them compare them with our if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus but ifnot then my friends we cannot let these then be the customsordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them and letmatters relating to slaves be separated from those relating tomasters if you do not object 
 cle we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put thematter thus 
 ath there still remain three studies suitable for is one of them the measurement of length surface anddepth is the second and the third has to do with the revolutions ofthe stars in relation to one another not every one has need to toilthrough all these things in a strictly scientific manner but only afew and who they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the will be the proper place not to know what is necessary formankind in general and what is the truth is disgraceful to everyone and yet to enter into these matters minutely is neither easy norat all possible for every one but there is something in them which isnecessary and cannot be set aside and probably he who made theproverb about god originally had this in view when he said even god himself can fight against meant if iam not mistaken divine necessity for as to the human necessitiesof which the many speak when they talk in this manner nothing can bemore ridiculous than such an application of the words 
 cle and what necessities of knowledge are there stranger whichare divine and not human 
 ath i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use norany knowledge at all cannot be a god or or hero to able to take any serious thought or charge of them and very unlikea divine man would he be who is unable to count one two three orto distinguish odd and even numbers or is unable to count at reckon night and day and who is totally unacquainted with therevolution of the sun and moon and the other stars there would begreat folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts ofknowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highestkinds of knowledge but which these are and how many there are ofthem and when they are to be learned and what is to be learnedtogether and what apart and the whole correlation of them must berightly apprehended first and these leading the way we may proceed tothe other parts of knowledge for so necessity grounded in natureconstrains us against which we say that no god contends or ever willcontend 
 cle i think stranger that what you have now said is very true andagreeable to nature 
 ath yes cleinias that is so but it is difficult for thelegislator to begin with these studies at a more convenient time wewill make regulations for them 
 cle you seem stranger to be afraid of our habitual ignorance ofthe subject there is no reason why that should prevent you fromspeaking out 
 ath i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which youallude but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves tothis sort of knowledge and apply themselves badly for entireignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil and is far from beingthe greatest of all too much cleverness and too much with an ill bringing up are far more fatal 
 cle true 
 ath all freemen i conceive should learn as much of these branchesof knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns thealphabet in that country arithmetical games have been invented forthe use of mere children which they learn as a pleasure andamusement they have to distribute apples and garlands using the samenumber sometimes for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number ofpersons and they arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pairtogether by lot or remain over and show how their turns come innatural order another mode of amusing them is to distributevessels sometimes of gold brass silver and the like intermixedwith one another sometimes of one metal only as i was saying theyadapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this waymake more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements andmovements of armies and expeditions in the management of ahousehold they make people more useful to themselves and more wideawake and again in measurements of things which have length andbreadth and depth they free us from that natural ignorance of allthese things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful 
 cle what kind of ignorance do you mean 
 ath o my dear cleinias i like yourself have late in life heardwith amazement of our ignorance in these matters to me we appear tobe more like pigs than men and i am quite ashamed not only ofmyself but of all hellenes 
 cle about what say stranger what you mean 
 ath i will or rather i will show you my meaning by a question anddo you please to answer me you know i suppose what length is 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what breadth is 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and you know that these are two distinct things and that thereis a third thing called depth 
 cle of course 
 ath and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable withthemselves 
 cle yes 
 ath that is to say length is naturally commensurable withlength and breadth with breadth and depth in like manner with depth 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath but if some things are commensurable and others whollyincommensurable and you think that all things are commensurable whatis your position in regard to them 
 cle clearly far from good 
 ath concerning length and breadth when compared with depth orbreadth when and length when compared with one another are not allthe hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one in some way 
 cle quite true 
 ath but if they are absolutely incommensurable and yet all of usregard them as commensurable have we not reason to be ashamed ofour compatriots and might we not say to ye best ofhellenes is not this one of the things of which we were saying thatnot to know them is disgraceful and of which to have a bare knowledgeonly is no great distinction 
 cle certainly 
 ath and there are other things akin to these in which there springup other errors of the same family 
 cle what are they 
 ath the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantitiesin their relation to one another a man who is good for a thingought to be able when he thinks to distinguish them and differentpersons should compete with one another in asking questions whichwill be a fair better and more graceful way of passing their timethan the old game of draughts 
 cle i dare say and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game ofdraughts 
 ath and these as i maintain cleinias are the studies which ouryouth ought to learn for they are innocent and not difficult thelearning of them will be an amusement and they will benefit thestate if anyone is of another mind let him say what he has to say 
 cle certainly 
 ath then if these studies are such as we maintain we will includethem if not they shall be excluded 
 cle assuredly but may we not now stranger prescribe thesestudies as necessary and so fill up the lacunae of our laws 
 ath they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafterredeemed and removed from our state if they do not please either uswho give them or you who accept them 
 cle a fair condition 
 ath next let us see whether we are or are not willing that thestudy of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth 
 cle proceed 
 ath here occurs a strange phenomenon which certainly cannot in anypoint of view be tolerated 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god andthe nature of the universe nor busy ourselves in searching out thecauses of things and that such enquiries are impious whereas thevery opposite is the truth 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical and atvariance with the usual language of age but when any one has any goodand true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in everyway acceptable to god he cannot abstain from expressing it 
 cle your words are reasonable enough but shall we find any good ortrue notion about the stars 
 ath my good friends at this hour all of us hellenes tell i may use such an expression about those great gods the sun andthe moon 
 cle lies of what nature 
 ath we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the samepath and we call them planets or wanderers 
 cle very true stranger and in the course of my life i haveoften myself seen the morning star and the evening star and diversothers not moving in their accustomed course but wandering out oftheir path in all manner of ways and i have seen the sun and moondoing what we all know that they do 
 ath just so megillus and cleinias and i maintain that ourcitizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the godsin heaven so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to themin pious language and not to blaspheme about them 
 cle there you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable andif we are wrong in our mode of speaking now and can be betterinstructed and learn to use better language then i quite agree withyou that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightlyshould be acquired by us and now do you try to explain to us yourwhole meaning and we on our part will endeavour to understand you 
 ath there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning but not avery great one nor will any great length of time be required andof this i am myself a proof for i did not know these things long in the days of my youth and yet i can explain them to you in abrief space of time whereas if they had been difficult i couldcertainly never have explained them all old as i am to old menlike yourselves 
 cle true but what is this study which you describe as wonderfuland fitting for youth to learn but of which we are ignorant tryand explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can 
 ath i will for o my good friends that other doctrine about thewandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not thetruth but the very reverse of the truth each of them moves in thesame in many paths but in one only which is circular andthe varieties are only apparent nor are we right in supposing thatthe swiftest of them is the slowest nor conversely that theslowest is the quickest and if what i say is true only justimagine that we had a similar notion about horses running atolympia or about men who ran in the long course and that weaddressed the swiftest as the slowest and the slowest as the sang the praises of the vanquished as though he were that case our praises would not be true nor very agreeableto the runners though they be but men and now to commit the sameerror about the gods which would have been ludicrous and erroneousin the case of not that ludicrous and erroneous 
 cle worse than ludicrous i should say 
 ath at all events the gods cannot like us to be spreading afalse report of them 
 cle most true if such is the fact 
 ath and if we can show that such is really the fact then all thesematters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidanceof impiety but if we cannot they may be let alone and let this beour decision 
 cle very good 
 ath enough of laws relating to education and learning buthunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention forthe legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goesbeyond mere legislation there is something over and above law whichlies in a region between admonition and law and has several timesoccurred to us in the course of discussion for example in theeducation of very young children there were things as we are not to be defined and to regard them as matters of positivelaw is a great absurdity now our laws and the whole constitutionof our state having been thus delineated the praise of the virtuouscitizen is not complete when he is described as the person whoserves the laws best and obeys them most but the higher form ofpraise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passesthrough life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame thisis the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen andthe true legislator ought not only to write his laws but also tointerweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable anddishonourable and the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthenthese no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned bypunishments i will adduce an example which will clear up mymeaning and will be a sort of witness to my words hunting is of wideextent and has a name under which many things are included for thereis a hunting of creatures in the water and of creatures in the there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds andnot of wild beasts only the hunting after man is also worthy ofconsideration there is the hunting after him in war and there isoften a hunting after him in the way of friendship which is praisedand also blamed and there is thieving and the hunting which ispractised by robbers and that of armies against armies now thelegislator in laying down laws about hunting can neither abstainfrom noting these things nor can he make threatening ordinances whichwill assign rules and penalties about all of them what is he to will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exerciseand pursuits of youth and on the other hand the young man mustlisten obediently neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him and heshould regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions ofthe legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by being premised there will follow next in order moderate praiseand censure of hunting the praise being assigned to that kind whichwill make the souls of young men better and the censure to that whichhas the opposite effect 
 and now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for theirwelfare o friends we will say to them may no desire or love ofhunting in the sea or of angling or of catching the creatures inthe waters ever take possession of you either when you are awakeor when you are asleep by hook or with weels which latter is avery lazy contrivance and let not any desire of catching men and ofpiracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawlesshunters and as to the desire of thieving in town or country may itnever enter into your most passing thoughts nor let the insidiousfancy of catching birds which is hardly worthy of freemen comeinto the head of any youth there remains therefore for our athletesonly the hunting and catching of land animals of which the one sortis called hunting by night in which the hunters sleep in turn and arelazy this is not to be commended any more than that which hasintervals of rest in which the will strength of beasts is subduedby nets and snares and not by the victory of a laborious only the best kind of hunting is allowed at ofquadrupeds which is carried on with horses and dogs and ownpersons and they get the victory over the animals by running themdown and striking them and hurling at them those who have a care ofgodlike manhood taking them with their own hands the praise and blamewhich is assigned to all these things has now been declared and letthe law be as no one hinder these who verily are sacredhunters from following the chase wherever and whither soever theywill but the hunter by night who trusts to his nets and not be allowed to hunt anywhere the fowler in the mountains andwaste places shall be permitted but on cultivated ground and onconsecrated wilds he shall not be permitted and any one who meets himmay stop him as to the hunter in waters he may hunt anywhereexcept in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools providedonly that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices and nowwe may say that all our enactments about education are complete

 book vii 
 
 and now assuming children of both sexes to have been born itwill be proper for us to consider in the next place their nurtureand education this cannot be left altogether unnoticed and yet maybe thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than forlaw in private life there are many little things not alwaysapparent arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires ofindividuals which run counter to the intention of the legislator andmake the characters of the citizens various and is anevil in states for by reason of their smallness and frequentoccurrence there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety inmaking them penal by law and if made penal they are thedestruction of the written law because mankind get the habit offrequently transgressing the law in small matters the result isthat you cannot legislate about them and still less can you besilent i speak somewhat darkly but i shall endeavour also to bringmy wares into the light of day for i acknowledge that at presentthere is a want of clearness in what i am saying 
 cleinias very true 
 athenian stranger am i not right in maintaining that a goodeducation is that which tends most to the improvement of mind andbody 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies arethose which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner 
 cle certainly 
 ath and do we not further observe that the first shoot of everyliving thing is by far the greatest and fullest many will evencontend that a man at does not reach twice the heightwhich he attained at five 
 cle true 
 ath well and is not rapid growth without proper and abundantexercise the source endless evils in the body 
 cle yes 
 ath and the body should have the most exercise when it receivesmost nourishment 
 cle but stranger are we to impose this great amount of exerciseupon infants 
 ath nay rather on the bodies of infants still unborn 
 cle what do you mean my good sir in the process of gestation 
 ath exactly i am not at all surprised that you have never heard ofthis very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little although strange i will endeavour to explain to you 
 cle by all means 
 ath the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you byreason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us atathens not only boys but often older persons are in the habit ofkeeping quails and cocks which they train to fight one another andthey are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir themup to fight with one another are sufficient exercise for in additionto this they carry them about tucked beneath their armpits holdingthe smaller birds in their hands the larger under their arms andgo for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health that is tosay not their own health but the health of the birds wherebythey prove to any intelligent person that all bodies are benefited byshakings and movements when they are moved without weariness whethermotion proceeds from themselves or is caused by a swing or at on horseback or by other bodies in whatever way moving and thatthus gaining the mastery over food and drink they are able toimpart beauty and health and strength but admitting all this whatfollows shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant womanshall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion waxbefore it hardens and after birth swathe the infant for two that we compel nurses under penalty of a legal fine to bealways carrying the children somewhere or other either to thetemples or into the country or to their relations houses untilthey are well able to stand and to take care that their limbs are notdistorted by leaning on them when they are too shouldcontinue to carry them until the infant has completed its thirdyear the nurses should be strong and there should be more than oneof them shall these be our rules and shall we impose a penalty forthe neglect of them no no the penalty of which we were speakingwill fall upon our own heads more than enough 
 cle what penalty 
 ath ridicule and the difficulty of getting the feminine dispositions of the nurses to comply 
 cle then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all 
 ath the reason is that masters and freemen in states when theyhear of it are very likely to arrive at a true conviction thatwithout due regulation of private life in cities stability in thelaying down of laws is hardly to be expected and he who makes thisreflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned them may order his house and state well and be happy 
 cle likely enough 
 ath and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we havedetermined the exercises which are suited to the souls of youngchildren in the same manner in which we have begun to go throughthe rules relating to their bodies 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us assume then as a first principle in relation both tothe body and soul of very young creatures that nursing and movingabout by day and night is good for them all and that the younger theyare the more they will need it infants should live if that werepossible as if they were always rocking at sea this is the lessonwhich we may gather from the experience of nurses and likewise fromthe use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the corybantes forwhen mothers want their restless children to go to sleep they do notemploy rest but on the contrary them in theirarms nor do they give them silence but they sing to them and lapthem in sweet strains and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzyin the same manner by the use of the dance and of music 
 cle well stranger and what is the reason of this 
 ath the reason is obvious 
 cle what 
 ath the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children isan emotion of fear which springs out of an evil habit of the when some one applies external agitation to affections of thissort the motion coming from without gets the better of the terribleand violent internal one and produces a peace and calm in the quiets the restless palpitation of the heart which is a thingmuch to be desired sending the children to sleep and making thebacchantes although they remain awake to dance to the pipe withthe help of the gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices andproducing in them a sound mind which takes the place of their to express what i mean in a word there is a good deal to be saidin favour of this treatment 
 cle certainly 
 ath but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from thesefacts that every soul which from youth upward has been familiarwith fears will be made more liable to fear and every one will allowthat this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and on the other hand the habit of overcoming from our youthupwards the fears and terrors which beset us may be said to be anexercise of courage 
 cle true 
 ath and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in theearliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part ofvirtue in the soul 
 cle quite true 
 ath further a cheerful temper or the reverse may be regardedas having much to do with high spirit on the one hand or withcowardice on the other 
 cle to be sure 
 ath then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent wemay if we please without difficulty implant either character inthe young 
 cle certainly 
 ath there is a common opinion that luxury makes the disposition ofyouth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men meanand abject and haters of their kind and therefore makes themundesirable associates 
 cle but how must the state educate those who do not as yetunderstand the language of the country and are therefore incapable ofappreciating any sort of instruction 
 ath i will tell you animal that is born is wont to uttersome cry and this is especially the case with man and he is alsoaffected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal 
 cle quite true 
 ath do not nurses when they want to know what an infant by these anything is brought to the infant and he issilent then he is supposed to be pleased but when he weeps andcries out then he is not pleased for tears and cries are theinauspicious signs by which children show what they love and hate nowthe time which is thus spent is no less than three years and is avery considerable portion of life to be passed ill or well 
 cle true 
 ath does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to youto be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought tobe 
 cle certainly 
 ath well but if during these three years every possible carewere taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and in general of pain as was possible might we not expect in earlychildhood to make his soul more gentle and cheerful 
 cle to be sure especially if we could procure hima variety of pleasures 
 ath there i can no longer agree cleinias you amaze me to bringhim up in such a way would be his utter ruin for the beginning isalways the most critical part of education let us see whether i amright 
 cle proceed 
 ath the point about which you and i differ is of greatimportance and i hope that you megillus will help to decide betweenus for i maintain that the true life should neither seek forpleasures nor on the other hand entirely avoid pains but shouldembrace the middle state which i just spoke of as gentle andbenign and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspirationrightly ascribe to god now i say he among men too who would bedivine ought to pursue after this mean should not rushheadlong into pleasures for he will not be free from pains norshould we allow any one young or old male or female to be thusgiven any more than ourselves and least of all the in infancy more than at any other time the character isengrained by habit nay more if i were not afraid of appearing to beridiculous i would say that a woman during her year of pregnancyshould of all women be most carefully tended and kept from violent orexcessive pleasures and pains and should at that time cultivategentleness and benevolence and kindness 
 cle you need not ask megillus stranger which of us has mosttruly spoken for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid thelife of unmingled pain or pleasure and pursue always a middle having spoken well may i add that you have been well answered 
 ath very good cleinias and now let us all three consider afurther point 
 cle what is it 
 ath that all the matters which we are now describing are commonlycalled by the general name of unwritten customs and what are termedthe laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature and thereflection which lately arose in our minds that we can neither callthese things laws nor yet leave them unmentioned is justified forthey are the bonds of the whole state and come in between the writtenlaws which are or are hereafter to be laid down they are justancestral customs of great antiquity which if they are rightlyordered and made habitual shield and preserve the previously existingwritten law but if they depart from right and fall into they are like the props of builders which slip away out oftheir place and cause a universal part drags another the fair falls because the old foundations areundermined reflecting upon this cleinias you ought to bind togetherthe new state in every possible way omitting nothing whether greator small of what are called laws or manners or pursuits for by thesemeans a city is bound together and all these things are onlylasting when they depend upon one another and therefore we must notwonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages comepouring in and lengthening out our laws 
 cle very true we are disposed to agree with you 
 ath up to the age of three years whether of boy or girl if aperson strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes thema principal aim he will do much for the advantage of the youngcreatures but at three four five and even six years the childishnature will require sports now is the time to get rid of inhim punishing him but not so as to disgrace him we were sayingabout slaves that we ought neither to add insult to punishment soas to anger them nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they and a like rule is to be observed in the case of children at that age have certain natural modes ofamusement which they find out for themselves when they meet and allthe children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meetat the temples the villages the several families of a village unitingon one spot the nurses are to see that the children behave properlyand themselves and all their companies are to be underthe control of twelve matrons one for each company who areannually selected to inspect them from the women previously the women who have authority over marriage whom the guardiansof the law appoint these matrons shall be chosen by the women whohave authority over marriage one out of each tribe all are to beof the same age and let each of them as soon as she is office and go to the temples every day punishing alloffenders male or female who are slaves or strangers by the help ofsome of the public slaves but if any citizen disputes the her bring him before the wardens of the city or if there be nodispute let her punish him herself after the age of six years thetime has arrived for the separation of the boys live withboys and girls in like manner with girls now they must begin boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of thebow the javelin and sling and the girls too if they do not any rate until they know how to manage these weapons andespecially how to handle heavy arms for i may note that the practicewhich now prevails is almost universally misunderstood 
 cle in what respect 
 ath in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by naturedifferently suited for our various uses of them whereas no differenceis found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs but in the use ofthe hands we are as it were maimed by the folly of nurses andmothers for although our several limbs are by nature balanced wecreate a difference in them by bad habit in some cases this is ofno consequence as for example when we hold the lyre in the lefthand and the plectrum in the right but it is downright folly to makethe same distinction in other cases the custom of the scythiansproves our error for they not only hold the bow from them with theleft hand and draw the arrow to them with their right but useeither hand for both purposes and there are many similar examplesin charioteering and other things from which we may learn thatthose who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary tonature in the case of the plectrum which is of horn only andsimilar instruments as i was saying it is of no consequence butmakes a great difference and may be of very great importance to thewarrior who has to use iron weapons bows and javelins and thelike above all when in heavy armour he has to fight against heavyarmour and there is a very great difference between one who haslearnt and one who has not and between one who has been trained ingymnastic exercises and one who has not been for as he who isperfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling is notunable to fight from his left side and does not limp and draggle inconfusion when his opponent makes him change his position so fighting and in all other things if i am not like who has these double powers of attack and defenceought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained ifhe can help and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus heought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts magistrates male and female should see to all these women superintending the nursing and amusements of the the men superintending their education that all of them boys andgirls alike may be sound hand and foot and may not if they canhelp spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits 
 education has two of gymnastic which is concerned withthe body and the other of music which is designed for theimprovement of the soul and gymnastic has also two wrestling and one sort of dancing imitates musical aims at preserving dignity and freedom the other aims atproducing health agility and beauty in the limbs and parts of thebody giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them aharmonious motion being diffused everywhere and forming a suitableaccompaniment to the dance as regards wrestling the tricks whichantaeus and cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit ofcompetition or the tricks of boxing which epeius or amycusinvented are useless and unsuitable for war and do not deserve tohave much said about them but the art of wrestling erect andkeeping free the neck and hands and sides working with energy andconstancy with a composed strength and for the sake are always useful and are not to be neglected but to beenjoined alike on masters and scholars when we reach that part oflegislation and we will desire the one to give their instructionsfreely and the others to receive them thankfully nor again must weomit suitable imitations of war in our choruses here in crete youhave the armed dances if the curetes and the lacedaemonians havethose of the dioscuri and our virgin lady delighting in theamusement of the dance thought it not fit to amuse herself with emptyhands she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour and in thisattire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in everyrespect imitate her esteeming highly the favour of the with a view to the necessities of war and to festiveoccasions it will be right also for the boys until such time as theygo out to war to make processions and supplications to all the godsin goodly array armed and on horseback in dances and or slow offering up prayers to the gods and to the sons of also engaging in contests and preludes of contests if at these objects for these sorts of exercises and no others areuseful both in peace and war and are beneficial alike to states andto private houses but other labours and sports and exercises of thebody are unworthy of freemen o megillus and cleinias 
 i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i saidat first ought to be described if you know of any better will youcommunicate your thoughts 
 cle it is not easy stranger to put aside these principles ofgymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones 
 ath now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts ofthe muses and of apollo before we fancied that we had said that gymnastic alone remained but now we see clearly whatpoints have been omitted and should be first proclaimed of let us proceed to speak 
 cle by all means 
 ath let me tell you once you have heard me say thesame before that caution must be always exercised both by the speakerand by the hearer about anything that is very singular and my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell andyet i have a confidence which makes me go on 
 cle what have you to say stranger 
 ath i say that in states generally no one has observed that theplays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or wantof permanence in legislation for when plays are ordered with a viewto children having the same plays and amusing themselves after thesame manner and finding delight in the same playthings the moresolemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain if sports are disturbed and innovations are made in them andthey constantly change and the young never speak of their havingthe same likings or the same established notions of good and badtaste either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress but hewho devises something new and out of the way in figures and coloursand the like is held in special honour we may truly say that nogreater evil can happen in a state for he who changes the sports issecretly changing the manners of the young and making the old to bedishonoured among them and the new to be honoured and i affirm thatthere is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than sayingor thinking thus will you hear me tell how great i deem the evil tobe 
 cle you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states 
 ath exactly 
 cle if you are speaking of that you will find in us hearers whoare disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but mostfavourably 
 ath i should expect so 
 cle proceed 
 ath well then let us give all the greater heed to one the argument affirms that any change whatever except fromevil is the most dangerous of all things this is true in the caseof the seasons and of the winds in the management of our bodies andthe habits of our of all things except as i said the bad he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomedto eat any sort of meat or drink any drink or to do any work whichthey can get may see that they are at first disordered by them butafterwards as time goes on their bodies grow adapted to them andthey learn to know and like variety and have good health andenjoyment of life and if ever afterwards they are confined again to asuperior diet at first they are troubled with disorders and withdifficulty become habituated to their new food a similar principle wemay imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures oftheir souls for when they have been brought up in certain laws whichby some divine providence have remained unchanged during long ages sothat no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having beenotherwise than they are then every one is afraid and ashamed tochange that which is established the legislator must somehow find away of implanting this reverence for antiquity and i would proposethe following are apt to fancy as i was saying when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays notseeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out ofthe change and they readily comply with the wishes instead ofdeterring him not considering that these children who makeinnovations in their games when they grow up to be men will bedifferent from the last generation of children and beingdifferent will desire a different sort of life and under theinfluence of this desire will want other institutions and laws and noone of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called thegreatest of evils to states changes in bodily fashions are no suchserious evils but frequent changes in the praise and censure ofmanners are the greatest of evils and require the utmost prevision 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and now do we still hold to our former assertion thatrhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evilcharacters in men what say you 
 cle that is the only doctrine which we can admit 
 ath must we not then try in every possible way to prevent ouryouth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures 
 cle most true 
 ath can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this objectthan that of the egyptians 
 cle what is their method 
 ath to consecrate every sort of dance or melody first we shouldordain for the year what they ought to be andat what time and in honour of what gods sons of gods and heroesthey ought to be celebrated and in the next place what hymnsought to be sung at the several sacrifices and with what dances theparticular festival is to be honoured this has to be arranged atfirst by certain persons and when arranged the whole assembly ofthe citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the fates andall the other gods and to consecrate the several odes to gods andheroes and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any oneof the gods the priests and priestesses acting in concert with theguardians of the law shall with the sanction of religion and thelaw exclude him and he who is excluded if he do not submit shallbe liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety broughtagainst him by any one who likes 
 cle very good 
 ath in the consideration of this subject let us remember what isdue to ourselves 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i mean that any young man and much more any old one when hesees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed does not at once runto embrace the paradox but he stands considering like a person whois at a place where three paths meet and does not very well knowhis may be alone or he may be walking with others and hewill say to himself and them which is the way and will not moveforward until he is satisfied that he is going right and this is whatwe must do in the present strange discussion on thesubject of law has arisen which requires the utmost we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such greatmatters or be confident that we can say anything certain all in amoment 
 cle most true 
 ath then we will allow time for reflection and decide when we havegiven the subject sufficient consideration but that we may not behindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws let usproceed to the conclusion of them in due order for very god will the exposition of them when completed may throw lighton our present perplexity 
 cle excellent stranger let us do as you propose 
 ath let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are ourlaws nomoi and this latter being the name which the ancients gaveto lyric songs they probably would not have very much objected to ourproposed application of the word some one either asleep or have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature and let our decreebe as one in singing or dancing shall offend againstpublic and consecrated models and the general fashion among theyouth any more than he would offend against any other law and he whoobserves this law shall be blameless but he who is disobedient asi was saying shall be punished by the guardians of the laws and bythe priests and priestesses suppose that we imagine this to be ourlaw 
 cle very good 
 ath can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule let us think that our only safety will be in first framing certain modelsfor composers one of these models shall be as when asacrifice is going on and the victims are being burnt according i say any one who may be a son or brother standing byanother at the altar and over the victims horribly blasphemes willnot his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings inthe mind of his father and of his other kinsmen 
 cle of course 
 ath and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities amagistrate offers a public sacrifice and there come in not one butmany choruses who take up a position a little way from the altar andfrom time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies onthe sacred rites exciting the souls of the audience with words andrhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear and he who at themoment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weepmost carries away the palm of victory now ought we not to forbidsuch strains as these and if ever our citizens must hear suchlamentations then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there bechoruses of foreign and hired minstrels like those hirelings whoaccompany the departed at funerals with barbarous carian is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have suchstrains at all and let the apparel of the singers be not circletsand ornaments of gold but the reverse enough of all this i willsimply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of ourprinciples of song 
 cle what 
 ath that we should avoid every word of evil omen let that kindof song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in ourstate i need hardly ask again but shall assume that you agree withme 
 cle by all means that law is approved by the suffrages of us all 
 ath but what shall be our next musical law or type ought notprayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice 
 cle certainly 
 ath and our third law if i am not mistaken will be to theeffect that our poets understanding prayers to be requests which wemake to the gods will take especial heed that they do not bymistake ask for evil instead of good to make such a prayer wouldsurely be too ridiculous 
 cle very true 
 ath were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silveror golden plutus should dwell in our state 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and what has it been the object of our argument to show did wenot imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowingwhat is good or evil and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer insong or words he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of whatis good in matters of the highest import than which as i was can be few greater mistakes shall we then propose as one of ourlaws and models relating to the muses 
 cle you explain the law more precisely 
 ath shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothingcontrary to the ideas of the lawful or just or beautiful or are allowed in the state nor shall he be permitted tocommunicate his compositions to any private individuals until heshall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of thelaw and they are satisfied with them as to the persons whom weappoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director ofeducation these have been already indicated once more then as ihave asked more than once shall this be our third law and do you say 
 cle let it be so by all means 
 ath then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the with prayers and after the gods prayers and praisesshould be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes suitable totheir several characters 
 cle certainly 
 ath in the next place there will be no objection to a law thatcitizens who are departed and have done good and energetic with their souls or with their bodies and have been obedientto the laws should receive eulogies this will be very fitting 
 cle quite true 
 ath but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are stillalive is not safe a man should run his course and make a fairending and then we will praise him and let praise be given equallyto women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue theorder of songs and dances shall be as are manyancient musical compositions and dances which are excellent andfrom these the city may freely select what is proper andsuitable and they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years ofage who shall make the selection and any of the old poems which theydeem sufficient they shall include any that are deficient oraltogether unsuitable they shall either utterly throw aside orexamine and amend taking into their counsel poets and making use of their poetical genius but explaining to them thewishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate and all choral strains according to the mind of the not allowing them to indulge except in some few matters theirindividual pleasures and fancies now the irregular strain of music isalways made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and rejecting the honeyed however that we mean wholly toexclude pleasure which is the characteristic of all music and if aman be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion and maturityin the use of the orderly and severe music when he hears the oppositehe detests it and calls it illiberal but if trained in the sweet andvulgar music he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing so i was saying before while he who hears them gains no more pleasurefrom the one than from the other the one has the advantage ofmaking those who are trained in it better men whereas the other makesthem worse 
 cle very true 
 ath again we must distinguish and determine on some generalprinciple what songs are suitable to women and what to men andmust assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms it isshocking for a whole harmony to be inharmonical or for a rhythm to beunrhythmical and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate tothem and therefore the legislator must assign to these also theirforms now both sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessitybelong to them and those of women are clearly enough indicated bytheir natural difference the grand and that which tends tocourage may be fairly called manly but that which inclines tomoderation and temperance may be declared both in law and in ordinaryspeech to be the more womanly quality this then will be the generalorder of them 
 let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them andthe persons to whom and the time when they are severally to beimparted as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel andthus as it were draws the ship in outline so do i seek todistinguish the patterns of life and lay down their keels accordingto the nature of different souls seeking truly to consider bywhat means and in what ways we may go through the voyage of lifebest now human affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest andyet we must be in earnest about sad necessity constrains having got thus far there will be a fitness in our completing thematter if we can only find some suitable method of doing so but whatdo i mean some one may ask this very question and quite 
 cle certainly 
 ath i say that about serious matters a man should be serious andabout a matter which is not serious he should not be serious andthat god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious andblessed endeavours for man as i said before is made to be theplaything of god and this truly considered is the best of also every man and woman should walk seriously and passlife in the noblest of pastimes and be of another mind from what theyare at present 
 cle in what respect 
 ath at present they think that their serious suits should be forthe sake of their sports for they deem war a serious must be managed well for the sake of peace but the truth there neither is nor has been nor ever will be eitheramusement or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in is nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of ourpursuits and therefore as we say every one of us should live thelife of peace as long and as well as he can and what is the right wayof living are we to live in sports always if so in what kind ofsports we ought to live sacrificing and singing and dancing andthen a man will be able to propitiate the gods and to defendhimself against his enemies and conquer them in battle the type ofsong or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described andthe paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him hewill go forward in the spirit of the poet 
 telemachus some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart butother things god will suggest for i deem that thou wast not broughtup without the will of the this ought to be the view of our alumni they ought to thinkthat what has been said is enough for them and that any otherthings their genius and god will suggest to will tell themto whom and when and to what gods severally they are to sacrificeand perform dances and how they may propitiate the deities andlive according to the appointment of nature being for the most partpuppets but having some little share of reality 
 megillus you have a low opinion of mankind stranger 
 ath nay megillus be not amazed but forgive was comparingthem with the gods and under that feeling i spoke let us grant ifyou wish that the human race is not to be despised but is worthyof some consideration 
 next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to are to be in three places in the midst of the city andoutside the city and in the surrounding country also in three shall be schools for horse exercise and large groundsarranged with a view to archery and the throwing of missiles at whichyoung men may learn and practise of these mention has already beenmade and if the mention be not sufficiently explicit let us of them and embody them in laws in these several schoolslet there be dwellings for teachers who shall be brought from foreignparts by pay and let them teach those who attend the schools theart of war and the art of music and the children shall come notonly if their parents please but if they do not please there shallbe compulsory education as the saying is of all and sundry as farthis is possible and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging to thestate rather than to their parents my law would apply to females aswell as males they shall both go through the same exercises i assertwithout fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are assuitable to women as to men of the truth of this i am persuadedfrom ancient tradition and at the present day there are said to becountless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black sauromatides who not only ride on horseback like men but haveenjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally withthe men and i further affirm that if these things are can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our owncountry of men and women not following the same pursuits with alltheir strength and with one mind for thus the state instead of beinga whole is reduced to a half but has the same imposts to pay and thesame toils to undergo and what can be a greater mistake for anylegislator to make than this 
 cle very true yet much of what has been asserted by us strangeris contrary to the custom of states still in saying that thediscourse should be allowed to proceed and that when the discussionis completed we should choose what seems best you spoke veryproperly and i now feel compunction for what i have said tell what you would next wish to say 
 ath i should wish to say cleinias as i said before that if thepossibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact thenthere might be an objection to the argument but the fact being as ihave said he who rejects the law must find some other ground ofobjection and failing this our exhortation will still hold will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possiblein education and in other ways with men for women do notshare in their whole life with men then they must have some otherorder of life 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferableto this community which we are now assigning to them shall weprefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races whouse their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of theirherds and flocks and to minister to them like shall wedo as we and people in our part of the world together asthe phrase is all our goods and chattels into one dwelling weentrust them to our women who are the stewards of them and whoalso preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning or shallwe take a middle course in lacedaemon the girlsshare in gymnastic and music while the women no longeremployed in spinning wool are hard at work weaving the web of will be no cheap or mean employment and in the duty ofserving and taking care of the household and bringing up which they will observe a sort of mean not participating in thetoils of war and if there were any necessity that they should fightfor their city and families unlike the amazons they would beunable to take part in archery or any other skilled use of could they after the example of the goddess carry shield orspear or stand up nobly for their country when it was beingdestroyed and strike terror into their enemies if only becausethey were seen in regular order living as they do they would neverdare at all to imitate the sauromatides who when compared withordinary women would appear to be like men let him who your legislators but i must say what i think the legislatorought to be whole and perfect and not half a man only he ought notto let the female sex live softly and waste money and have no order oflife while he takes the utmost care of the male sex and leaveshalf of life only blest with happiness when he might have made thewhole state happy 
 meg what shall we do cleinias shall we allow a stranger to rundown sparta in this fashion 
 cle yes for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let himgo on until we have perfected the work of legislation 
 meg very true 
 ath then now i may proceed 
 cle by all means 
 ath what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposedto have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation andwho have entrusted the practice of the arts to others and whosehusbandry committed to slaves paying a part of the produce bringsthem a return sufficient for men living temperately who common tables in which the men are placed apart and near themare the common tables of their families of their daughters andmothers which day by day the officers male and female are shall see to the behaviour of the company and so dismissthem after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shallhonour with libations those gods to whom that day and night arededicated and then go home to men whose lives are thus ordered isthere no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting butshall each one of them live fattening like a beast such a life isneither just nor honourable nor can he who lives it fail of meetinghis due and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he shouldbe torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worndown by brave deeds and toil these regulations if we duly considerthem will never be exactly carried into execution under presentcircumstances nor as long as women and children and houses and allother things are the private property of individuals but if we canattain the form of polity we shall be very well to men living under this second polity there remains a work tobe accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant but isthe greatest of all works and ordained by the appointment ofrighteous law for the life which may be truly said to be concernedwith the virtue of body and soul is twice or more than twice as fullof toil and trouble as the pursuit after pythian and olympicvictories which debars a man from every employment of life for thereought to be no interfering with the greater work of providingthe necessary exercise and nourishment for the body and instructionand education for the soul night and day are not long enough forthe accomplishment of their perfection and consummation and thereforeto this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which they willspend their time during the whole course of the day from morning tillevening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise theremay seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutelythe numberless details of the management of the house includingsuch particulars as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to beperpetual watchmen of the whole city for that any citizen shouldcontinue during the whole of any night in sleep instead of being seenby all his servants always the first to awake and get the regulation is to be called a law or only a be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman also that themistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead ofherself first awakening them is what the slaves male and female andthe and if that were possible everybody and everythingin the house should regard as base if they rise early they may allof them do much of their public and of their household business asmagistrates in the city and masters and mistresses in their privatehouses before the sun is up much sleep is not required by for our souls or bodies or for the actions which they no one who is asleep is good for anything any more than if hewere dead but he of us who has the most regard for life and reasonkeeps awake as long he can reserving only so much time for sleep asis expedient for health and much sleep is not required if thehabit of moderation be once rightly formed magistrates in stateswho keep awake at night are terrible to the bad whether enemies orcitizens and are honoured and reverenced by the just and are useful to themselves and to the whole state 
 a night which is passed in such a manner in addition to all advantages infuses a sort of courage into the mindsof the citizens when the day breaks the time has arrived for youthto go to their schoolmasters now neither sheep nor any otheranimals can live without a shepherd nor can children be leftwithout tutors or slaves without masters and of all animals theboy is the most unmanageable inasmuch as he has the fountain ofreason in him not yet regulated he is the most and insubordinate of animals wherefore he must be boundwith many bridles in the first place when he gets away frommothers and nurses he must be under the management of tutors onaccount of his childishness and foolishness then again being afreeman he must be controlled by teachers no matter what they by studies but he is also a slave and in that regard any freemanwho comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and hisinstructor if any of them does anything wrong and he who comesacross him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which hedeserves shall incur the greatest disgrace and let the guardian ofthe law who is the director of education see to him who coming inthe way of the offences which we have mentioned does not chastisethem when he ought or chastises them in a way which he ought not lethim keep a sharp and take especial care of the training ofour children directing their natures and always turning them to goodaccording to the law 
 but how can our law sufficiently train the director of for as yet all has been imperfect and nothing has beensaid either clear or satisfactory now as far as possible the lawought to leave nothing to him but to explain everything that hemay be an interpreter and tutor to others about dances and musicand choral strains i have already spoken both to the character of theselection of them and the manner in which they are to be amendedand consecrated but we have not as yet spoken o illustrious guardianof education of the manner in which your pupils are to use thosestrains which are written in prose although you have been informedwhat martial strains they are to learn and practise what relates inthe first place to the learning of letters and secondly to the also to calculation which as we were saying is needful for themall to learn and any other things which are required with a view towar and the management of house and city and looking to the sameobject what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly and sun and moon and the various regulations about thesematters which are necessary for the whole am speaking of thearrangements of days in periods of months and of months in are to be observed in order that seasons and sacrifices andfestivals may have their regular and natural order and keep thecity alive and awake the gods receiving the honours due to men having a better understanding about them all these my friend have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by thelegislator attend then to what i am now going to weretelling you in the first place that you were not sufficientlyinformed about letters and the objection was to this were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectablecitizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning ornot apply himself at all and the same remark holds good of thestudy of the lyre but now we say that he ought to attend to them afair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is threeyears the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin tohandle the lyre and he may continue at this for another threeyears neither more nor less and whether his father or himself likeor dislike the study he is not to be allowed to spend more or lesstime in learning music than the law allows and let him who disobeysthe law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shallhereafter speak hear however first of all what the young oughtto learn in the early years of life and what their instructorsought to teach them they ought to be occupied with their lettersuntil they are to read and write but the acquisition of perfectbeauty or quickness in writinig if nature has not stimulated themto acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years theyshould let alone and as to the learning of compositions committedto writing which are not set to the lyre whether metrical orwithout rhythmical divisions compositions in prose as they aretermed having no rhythm or how dangerous are thewritings handed down to us by many writers of this will youdo with them o most excellent guardians of the law or how can thelawgiver rightly direct you about them i believe that he will be ingreat difficulty 
 cle what troubles you stranger and why are you so perplexed inyour mind 
 ath you naturally ask cleinias and to you and megillus who aremy partners in the work of legislation i must state the moredifficult as well as the easier parts of the task 
 cle to what do you refer in this instance 
 ath i will tell you there is a difficulty in opposing many myriadsof mouths 
 cle well and have we not already opposed the popular voice in manyimportant enactments 
 ath that is quite true and you mean to imply that the roadwhich we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to asmany others or if not to as many at any rate to persons not inferiorto the others and in company with them you bid me at whateverrisk to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out ofour present discourse and to be of good cheer and not to faint 
 cle certainly 
 ath and i do not faint i say indeed that we have a great manypoets writing in hexameter trimeter and all sorts of are serious others who aim only at raising a allmankind declare that the youth who are rightly educated should bebrought up in them and saturated with them some insist that theyshould be constantly hearing them read aloud and always learningthem so as to get by heart entire poets while others select choicepassages and long speeches and make compendiums of them sayingthat these ought to be committed to memory if a man is to be madegood and wise by experience and learning of many things and youwant me now to tell them plainly in what they are right and in whatthey are wrong 
 cle yes i do ath but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them i amof opinion and if i am not mistaken there is a general every one of these poets has said many things well and manythings the reverse of well and if this be true then i do affirm thatmuch learning is dangerous to youth 
 cle how would you advise the guardian of the law to act 
 ath in what respect 
 cle i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide inpermitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learnothers do not shrink from answering 
 ath my good cleinias i rather think that i am fortunate 
 cle how so 
 ath i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern for when iconsider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now andwhich as i believe have been inspired by heaven they appear to meto be quite like a poem when i reflected upon all these words ofours i naturally felt pleasure for of all the discourses which ihave ever learnt or heard either in poetry or prose this seemed tome to be the justest and most suitable for young men to hear icannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian ofthe law who is also the director of education can have he cannot dobetter than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and anywhich are of a like nature if he should happen to find them eitherin poetry or prose or if he come across unwritten discourses akinto ours he should certainly preserve them and commit them towriting and first of all he shall constrain the teachers themselvesto learn and approve them and any of them who will not shall notbe employed by him but those whom he finds agreeing in hisjudgment he shall make use of and shall commit to them theinstruction and education of youth and here and on this wise let myfanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end 
 cle i do not think stranger that we have wandered out of theproposed limits of the argument but whether we are right or not inour whole conception i cannot be very certain 
 ath the truth cleinias may be expected to become clearer when aswe have often said we arrive at the end of the whole discussion aboutlaws 
 cle yes 
 ath and now that we have done with the teacher of letters theteacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us 
 cle certainly 
 ath i think that we have only to recollect our previousdiscussions and we shall be able to give suitable regulationstouching all this part of instruction and education to the teachers ofthe lyre 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath we were saying if i remember rightly that choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick intheir perceptions of rhythm and musical composition that they mightbe able to distinguish good and bad imitation that is to say theimitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence of the one and displaying the other in hymns and the souls of youth and inviting them to follow and attainvirtue by the way of imitation 
 cle very true 
 ath and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to usethe sounds of the lyre because its notes are pure the player whoteaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison butcomplexity and variation of notes when the strings give one soundand the poet or composer of the melody gives when theymake concords and harmonies in which lesser and greater and quick or high and low notes are again whenthey make complex variations of rhythms which they adapt to the notesof the that sort of thing is not suited to those who haveto acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three opposite principles are confusing and create a difficulty inlearning and our young men should learn quickly and their merenecessary acquirements are not few or trifling as will be shown indue course let the director of education attend to the principlesconcerning music which we are laying down as to the songs and wordsthemselves which the masters of choruses are to teach and thecharacter of them they have been already described by us and are thesame which when consecrated and adapted to the different said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocentamusement 
 cle that again is true 
 ath then let him who has been elected a director of music receivethese rules from us as containing the very truth and may he prosperin his office let us now proceed to lay down other rules inaddition to the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise ingeneral having said what remained to be said about the teaching ofmusic let us speak in like manner about gymnastic for boys and girlsought to learn to dance and practise gymnastic theynot 
 cle yes 
 ath then the boys ought to have dancing masters and the girlsdancing mistresses to exercise them 
 cle very good 
 ath then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern inthe business the superintendent of youth the director ofeducation he will have plenty to do if he is to have the chargeof music and gymnastic 
 cle but how will old man be able to attend to such great charges 
 ath o my friend there will be no difficulty for the law hasalready given and will give him permission to select as his assistantsin this charge any citizens male or female whom he desires and hewill know whom he ought to choose and will be anxious not to make amistake from a due sense of responsibility and from aconsciousness of the importance of his office and also because hewill consider that if young men have been and are well brought all things go swimmingly but if not it is not meet to do we say what will follow lest the regarders of omens shouldtake alarm about our infant state many things have been said by usabout dancing and about gymnastic movements in general for we includeunder gymnastics all military exercises such as archery and allhurling of weapons and the use of the light shield and allfighting with heavy arms and military evolutions and movements ofarmies and encampings and all that relates to horsemanship of allthese things there ought to be public teachers receiving pay from thestate and their pupils should be the men and boys in the state andalso the girls and women who are to know all these things while theyare yet girls they should have practised dancing in arms and the wholeart of women they should apply themselves toevolutions and tactics and the mode of grounding and taking uparms if for no other reason yet in case the whole military forceshould have to leave the city and carry on operations of waroutside that those who will have to guard the young and the rest ofthe city may be equal to the task and on the other hand whenenemies whether barbarian or hellenic come from without withmighty force and make a violent assault upon them and thus compelthem to fight for the possession of the city which is far frombeing an impossibility great would be the disgrace to the state ifthe women had been so miserably trained that they could not fightfor their young as birds will against any creature however die or undergo any danger but must instantly rush to thetemples and crowd at the altars and shrines and bring upon humannature the reproach that of all animals man is the most cowardly 
 cle such a want of education stranger is certainly an unseemlything to happen in a state as well as a great misfortune 
 ath suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying thatwomen ought not to neglect military matters but that all and female alike shall attend to them 
 cle i quite agree 
 ath of wrestling we have spoken in part but of what i shouldcall the most important part we have not spoken and cannot easilyspeak without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in wordwhat we mean when word and action combine and not till then weshall explain clearly what has been said pointing out that of allmovements wrestling is most akin to the military art and is to bepursued for the sake of this and not this for the sake of wrestling 
 cle excellent 
 ath enough of wrestling we will now proceed to speak of othermovements of the body such motion may be in general called is of two kinds one of nobler figures imitating thehonourable the other of the more ignoble figures imitating the of both these there are two further subdivisions of theserious one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart the otherexhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modestpleasures and may be truly called and is the dance of peace thewarrior dance is different from the peaceful one and may be rightlytermed pyrrhic this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missilesby dropping or giving way or springing aside or rising up or fallingdown also the opposite postures which are those of action as forexample the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins andof all sorts of blows and when the imitation is of brave bodies andsouls and the action is direct and muscular giving for the most parta straight movement to the limbs of the i say is thetrue sort but the opposite is not right in the dance of peace whatwe have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally andgracefully and after the manner of men who duly conform to the before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing about which thereis any doubt from that about which there is no doubt which is thedoubtful kind and how are the two to be distinguished there aredances of the bacchic sort both those in which as they say theyimitate drunken men and which are named after the nymphs and silenuses and satyrs and also those in which purifications aremade or mysteries this sort of dancing cannot berightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character orindeed as having any meaning whatever and may i think be mosttruly described as distinct from the warlike dance and distinctfrom the peaceful and not suited for a city at all there let it so leaving it to lie we will proceed to the dances of war andpeace for with these we are undoubtedly concerned now theunwarlike muse which honours in dance the gods and the sons of thegods is entirely associated with the consciousness of class may be subdivided into two lesser classes of which oneis expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good andhas greater pleasures the other expressive of preservation andincrease of former good in which the pleasure is less these cases every man when the pleasure is greater moves hisbody more and less when the pleasure is less and again if he bemore orderly and has learned courage from discipline he waves if he be a coward and has no training or he makesgreater and more violent movements and in general when he is speakingor singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still and soout of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing hasarisen and in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in anorderly another in a disorderly manner and as the ancients may beobserved to have given many names which are according to nature anddeserving of praise so there is an excellent one which they havegiven to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity aremoderate in their giver of names whoever he to them a very true and poetical and rational name when hecalled them emmeleiai or dances of order thus establishing two kindsof dances of the nobler sort the dance of war which he called thepyrrhic and the dance of peace which he called emmeleia or the danceof order giving to each their appropriate and becoming name thesethings the legislator should indicate in general outline and theguardian of the law should enquire into them and search them dancing with music and assigning to the several sacrificialfeasts that which is suitable to them and when he has consecrated allof them in due order he shall for the future change of dance or song thenceforward the city and the citizensshall continue to have the same pleasures themselves being as faras possible alike and shall live well and happily 
 i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodiesand generous souls but it is necessary also to consider and knowuncomely persons and thoughts and those which are intended to producelaughter in comedy and have a comic character in respect of and dance and of the imitations which these afford for seriousthings cannot be understood without laughable things nor opposites atall without opposites if a man is really to have intelligence ofeither but he can not carry out both in action if he is to haveany degree of virtue and for this very reason he should learn themboth in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything whichis ridiculous and out of should command slaves and hiredstrangers to imitate such things but he should never take any seriousinterest in them himself nor should any freeman or freewoman bediscovered taking pains to learn them and there should always be someelement of novelty in the imitation let these then be laid down bothin law and in our discourse as the regulations of laughableamusements which are generally called comedy and if any of theserious poets as they are termed who write tragedy come to us strangers may we go to your city and country or may we shall we bring with us our is your will about shall we answer the divine men i think that ouranswer should be as of strangers we will say to also according to our ability are tragic poets and our tragedyis the best and noblest for our whole state is an imitation of thebest and noblest life which we affirm to be indeed the very truthof tragedy you are poets and we are poets both makers of the samestrains rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas which truelaw can alone perfect as our hope is do not then suppose that weshall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora orintroduce the fair voices of your actors speaking above our permit you to harangue our women and children and the commonpeople about our institutions in language other than our own andvery often the opposite of our own for a state would be mad whichgave you this licence until the magistrates had determined whetheryour poetry might be recited and was fit for publication or o ye sons and scions of the softer muses first of all showyour songs to the magistrates and let them compare them with our if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus but ifnot then my friends we cannot let these then be the customsordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them and letmatters relating to slaves be separated from those relating tomasters if you do not object 
 cle we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put thematter thus 
 ath there still remain three studies suitable for is one of them the measurement of length surface anddepth is the second and the third has to do with the revolutions ofthe stars in relation to one another not every one has need to toilthrough all these things in a strictly scientific manner but only afew and who they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the will be the proper place not to know what is necessary formankind in general and what is the truth is disgraceful to everyone and yet to enter into these matters minutely is neither easy norat all possible for every one but there is something in them which isnecessary and cannot be set aside and probably he who made theproverb about god originally had this in view when he said even god himself can fight against meant if iam not mistaken divine necessity for as to the human necessitiesof which the many speak when they talk in this manner nothing can bemore ridiculous than such an application of the words 
 cle and what necessities of knowledge are there stranger whichare divine and not human 
 ath i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use norany knowledge at all cannot be a god or or hero to able to take any serious thought or charge of them and very unlikea divine man would he be who is unable to count one two three orto distinguish odd and even numbers or is unable to count at reckon night and day and who is totally unacquainted with therevolution of the sun and moon and the other stars there would begreat folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts ofknowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highestkinds of knowledge but which these are and how many there are ofthem and when they are to be learned and what is to be learnedtogether and what apart and the whole correlation of them must berightly apprehended first and these leading the way we may proceed tothe other parts of knowledge for so necessity grounded in natureconstrains us against which we say that no god contends or ever willcontend 
 cle i think stranger that what you have now said is very true andagreeable to nature 
 ath yes cleinias that is so but it is difficult for thelegislator to begin with these studies at a more convenient time wewill make regulations for them 
 cle you seem stranger to be afraid of our habitual ignorance ofthe subject there is no reason why that should prevent you fromspeaking out 
 ath i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which youallude but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves tothis sort of knowledge and apply themselves badly for entireignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil and is far from beingthe greatest of all too much cleverness and too much with an ill bringing up are far more fatal 
 cle true 
 ath all freemen i conceive should learn as much of these branchesof knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns thealphabet in that country arithmetical games have been invented forthe use of mere children which they learn as a pleasure andamusement they have to distribute apples and garlands using the samenumber sometimes for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number ofpersons and they arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pairtogether by lot or remain over and show how their turns come innatural order another mode of amusing them is to distributevessels sometimes of gold brass silver and the like intermixedwith one another sometimes of one metal only as i was saying theyadapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this waymake more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements andmovements of armies and expeditions in the management of ahousehold they make people more useful to themselves and more wideawake and again in measurements of things which have length andbreadth and depth they free us from that natural ignorance of allthese things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful 
 cle what kind of ignorance do you mean 
 ath o my dear cleinias i like yourself have late in life heardwith amazement of our ignorance in these matters to me we appear tobe more like pigs than men and i am quite ashamed not only ofmyself but of all hellenes 
 cle about what say stranger what you mean 
 ath i will or rather i will show you my meaning by a question anddo you please to answer me you know i suppose what length is 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what breadth is 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and you know that these are two distinct things and that thereis a third thing called depth 
 cle of course 
 ath and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable withthemselves 
 cle yes 
 ath that is to say length is naturally commensurable withlength and breadth with breadth and depth in like manner with depth 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath but if some things are commensurable and others whollyincommensurable and you think that all things are commensurable whatis your position in regard to them 
 cle clearly far from good 
 ath concerning length and breadth when compared with depth orbreadth when and length when compared with one another are not allthe hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one in some way 
 cle quite true 
 ath but if they are absolutely incommensurable and yet all of usregard them as commensurable have we not reason to be ashamed ofour compatriots and might we not say to ye best ofhellenes is not this one of the things of which we were saying thatnot to know them is disgraceful and of which to have a bare knowledgeonly is no great distinction 
 cle certainly 
 ath and there are other things akin to these in which there springup other errors of the same family 
 cle what are they 
 ath the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantitiesin their relation to one another a man who is good for a thingought to be able when he thinks to distinguish them and differentpersons should compete with one another in asking questions whichwill be a fair better and more graceful way of passing their timethan the old game of draughts 
 cle i dare say and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game ofdraughts 
 ath and these as i maintain cleinias are the studies which ouryouth ought to learn for they are innocent and not difficult thelearning of them will be an amusement and they will benefit thestate if anyone is of another mind let him say what he has to say 
 cle certainly 
 ath then if these studies are such as we maintain we will includethem if not they shall be excluded 
 cle assuredly but may we not now stranger prescribe thesestudies as necessary and so fill up the lacunae of our laws 
 ath they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafterredeemed and removed from our state if they do not please either uswho give them or you who accept them 
 cle a fair condition 
 ath next let us see whether we are or are not willing that thestudy of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth 
 cle proceed 
 ath here occurs a strange phenomenon which certainly cannot in anypoint of view be tolerated 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god andthe nature of the universe nor busy ourselves in searching out thecauses of things and that such enquiries are impious whereas thevery opposite is the truth 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical and atvariance with the usual language of age but when any one has any goodand true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in everyway acceptable to god he cannot abstain from expressing it 
 cle your words are reasonable enough but shall we find any good ortrue notion about the stars 
 ath my good friends at this hour all of us hellenes tell i may use such an expression about those great gods the sun andthe moon 
 cle lies of what nature 
 ath we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the samepath and we call them planets or wanderers 
 cle very true stranger and in the course of my life i haveoften myself seen the morning star and the evening star and diversothers not moving in their accustomed course but wandering out oftheir path in all manner of ways and i have seen the sun and moondoing what we all know that they do 
 ath just so megillus and cleinias and i maintain that ourcitizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the godsin heaven so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to themin pious language and not to blaspheme about them 
 cle there you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable andif we are wrong in our mode of speaking now and can be betterinstructed and learn to use better language then i quite agree withyou that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightlyshould be acquired by us and now do you try to explain to us yourwhole meaning and we on our part will endeavour to understand you 
 ath there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning but not avery great one nor will any great length of time be required andof this i am myself a proof for i did not know these things long in the days of my youth and yet i can explain them to you in abrief space of time whereas if they had been difficult i couldcertainly never have explained them all old as i am to old menlike yourselves 
 cle true but what is this study which you describe as wonderfuland fitting for youth to learn but of which we are ignorant tryand explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can 
 ath i will for o my good friends that other doctrine about thewandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not thetruth but the very reverse of the truth each of them moves in thesame in many paths but in one only which is circular andthe varieties are only apparent nor are we right in supposing thatthe swiftest of them is the slowest nor conversely that theslowest is the quickest and if what i say is true only justimagine that we had a similar notion about horses running atolympia or about men who ran in the long course and that weaddressed the swiftest as the slowest and the slowest as the sang the praises of the vanquished as though he were that case our praises would not be true nor very agreeableto the runners though they be but men and now to commit the sameerror about the gods which would have been ludicrous and erroneousin the case of not that ludicrous and erroneous 
 cle worse than ludicrous i should say 
 ath at all events the gods cannot like us to be spreading afalse report of them 
 cle most true if such is the fact 
 ath and if we can show that such is really the fact then all thesematters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidanceof impiety but if we cannot they may be let alone and let this beour decision 
 cle very good 
 ath enough of laws relating to education and learning buthunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention forthe legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goesbeyond mere legislation there is something over and above law whichlies in a region between admonition and law and has several timesoccurred to us in the course of discussion for example in theeducation of very young children there were things as we are not to be defined and to regard them as matters of positivelaw is a great absurdity now our laws and the whole constitutionof our state having been thus delineated the praise of the virtuouscitizen is not complete when he is described as the person whoserves the laws best and obeys them most but the higher form ofpraise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passesthrough life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame thisis the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen andthe true legislator ought not only to write his laws but also tointerweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable anddishonourable and the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthenthese no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned bypunishments i will adduce an example which will clear up mymeaning and will be a sort of witness to my words hunting is of wideextent and has a name under which many things are included for thereis a hunting of creatures in the water and of creatures in the there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds andnot of wild beasts only the hunting after man is also worthy ofconsideration there is the hunting after him in war and there isoften a hunting after him in the way of friendship which is praisedand also blamed and there is thieving and the hunting which ispractised by robbers and that of armies against armies now thelegislator in laying down laws about hunting can neither abstainfrom noting these things nor can he make threatening ordinances whichwill assign rules and penalties about all of them what is he to will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exerciseand pursuits of youth and on the other hand the young man mustlisten obediently neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him and heshould regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions ofthe legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by being premised there will follow next in order moderate praiseand censure of hunting the praise being assigned to that kind whichwill make the souls of young men better and the censure to that whichhas the opposite effect 
 and now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for theirwelfare o friends we will say to them may no desire or love ofhunting in the sea or of angling or of catching the creatures inthe waters ever take possession of you either when you are awakeor when you are asleep by hook or with weels which latter is avery lazy contrivance and let not any desire of catching men and ofpiracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawlesshunters and as to the desire of thieving in town or country may itnever enter into your most passing thoughts nor let the insidiousfancy of catching birds which is hardly worthy of freemen comeinto the head of any youth there remains therefore for our athletesonly the hunting and catching of land animals of which the one sortis called hunting by night in which the hunters sleep in turn and arelazy this is not to be commended any more than that which hasintervals of rest in which the will strength of beasts is subduedby nets and snares and not by the victory of a laborious only the best kind of hunting is allowed at ofquadrupeds which is carried on with horses and dogs and ownpersons and they get the victory over the animals by running themdown and striking them and hurling at them those who have a care ofgodlike manhood taking them with their own hands the praise and blamewhich is assigned to all these things has now been declared and letthe law be as no one hinder these who verily are sacredhunters from following the chase wherever and whither soever theywill but the hunter by night who trusts to his nets and not be allowed to hunt anywhere the fowler in the mountains andwaste places shall be permitted but on cultivated ground and onconsecrated wilds he shall not be permitted and any one who meets himmay stop him as to the hunter in waters he may hunt anywhereexcept in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools providedonly that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices and nowwe may say that all our enactments about education are complete

 athenian stranger next with the help of the delphian oracle wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what godsthey shall be offered but when they shall be offered and howoften may be partly regulated by us 
 cleinias the 
 ath then we will first determine the number and let the wholenumber be one for every that one magistrate at least willsacrifice daily to some god or on behalf of the city and thecitizens and their possessions and the interpreters and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with theguardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take note of what is omitted the law will say that there aretwelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the severaltribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year andthey shall have festivals for women distinguishing those whichought to be separated from the festivals and those whichought not further they shall not confuse the infernal deities andtheir rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites butshall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth is sacred to him according to the law to such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour himas being always the best friend of man for the connection of soul andbody is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready tomaintain quite seriously moreover those who would regulate thesematters rightly should consider that our city among existing citieshas fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to livehappily and those who would live happily should in the first place dono wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged byothers to attain the first is not difficult but there is greatdifficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged no man can beperfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a lifeof peace but if evil a life of war within and without wherefore thecitizens ought to practise in time of war but rather whilethey are at peace and every city which has any sense should take thefield at least for one day in every month and for more if themagistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer they should go out en masse including their wives and theirchildren when the magistrates determine to lead forth the wholepeople or in separate portions when summoned by them and they shouldalways provide that there should be games and sacrificial they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real battles and they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on oneanother according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best andblaming him who is the opposite and let poets celebrate however every poet but only one who in the first place isnot less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the state creators of noble theirpoems be sung even though they be not very musical and let thejudgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and theyalone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall nothave this liberty nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus butonly and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred anddedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men whichpraise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly 
 the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry oughtto apply equally to men and women the legislator may be supposed toargue the question in his own are my citizens for whom ihave set in order the city are they not competitors in the greatestof all contests and have they not innumerable rivals to be be the natural reply well but if we were training boxers orpancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meetuntil the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepareourselves previously by daily practice surely if we were boxers weshould have been learning to fight for many days before andexercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that wemight come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses weshould put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power and if there were a lackof competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising at that or if we had noadversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves in what other manner couldwe ever study the art of 
 cle the way which you mention stranger would be the only way 
 ath and shall the warriors of our city who are destined whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight fortheir lives and their children and their property and the wholecity be worse prepared than boxers and will the he is afraid that their practising with one another may appearto some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out andfight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end and also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as everymonth and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush andimitating in every respect the reality of war fighting and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhatdangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order thatthe sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to themrespectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict oflife if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide isinvoluntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purifiedaccording to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few menshould die others as good as they will be born but that if fear isdead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew 
 cle we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate aboutsuch things and that the whole state should practise them supposed 
 ath and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sorthardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speakingof is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators 
 cle perhaps 
 ath certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency 
 cle what are they 
 ath one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs never for a moment allows them to think of anything but theirown private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangssuspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end and they laugh at every is onereason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable pursuit but from an insatiable love of goldand silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemlyor unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make noobjection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterlybase if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of waythe gratification of his lusts 
 cle true 
 ath let this then be deemed one of the causes which preventstates from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or anyother noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto merchants and captains of ships and servants and convertsthe valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples andviolent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability butthey are unfortunate 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled topass through life always hungering 
 cle then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another 
 ath thank you for reminding me 
 cle the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightlypractising the arts of and now tell me what is theother 
 ath do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity 
 cle no but we think that you are too severe upon temper of which you seem in the present discussion tohave a peculiar dislike 
 ath that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceedto the second cause 
 cle proceed 
 ath i say that governments are a concerning which i have often spoken in the previousdiscourse or rather governments they are not for none of themexercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may betruly called states of discord in which while the government isvoluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to becoerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he canhelp allow him to become either noble or rich or strong orvaliant or warlike at all these two are the chief causes of almostall evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they arenotably the causes but our state has escaped both of them for hercitizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to oneanother and will i think be made by these laws the reverse oflovers of money such a constitution may be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will accept the education which we havedescribed and the martial pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea 
 cle true 
 ath then next we must remember about all gymnastic only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes of victory and those which are not military are to be givenup the military sort had better be completely described andestablished by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness 
 cle very good 
 ath certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity of body whether of foot or hand for escaping or forcapturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but and combat need vigour and strength 
 cle very true 
 ath neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency withoutarms 
 cle how can they 
 ath then our herald in accordance with the prevailing first summon the will appear armed for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize and he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is torun the double course third he who is to run the andfourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run acourse of sixty stadia to some temple of we will send forthanother whom we will style the more heavily armed to run oversmoother ground there remains the archer and he shall run in thefull equipments of an archer a distance of stadia overmountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo andartemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will waitfor them until they return and will give a prize to the conquerorin each 
 cle very good 
 ath let us suppose that there are three kinds of ofboys another of beardless youths and a third of men for theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at and forthe boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archersor as heavy armed touching the women let the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium and the double course and and the long course and let them run on itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses let thesebe the regulations about contests in running both for men and women 
 respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similarcontests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour ofone against one and two against two and so on up to ten against to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent inorder to gain the in wrestling the masters of the art havelaid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us andbe our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say whodeserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not todo or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who isdefeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they marriedas well as to men the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combatof the light armed they shall contend with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slingsand by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law 
 next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in acountry like crete and hence we naturally do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about horse races there is no one whokeeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry and therefore we give our prizes for single who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who areintermediate and for the horses themselves and thus ourequestrian games will accord with the nature of the country letthem have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with thelaw and let the colonels and generals of horse decide togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors in them but we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or inthese contests on the other hand the cretan bowman or fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may aswell place a competition of this sort among amusements women arenot to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if fromprevious training they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and noblame to them 
 thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it havebeen described and we have spoken also of the toils of the of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters relates to music has been for the most part completed but asto rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have been appointed for gods and whether everythird year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or mannerthe gods may put into minds the distribution and order ofthem at the same time we may expect that the musical contests willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law meeting togetherfor this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing ingeneral what they ought severally to be in language and song andin the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has beenoften declared by the original legislator and his successors ought tofollow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times and appointing public festivals it is not difficult todetermine how these and the like matters may have a regular again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm tothe state there is however another matter of great importance anddifficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it but seeingthat divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the city and is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man hishelper but himself standing alone and following reason only 
 cle what is this stranger that you are saying for we do not asyet understand your meaning 
 ath very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more i came to the subject of education i beheld young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one another and therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidensare well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whoseonly cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals anddances how in such a state as this will they abstain from desireswhich thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from whichreason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain theordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young and never to losesight of them and these provisions do as far as human means caneffect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires ingeneral but how can we take precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat a danger truly cleinias here is a difficulty in many wayscrete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confessthat they are quite against us for if any one following nature shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of laius anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point buthe would be wholly at variance with the custom of your they are repugnant to a principle which we say that alegislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue and which not and suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at leastnot disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue willsuch passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of will ever believe rather who will not blame theeffeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst them will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates thewoman and who would ever think of establishing such a practice bylaw certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law howcan we prove that what i am saying is true he who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature of friendship and of these loves for they are of two kinds and out ofthe two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarityof name causes all the difficulty and obscurity 
 cle how is that 
 ath dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to theequal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who isin want and when either of these friendships becomes excessive weterm the excess love 
 cle very true 
 ath the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible andcoarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises fromlikeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts throughlife as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there of all a in determining what he who is possessed by thisthird love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is indoubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth and the other forbidding him for the one is alover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit andwould fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards thesatisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences andrespects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishesto live chastely with the chaste object of his affection now the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that which we havedescribed as the third seeing then that there are these three sortsof love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to existamong us is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible and the other two if possible weshould hinder what do you say friend megillus 
 megillus i think stranger that you are perfectly right in whatyou have been now saying 
 ath i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent whichi accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom anyfurther cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent atsome other time enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws 
 meg very good 
 ath upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which inone respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawlessnatures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirelywith their will 
 meg when do you mean 
 ath when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfectsafeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes placebetween them nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them 
 meg very true 
 ath does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort 
 meg what word 
 ath the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and mostinfamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever saidthe opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them always and in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy when thepoet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareushaving secret intercourse with his sister he represents him whenfound out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin 
 meg you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath ofopposition ever assails it has a marvellous power 
 ath am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily know howto subdue them he will consecrate the tradition of their evilcharacter among all slaves and freemen women and the will be the surest foundation of the lawwhich he can make 
 meg yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use thesame language about them 
 ath a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing themin stony places in which they will take no root and that i wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely to grow now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse of parents and a to other sensual desires and conquering them would bethe source of ten thousand blessings for in the first is the appointment of nature and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by andwho on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that weare making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with hisoutcry and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting andperpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but inanother most difficult there is no difficulty in seeing that such alaw is possible and in what way for as i was saying theordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man andterrify him into obedience but matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired result seems as if it could not beattained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also deemed impossible and although this latter ispartly disproven by the fact of their existence among you stilleven in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural and impossible i was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe human heart when i said that the permanent establishment ofthese things is very difficult 
 meg very true 
 ath shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyondhuman nature 
 cle by all means 
 ath is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of loveand to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a goodcondition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training 
 cle he will be far more temperate when he is in training 
 ath and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view tothe olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of histraining and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus andmany others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far morelusty 
 cle no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by theancients of these athletes 
 ath and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running andthe like and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is thenoblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them as we hope into the belief of this by tales andsayings and songs 
 cle of what victory are you speaking 
 ath of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will livehappily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior people have mastered 
 cle i dare say 
 ath and since we have reached this point in our legislation andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts ingeneral who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovinglypair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness andinnocence abiding firmly in their original we willsay to them you should be better than the animals but if they arecorrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves arenot able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of thelaw exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a secondlaw against them 
 cle and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed 
 ath clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow 
 cle what is that 
 ath our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen withindulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body and this will happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure ifseldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress they should not befound out doing anything of the sort concealment shall be sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription onthe other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable butnot to abstain wholly in this way there will be a second legalstandard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion ofright three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whomwe call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and willcompel them not to transgress 
 cle what are they 
 ath the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire ofbeauty not in the body but in the soul these are aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if theycould only be realized in all states and god willing in thematter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thatno one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least wemay abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as towomen if any man has to do with any but those who come into his houseduly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired inany other way and he offends publicly in the face of all shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours andprivileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger letthis law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of thesexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wronglyindulged 
 meg i for my part stranger would gladly receive this shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion 
 cle i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present ithink that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws 
 meg very good 
 ath we had got about as far as the establishment of the commontables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom there might arise aquestion about the manner of they shall be such as theyare here in crete or such as they are in is there athird kind which may be better than either of them the answer to thisquestion might be easily discovered but the discovery would do nogreat good for at present they are very well ordered 
 leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the meansof providing food now in cities the means of life are gained in manyways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereasour city has only one for most of the hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land but our citizens from land only and this makes the taskof the legislator less as many laws will be enough andmuch less than half and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand moneylending and compound interest and innumerable to these he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds and and to the guardians and superintendents oftheir implements and he has already legislated for greater for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture ofchildren and for education and the establishment of he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour inpreparing it 
 let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall becalled the laws of husbandmen and let the first of them be the law ofzeus the god of boundaries let no one shift the boundary line eitherof a who is a neighbour or if he dwells at theextremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with that this is truly to move the immovable and everyone should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is thewitness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of thestranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stirup he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences ofdisobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to adouble penalty the first coming from the gods and the second fromthe law for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of land and if any one does let him who will inform thelandowners and let them bring him into court and if he beconvicted of the land by stealth or by force let thecourt determine what he ought to suffer or pay in the next small injuries done by neighbours to one another through theirmultiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood avery disagreeable and bitter thing wherefore a man ought to be verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour andespecially of encroaching on his land for any man mayeasily do harm but not every man can do good to another he whoencroaches on his land and transgresses his make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and alsoof his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall takecognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the the more important cases as has been already said the wholenumber of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if anyone pastures his cattle on his land they shall see theinjury and adjudge the penalty and if any one by decoying the possession of swarms and draws them to himself bymaking noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his property he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates and if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his own and his he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments ofmany law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had ofold excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why weshould propose to divert their course who likes may draw water fromthe of the common stream on to his own land if he donot cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other he may take the water in any direction which he pleases exceptthrough a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to dono harm beyond the channel and if there be in any place a naturaldryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is requiredfor his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited intheir supply let him have a fixed measure which shall bedetermined by the wardens of the country this he shall receive eachday and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water ifthere be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures sometiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall byrefusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lowerneighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him whowill call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he bein the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what each of them is to do and he who will not abide bythe decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and paya fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of theinjury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates 
 now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise thegoddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysuswhich is not treasured up the other which nature intends to bestored let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn hewho tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes orfigs before the season of vintage which coincides with on his own land or on that of him pay fiftydrachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from hisown land and if from his land a mina and if from anyothers of a mina and he who would gather the or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take themoff his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but ifhe take them from the ground of others without their leave let him inthat case be always punished in accordance with the law whichordains that he should not move what he has not laid down and if aslave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the ownerof the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch or figs on the let a metic purchase autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat lethim take of the choice grapes for himself and a single followerwithout payment as a tribute of hospitality the law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used foreating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of themin ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying byas dried figs as to pears and apples and pomegranates andsimilar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shallbe struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows of these fruits the strangermay partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn and if anelder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on thespot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all suchfruits but he must carry away nothing if however he will notobey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time 
 water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easilypolluted you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun orthe air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divertthem or steal them but all these things may very likely happen inregard to water which must therefore be protected by law and letthis be the any one intentionally pollutes the water ofanother whether the water of a spring or collected in by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let theinjured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city andclaim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guiltyof injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not onlypay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification to be made by the offender in each case 
 with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let aman if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which heeither does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses now of these things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force inthe use which he makes of his own property all these matters a manshould lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposingthe injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a chargeagainst another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suitinto the public courts and have the punished but if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes inan unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injuredparty any one may bring the offences of magistrates in anyparticular case before the public courts there are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes of punishment and applicationsfor suits and summonses and the witnesses to two witnesses should be required for a summons or all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation butare beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator these lesser matters asthey indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a youngergeneration regulate by law after the patterns which have according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let therebe no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them 
 now of artisans let the regulations be as the firstplace let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied inhandicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public orderof the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds ofknowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintendingsome one else who is practising another let this then be ourfirst principle in the one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend art rather than his own under the pretext that insuperintending many servants who are working for him he is likelyto superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them than from his own art but let every man in the state haveone art and get his living by that let the wardens of the citylabour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any otherart than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace andinfamy until they bring him back into his own right course and ifany stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds andmoney penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel himto be one only and not many 
 but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to anyother up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide thecase but if greater amount be involved then let the public courtsdecide according to law let no one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come fromabroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry or the materials of any art which have to be imported andwhich are not one should import them nor again shouldany one export anything which is wanted in the country of all thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from theguardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order tothe five seniors concerning arms and all implements which are formilitary purposes if there be need of introducing any art orplant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war letthe commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation and exportation the city shall send them out and alsoreceive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws about them but let there be no retail trade for the sake either in these or any other articles in the city orcountry at all 
 with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of thecountry the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is thecustom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them let thetwelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to whichthe rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as theanimals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be dividedin due proportion into three parts one part for freemen anotherfor their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city andlike other men must live or those who come on some business whichthey have with the state or with some individual let only this thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the no one shall be compelled to sell and how will they bebest distributed in the first place we see clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point of view and in anotherpoint of view of unequals 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes thevarious articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse 
 cle of course 
 ath such being the case let no one of the three portions begreater than either of the other that which is assigned tomasters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he havingpower to determine the quantity and quality and what remains he shalldistribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained from the earth taking the whole number of them 
 in the second place our citizens should have separate houses dulyordered and this will be the order proper for men like them thereshall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth in each hamlet they shall first set apart a andthe temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if therebe any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancientdeities whose memory has been preserved to these let them paytheir ancient honours but hestia and zeus and athene will havetemples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of thetwelve districts and the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples where the ground is highest in order to provide thesafest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards all therest of the country they shall settle in the following make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shallestablish in the city and this again they shall subdivide intotwelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country round about andin each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with aview to the convenience of the husbandmen and the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters andsee how many of them and which class of them each place fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and mostuseful to the husbandman and the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar matters in the city 
 now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of theagora their first care after the temples which are in the agora havebeen seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any indealings between man and man in the second place as beinginspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him whorequires chastisement touching articles of gale they should firstsee whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains and let thelaw be as the first day of the month the persons incharge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have thecharge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers theportion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portionof the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month andother cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell and the other buy liquidssufficient to last during the whole month and on the daythere shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who want to buy and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either wovenor made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others as to the retail trade inthese things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the strangersell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retailtrade and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals to the strangers and artisans and their servants let anystranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from thosewho have the care of it in the country and let him sell to thestrangers as much he pleases and when he pleases as to other goodsand implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell themin common market at any place which the guardians of the law andthe wardens of the market and city choosing according to theirjudgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange moneyfor goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to theother and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtainhis money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected bylaw but whenever property has been bought or sold greater inquantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determinedwithin what limited a man may increase and diminish his the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the case of diminution let there be an erasure made and let thesame rule be observed about the registration of the property of themetics any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwellin the land but he must practise an art and not abide more thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered himself andhe shall pay no tax however small except good any other tax for buying and selling but when the twenty yearshave expired he shall take his property with him and depart and ifin the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and hethinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either togrant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city andwhatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect for thechildren of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year andlet them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but anyof them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade thecouncil and assembly and if he depart let him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the register kept by themagistrates

 athenian stranger next with the help of the delphian oracle wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what godsthey shall be offered but when they shall be offered and howoften may be partly regulated by us 
 cleinias the 
 ath then we will first determine the number and let the wholenumber be one for every that one magistrate at least willsacrifice daily to some god or on behalf of the city and thecitizens and their possessions and the interpreters and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with theguardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take note of what is omitted the law will say that there aretwelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the severaltribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year andthey shall have festivals for women distinguishing those whichought to be separated from the festivals and those whichought not further they shall not confuse the infernal deities andtheir rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites butshall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth is sacred to him according to the law to such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour himas being always the best friend of man for the connection of soul andbody is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready tomaintain quite seriously moreover those who would regulate thesematters rightly should consider that our city among existing citieshas fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to livehappily and those who would live happily should in the first place dono wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged byothers to attain the first is not difficult but there is greatdifficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged no man can beperfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a lifeof peace but if evil a life of war within and without wherefore thecitizens ought to practise in time of war but rather whilethey are at peace and every city which has any sense should take thefield at least for one day in every month and for more if themagistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer they should go out en masse including their wives and theirchildren when the magistrates determine to lead forth the wholepeople or in separate portions when summoned by them and they shouldalways provide that there should be games and sacrificial they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real battles and they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on oneanother according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best andblaming him who is the opposite and let poets celebrate however every poet but only one who in the first place isnot less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the state creators of noble theirpoems be sung even though they be not very musical and let thejudgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and theyalone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall nothave this liberty nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus butonly and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred anddedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men whichpraise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly 
 the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry oughtto apply equally to men and women the legislator may be supposed toargue the question in his own are my citizens for whom ihave set in order the city are they not competitors in the greatestof all contests and have they not innumerable rivals to be be the natural reply well but if we were training boxers orpancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meetuntil the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepareourselves previously by daily practice surely if we were boxers weshould have been learning to fight for many days before andexercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that wemight come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses weshould put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power and if there were a lackof competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising at that or if we had noadversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves in what other manner couldwe ever study the art of 
 cle the way which you mention stranger would be the only way 
 ath and shall the warriors of our city who are destined whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight fortheir lives and their children and their property and the wholecity be worse prepared than boxers and will the he is afraid that their practising with one another may appearto some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out andfight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end and also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as everymonth and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush andimitating in every respect the reality of war fighting and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhatdangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order thatthe sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to themrespectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict oflife if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide isinvoluntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purifiedaccording to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few menshould die others as good as they will be born but that if fear isdead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew 
 cle we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate aboutsuch things and that the whole state should practise them supposed 
 ath and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sorthardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speakingof is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators 
 cle perhaps 
 ath certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency 
 cle what are they 
 ath one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs never for a moment allows them to think of anything but theirown private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangssuspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end and they laugh at every is onereason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable pursuit but from an insatiable love of goldand silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemlyor unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make noobjection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterlybase if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of waythe gratification of his lusts 
 cle true 
 ath let this then be deemed one of the causes which preventstates from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or anyother noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto merchants and captains of ships and servants and convertsthe valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples andviolent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability butthey are unfortunate 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled topass through life always hungering 
 cle then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another 
 ath thank you for reminding me 
 cle the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightlypractising the arts of and now tell me what is theother 
 ath do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity 
 cle no but we think that you are too severe upon temper of which you seem in the present discussion tohave a peculiar dislike 
 ath that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceedto the second cause 
 cle proceed 
 ath i say that governments are a concerning which i have often spoken in the previousdiscourse or rather governments they are not for none of themexercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may betruly called states of discord in which while the government isvoluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to becoerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he canhelp allow him to become either noble or rich or strong orvaliant or warlike at all these two are the chief causes of almostall evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they arenotably the causes but our state has escaped both of them for hercitizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to oneanother and will i think be made by these laws the reverse oflovers of money such a constitution may be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will accept the education which we havedescribed and the martial pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea 
 cle true 
 ath then next we must remember about all gymnastic only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes of victory and those which are not military are to be givenup the military sort had better be completely described andestablished by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness 
 cle very good 
 ath certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity of body whether of foot or hand for escaping or forcapturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but and combat need vigour and strength 
 cle very true 
 ath neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency withoutarms 
 cle how can they 
 ath then our herald in accordance with the prevailing first summon the will appear armed for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize and he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is torun the double course third he who is to run the andfourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run acourse of sixty stadia to some temple of we will send forthanother whom we will style the more heavily armed to run oversmoother ground there remains the archer and he shall run in thefull equipments of an archer a distance of stadia overmountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo andartemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will waitfor them until they return and will give a prize to the conquerorin each 
 cle very good 
 ath let us suppose that there are three kinds of ofboys another of beardless youths and a third of men for theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at and forthe boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archersor as heavy armed touching the women let the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium and the double course and and the long course and let them run on itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses let thesebe the regulations about contests in running both for men and women 
 respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similarcontests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour ofone against one and two against two and so on up to ten against to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent inorder to gain the in wrestling the masters of the art havelaid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us andbe our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say whodeserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not todo or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who isdefeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they marriedas well as to men the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combatof the light armed they shall contend with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slingsand by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law 
 next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in acountry like crete and hence we naturally do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about horse races there is no one whokeeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry and therefore we give our prizes for single who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who areintermediate and for the horses themselves and thus ourequestrian games will accord with the nature of the country letthem have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with thelaw and let the colonels and generals of horse decide togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors in them but we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or inthese contests on the other hand the cretan bowman or fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may aswell place a competition of this sort among amusements women arenot to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if fromprevious training they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and noblame to them 
 thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it havebeen described and we have spoken also of the toils of the of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters relates to music has been for the most part completed but asto rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have been appointed for gods and whether everythird year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or mannerthe gods may put into minds the distribution and order ofthem at the same time we may expect that the musical contests willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law meeting togetherfor this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing ingeneral what they ought severally to be in language and song andin the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has beenoften declared by the original legislator and his successors ought tofollow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times and appointing public festivals it is not difficult todetermine how these and the like matters may have a regular again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm tothe state there is however another matter of great importance anddifficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it but seeingthat divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the city and is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man hishelper but himself standing alone and following reason only 
 cle what is this stranger that you are saying for we do not asyet understand your meaning 
 ath very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more i came to the subject of education i beheld young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one another and therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidensare well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whoseonly cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals anddances how in such a state as this will they abstain from desireswhich thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from whichreason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain theordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young and never to losesight of them and these provisions do as far as human means caneffect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires ingeneral but how can we take precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat a danger truly cleinias here is a difficulty in many wayscrete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confessthat they are quite against us for if any one following nature shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of laius anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point buthe would be wholly at variance with the custom of your they are repugnant to a principle which we say that alegislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue and which not and suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at leastnot disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue willsuch passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of will ever believe rather who will not blame theeffeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst them will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates thewoman and who would ever think of establishing such a practice bylaw certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law howcan we prove that what i am saying is true he who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature of friendship and of these loves for they are of two kinds and out ofthe two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarityof name causes all the difficulty and obscurity 
 cle how is that 
 ath dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to theequal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who isin want and when either of these friendships becomes excessive weterm the excess love 
 cle very true 
 ath the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible andcoarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises fromlikeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts throughlife as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there of all a in determining what he who is possessed by thisthird love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is indoubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth and the other forbidding him for the one is alover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit andwould fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards thesatisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences andrespects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishesto live chastely with the chaste object of his affection now the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that which we havedescribed as the third seeing then that there are these three sortsof love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to existamong us is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible and the other two if possible weshould hinder what do you say friend megillus 
 megillus i think stranger that you are perfectly right in whatyou have been now saying 
 ath i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent whichi accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom anyfurther cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent atsome other time enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws 
 meg very good 
 ath upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which inone respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawlessnatures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirelywith their will 
 meg when do you mean 
 ath when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfectsafeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes placebetween them nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them 
 meg very true 
 ath does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort 
 meg what word 
 ath the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and mostinfamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever saidthe opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them always and in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy when thepoet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareushaving secret intercourse with his sister he represents him whenfound out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin 
 meg you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath ofopposition ever assails it has a marvellous power 
 ath am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily know howto subdue them he will consecrate the tradition of their evilcharacter among all slaves and freemen women and the will be the surest foundation of the lawwhich he can make 
 meg yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use thesame language about them 
 ath a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing themin stony places in which they will take no root and that i wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely to grow now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse of parents and a to other sensual desires and conquering them would bethe source of ten thousand blessings for in the first is the appointment of nature and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by andwho on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that weare making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with hisoutcry and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting andperpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but inanother most difficult there is no difficulty in seeing that such alaw is possible and in what way for as i was saying theordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man andterrify him into obedience but matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired result seems as if it could not beattained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also deemed impossible and although this latter ispartly disproven by the fact of their existence among you stilleven in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural and impossible i was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe human heart when i said that the permanent establishment ofthese things is very difficult 
 meg very true 
 ath shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyondhuman nature 
 cle by all means 
 ath is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of loveand to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a goodcondition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training 
 cle he will be far more temperate when he is in training 
 ath and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view tothe olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of histraining and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus andmany others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far morelusty 
 cle no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by theancients of these athletes 
 ath and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running andthe like and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is thenoblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them as we hope into the belief of this by tales andsayings and songs 
 cle of what victory are you speaking 
 ath of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will livehappily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior people have mastered 
 cle i dare say 
 ath and since we have reached this point in our legislation andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts ingeneral who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovinglypair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness andinnocence abiding firmly in their original we willsay to them you should be better than the animals but if they arecorrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves arenot able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of thelaw exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a secondlaw against them 
 cle and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed 
 ath clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow 
 cle what is that 
 ath our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen withindulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body and this will happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure ifseldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress they should not befound out doing anything of the sort concealment shall be sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription onthe other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable butnot to abstain wholly in this way there will be a second legalstandard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion ofright three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whomwe call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and willcompel them not to transgress 
 cle what are they 
 ath the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire ofbeauty not in the body but in the soul these are aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if theycould only be realized in all states and god willing in thematter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thatno one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least wemay abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as towomen if any man has to do with any but those who come into his houseduly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired inany other way and he offends publicly in the face of all shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours andprivileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger letthis law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of thesexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wronglyindulged 
 meg i for my part stranger would gladly receive this shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion 
 cle i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present ithink that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws 
 meg very good 
 ath we had got about as far as the establishment of the commontables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom there might arise aquestion about the manner of they shall be such as theyare here in crete or such as they are in is there athird kind which may be better than either of them the answer to thisquestion might be easily discovered but the discovery would do nogreat good for at present they are very well ordered 
 leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the meansof providing food now in cities the means of life are gained in manyways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereasour city has only one for most of the hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land but our citizens from land only and this makes the taskof the legislator less as many laws will be enough andmuch less than half and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand moneylending and compound interest and innumerable to these he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds and and to the guardians and superintendents oftheir implements and he has already legislated for greater for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture ofchildren and for education and the establishment of he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour inpreparing it 
 let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall becalled the laws of husbandmen and let the first of them be the law ofzeus the god of boundaries let no one shift the boundary line eitherof a who is a neighbour or if he dwells at theextremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with that this is truly to move the immovable and everyone should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is thewitness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of thestranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stirup he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences ofdisobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to adouble penalty the first coming from the gods and the second fromthe law for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of land and if any one does let him who will inform thelandowners and let them bring him into court and if he beconvicted of the land by stealth or by force let thecourt determine what he ought to suffer or pay in the next small injuries done by neighbours to one another through theirmultiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood avery disagreeable and bitter thing wherefore a man ought to be verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour andespecially of encroaching on his land for any man mayeasily do harm but not every man can do good to another he whoencroaches on his land and transgresses his make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and alsoof his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall takecognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the the more important cases as has been already said the wholenumber of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if anyone pastures his cattle on his land they shall see theinjury and adjudge the penalty and if any one by decoying the possession of swarms and draws them to himself bymaking noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his property he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates and if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his own and his he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments ofmany law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had ofold excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why weshould propose to divert their course who likes may draw water fromthe of the common stream on to his own land if he donot cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other he may take the water in any direction which he pleases exceptthrough a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to dono harm beyond the channel and if there be in any place a naturaldryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is requiredfor his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited intheir supply let him have a fixed measure which shall bedetermined by the wardens of the country this he shall receive eachday and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water ifthere be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures sometiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall byrefusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lowerneighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him whowill call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he bein the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what each of them is to do and he who will not abide bythe decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and paya fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of theinjury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates 
 now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise thegoddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysuswhich is not treasured up the other which nature intends to bestored let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn hewho tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes orfigs before the season of vintage which coincides with on his own land or on that of him pay fiftydrachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from hisown land and if from his land a mina and if from anyothers of a mina and he who would gather the or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take themoff his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but ifhe take them from the ground of others without their leave let him inthat case be always punished in accordance with the law whichordains that he should not move what he has not laid down and if aslave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the ownerof the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch or figs on the let a metic purchase autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat lethim take of the choice grapes for himself and a single followerwithout payment as a tribute of hospitality the law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used foreating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of themin ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying byas dried figs as to pears and apples and pomegranates andsimilar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shallbe struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows of these fruits the strangermay partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn and if anelder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on thespot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all suchfruits but he must carry away nothing if however he will notobey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time 
 water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easilypolluted you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun orthe air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divertthem or steal them but all these things may very likely happen inregard to water which must therefore be protected by law and letthis be the any one intentionally pollutes the water ofanother whether the water of a spring or collected in by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let theinjured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city andclaim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guiltyof injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not onlypay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification to be made by the offender in each case 
 with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let aman if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which heeither does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses now of these things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force inthe use which he makes of his own property all these matters a manshould lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposingthe injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a chargeagainst another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suitinto the public courts and have the punished but if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes inan unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injuredparty any one may bring the offences of magistrates in anyparticular case before the public courts there are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes of punishment and applicationsfor suits and summonses and the witnesses to two witnesses should be required for a summons or all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation butare beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator these lesser matters asthey indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a youngergeneration regulate by law after the patterns which have according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let therebe no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them 
 now of artisans let the regulations be as the firstplace let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied inhandicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public orderof the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds ofknowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintendingsome one else who is practising another let this then be ourfirst principle in the one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend art rather than his own under the pretext that insuperintending many servants who are working for him he is likelyto superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them than from his own art but let every man in the state haveone art and get his living by that let the wardens of the citylabour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any otherart than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace andinfamy until they bring him back into his own right course and ifany stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds andmoney penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel himto be one only and not many 
 but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to anyother up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide thecase but if greater amount be involved then let the public courtsdecide according to law let no one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come fromabroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry or the materials of any art which have to be imported andwhich are not one should import them nor again shouldany one export anything which is wanted in the country of all thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from theguardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order tothe five seniors concerning arms and all implements which are formilitary purposes if there be need of introducing any art orplant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war letthe commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation and exportation the city shall send them out and alsoreceive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws about them but let there be no retail trade for the sake either in these or any other articles in the city orcountry at all 
 with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of thecountry the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is thecustom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them let thetwelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to whichthe rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as theanimals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be dividedin due proportion into three parts one part for freemen anotherfor their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city andlike other men must live or those who come on some business whichthey have with the state or with some individual let only this thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the no one shall be compelled to sell and how will they bebest distributed in the first place we see clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point of view and in anotherpoint of view of unequals 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes thevarious articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse 
 cle of course 
 ath such being the case let no one of the three portions begreater than either of the other that which is assigned tomasters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he havingpower to determine the quantity and quality and what remains he shalldistribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained from the earth taking the whole number of them 
 in the second place our citizens should have separate houses dulyordered and this will be the order proper for men like them thereshall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth in each hamlet they shall first set apart a andthe temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if therebe any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancientdeities whose memory has been preserved to these let them paytheir ancient honours but hestia and zeus and athene will havetemples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of thetwelve districts and the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples where the ground is highest in order to provide thesafest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards all therest of the country they shall settle in the following make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shallestablish in the city and this again they shall subdivide intotwelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country round about andin each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with aview to the convenience of the husbandmen and the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters andsee how many of them and which class of them each place fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and mostuseful to the husbandman and the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar matters in the city 
 now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of theagora their first care after the temples which are in the agora havebeen seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any indealings between man and man in the second place as beinginspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him whorequires chastisement touching articles of gale they should firstsee whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains and let thelaw be as the first day of the month the persons incharge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have thecharge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers theportion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portionof the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month andother cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell and the other buy liquidssufficient to last during the whole month and on the daythere shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who want to buy and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either wovenor made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others as to the retail trade inthese things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the strangersell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retailtrade and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals to the strangers and artisans and their servants let anystranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from thosewho have the care of it in the country and let him sell to thestrangers as much he pleases and when he pleases as to other goodsand implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell themin common market at any place which the guardians of the law andthe wardens of the market and city choosing according to theirjudgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange moneyfor goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to theother and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtainhis money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected bylaw but whenever property has been bought or sold greater inquantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determinedwithin what limited a man may increase and diminish his the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the case of diminution let there be an erasure made and let thesame rule be observed about the registration of the property of themetics any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwellin the land but he must practise an art and not abide more thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered himself andhe shall pay no tax however small except good any other tax for buying and selling but when the twenty yearshave expired he shall take his property with him and depart and ifin the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and hethinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either togrant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city andwhatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect for thechildren of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year andlet them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but anyof them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade thecouncil and assembly and if he depart let him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the register kept by themagistrates

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors 
 cle very good 
 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors 
 cle very good 
 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another

 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety

 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety

 if man exchanges either money for money or anything whatever foranything else either with or without life let him give and receivethem genuine and unadulterated in accordance with the law and let ushave a prelude about all this sort of roguery like the preludes ofour other laws every man should regard adulteration as of one and thesame class with falsehood and deceit concerning which the many aretoo fond of saying that at proper times and places the practice mayoften be right but they leave the occasion and the when and thewhere undefined and unsettled and from this want of definitenessin their language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and toothers now a legislator ought not to leave the matter ought to prescribe some limit either greater or less let thisbe the rule one shall call the gods to witness when hesays or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest unless he wouldbe the most hateful of mankind to them and he is most hateful to themtakes a false oath and pays no heed to the gods and in the nextdegree he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors nowbetter men are the superiors of worse men and in general elders arethe superiors of the young wherefore also parents are the superiorsof their off spring and men of women and children and rulers oftheir subjects for all men ought to reverence any one who is in anyposition of authority and especially those who are in stateoffices and this is the reason why i have spoken of these every one who is guilty of adulteration in the agora tells afalsehood and deceives and when he invokes the gods according tothe customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora he does butswear without any respect for god or man certainly it is anexcellent rule not lightly to defile the names of the gods afterthe fashion of men in general who care little about piety andpurity in their religious actions but if a man will not conform tothis rule let the law be as who sells anything in theagora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells but he shallask one price and if he do not obtain this he shall take away hisgoods and on that day he shall not value them either at more or there shall be no praising of any goods or oath taken about a person disobeys this command any citizen who is present notbeing less than thirty years of age may with impunity chastise andbeat the swearer but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them if a mansells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations hewho knows and can prove the fact and does prove it in the presence ofthe magistrates if he be a slave or a metic shall have theadulterated goods but if he be a citizen and do not pursue thecharge he shall be called a rogue and deemed to have robbed the godsof the agora or if he proves the charge he shall dedicate thegoods to the gods of the agora he who is proved to have sold anyadulterated goods in addition to losing the goods themselves shallbe beaten with stripe for a drachma according to theprice of the goods and the herald shall proclaim in the agora theoffence for which he is going to be beaten the warden of the agoraand the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experiencedpersons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers andshall write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each let them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the courtof the wardens of the agora that they may be clear instructors ofthose who have business in the agora enough has been said in what haspreceded about the wardens of the city and if anything seems to bewanting let them communicate with the guardians of the law and writedown the omission and place on a column in the court of the wardensof the city the primary and secondary regulations which are laiddown for them about their office 
 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them 
 cle and what do you call the true mode of service 
 ath i will tell you o my friend for such things are worthlistening to 
 cle proceed 
 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods 
 cle excellent 
 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 if man exchanges either money for money or anything whatever foranything else either with or without life let him give and receivethem genuine and unadulterated in accordance with the law and let ushave a prelude about all this sort of roguery like the preludes ofour other laws every man should regard adulteration as of one and thesame class with falsehood and deceit concerning which the many aretoo fond of saying that at proper times and places the practice mayoften be right but they leave the occasion and the when and thewhere undefined and unsettled and from this want of definitenessin their language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and toothers now a legislator ought not to leave the matter ought to prescribe some limit either greater or less let thisbe the rule one shall call the gods to witness when hesays or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest unless he wouldbe the most hateful of mankind to them and he is most hateful to themtakes a false oath and pays no heed to the gods and in the nextdegree he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors nowbetter men are the superiors of worse men and in general elders arethe superiors of the young wherefore also parents are the superiorsof their off spring and men of women and children and rulers oftheir subjects for all men ought to reverence any one who is in anyposition of authority and especially those who are in stateoffices and this is the reason why i have spoken of these every one who is guilty of adulteration in the agora tells afalsehood and deceives and when he invokes the gods according tothe customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora he does butswear without any respect for god or man certainly it is anexcellent rule not lightly to defile the names of the gods afterthe fashion of men in general who care little about piety andpurity in their religious actions but if a man will not conform tothis rule let the law be as who sells anything in theagora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells but he shallask one price and if he do not obtain this he shall take away hisgoods and on that day he shall not value them either at more or there shall be no praising of any goods or oath taken about a person disobeys this command any citizen who is present notbeing less than thirty years of age may with impunity chastise andbeat the swearer but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them if a mansells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations hewho knows and can prove the fact and does prove it in the presence ofthe magistrates if he be a slave or a metic shall have theadulterated goods but if he be a citizen and do not pursue thecharge he shall be called a rogue and deemed to have robbed the godsof the agora or if he proves the charge he shall dedicate thegoods to the gods of the agora he who is proved to have sold anyadulterated goods in addition to losing the goods themselves shallbe beaten with stripe for a drachma according to theprice of the goods and the herald shall proclaim in the agora theoffence for which he is going to be beaten the warden of the agoraand the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experiencedpersons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers andshall write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each let them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the courtof the wardens of the agora that they may be clear instructors ofthose who have business in the agora enough has been said in what haspreceded about the wardens of the city and if anything seems to bewanting let them communicate with the guardians of the law and writedown the omission and place on a column in the court of the wardensof the city the primary and secondary regulations which are laiddown for them about their office 
 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them 
 cle and what do you call the true mode of service 
 ath i will tell you o my friend for such things are worthlistening to 
 cle proceed 
 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods

 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our cityto any other or bring back a false message from the city to whichhe is sent or be proved to have brought back whether from friends orenemies in his capacity of herald or ambassador what they have neversaid let him be indicted for having violated contrary to the commands and duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus and letthere be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he beconvicted 
 theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sonsof zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when hethieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base butonly what the gods themselves do for such tales are untrue andimprobable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is nevereither a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed than all the poets put together happy is he andmay he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our he who disobeys shall have to contend against the a man steal anything belonging to the public whether thatwhich he steals be much or little he shall have the samepunishment for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greateramount not having deposited it is wholly unjust wherefore the lawis not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the otherbecause his theft is less but on the ground that the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable and may in another case beincurable if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing inmind that he is probably not incurable but the citizen who has beenbrought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty ofrobbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught inthe act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable 
 now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws arerequired the great principle of all is that no one of either sexshould be without a commander nor should the mind of any one beaccustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his ownmotion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow hisleader even in the least things being under his guidance forexample he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take hismeals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word notteach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart from others of all soldiers the life should bealways and in all things as far as possible in common and neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or morescientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory in war and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded byothers anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts who are subject to man i may add that all dances ought to beperformed with view to military excellence and agility and easeshould be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of thewant of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and ofhard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles for these are the extremities and of all the parts ofthe body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the otherthe master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set let theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises ofthe military life the law shall be as shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and ifany one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of thegenerals he shall be indicted before the military commanders forfailure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall behis judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms ofthe service shall form separate courts and they shall bring before the and the horsemen before thehorsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he whois found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize ofvalour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be anaccuser at all in any military matters moreover the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penaltyhe shall pay when the suits for failure of service are completed theleaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shallgive judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing aboutany former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirmhis statement but speaking only of the present occasion the crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up thetemple of any whom he likes adding an inscription for atestimony to last during life that such an one has received thefirst the second or prize if any one goes on an expedition andreturns home before the appointed time when the generals have notwithdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he befound guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him 
 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations 
 when a man becomes surety let him give the security in a distinctform acknowledging the whole transaction in a written document andin the presence of not less than three witnesses if the sum be under athousand drachmae and of not less than five witnesses if the sum beabove a thousand drachmae the agent of a dishonest or untrustworthyseller shall himself be responsible both the agent and theprincipal shall be equally liable if a person wishes to find anythingin the house of another he shall enter naked or wearing only a shorttunic and without a girdle having first taken an oath by thecustomary gods that he expects to find it there he shall then makehis search and the other shall throw open his house and allow himto search things both sealed and unsealed and if a person will notallow the searcher to make his search he who is prevented shall go tolaw with him estimating the value of the goods after which he issearching and if the other be convicted he shall pay twice thevalue of the article if the master be absent from home thedwellers in the house shall let him search the unsealed on the sealed property the searcher shall set another seal andshall appoint any one whom he likes to guard them during five if the master of the house be absent during a longer time heshall take with him the wardens of the city and so make his the sealed property as well as the unsealed and with the members of the family and the wardens of the shall seal them up again as they were before there shall be alimit of time in the case of disputed things and he who has hadpossession of them during a certain time shall no longer be liableto be disturbed as to houses and lands there can be no dispute inthis state of ours but if a man has any other possessions which hehas used and openly shown in the city and in the agora and in thetemples and no one has put in a claim to them and some one says thathe was looking for them during this time and the possessor isproved to have made no concealment if they have continued for a one having the goods and the other looking for them the claimof the seeker shall not be allowed after the expiration of the if he does not use or show the lost property in the market or inthe city but only in the country and no one offers himself as theowner during five years at the expiration of the five years the claimshall be barred for ever after or if he uses them in the city butwithin the house then the appointed time of claiming the goodsshall be three years or ten years if he has them in the country inprivate and if he has them in another land there shall be no limitof time or prescription but whenever the owner finds them he mayclaim them

 if any one knowingly receives anything which has been stolen heshall undergo the same punishment as the thief and if a manreceives an exile he shall be punished with death every man shouldregard the friend and enemy of the state as his own friend andenemy and if any one makes peace or war with another on his ownaccount and without the authority of the state he like the receiverof the exile shall undergo the penalty of death and if anyfraction of the city declare war or peace against any the generalsshall indict the authors of this proceeding and if they are convicteddeath shall be the penalty those who serve their country ought toserve without receiving gifts and there ought to be no excusing orapproving the saying men should receive gifts as the reward of not of evil deeds for to know which we are doing and to standfast by our knowledge is no easy matter the safest course is to obeythe law which says do no service for a bribe and let him whodisobeys if he be convicted simply die with a view to taxation forvarious reasons every man ought to have had his property the tribesmen should likewise bring a register of the yearlyproduce to the wardens of the country that in this way there may betwo valuations and the public officers may use annuary whichever onconsideration they deem the best whether they prefer to take acertain portion of the whole value or of the annual revenue aftersubtracting what is paid to the common tables 
 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim

 if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our cityto any other or bring back a false message from the city to whichhe is sent or be proved to have brought back whether from friends orenemies in his capacity of herald or ambassador what they have neversaid let him be indicted for having violated contrary to the commands and duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus and letthere be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he beconvicted 
 theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sonsof zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when hethieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base butonly what the gods themselves do for such tales are untrue andimprobable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is nevereither a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed than all the poets put together happy is he andmay he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our he who disobeys shall have to contend against the a man steal anything belonging to the public whether thatwhich he steals be much or little he shall have the samepunishment for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greateramount not having deposited it is wholly unjust wherefore the lawis not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the otherbecause his theft is less but on the ground that the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable and may in another case beincurable if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing inmind that he is probably not incurable but the citizen who has beenbrought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty ofrobbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught inthe act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable 
 now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws arerequired the great principle of all is that no one of either sexshould be without a commander nor should the mind of any one beaccustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his ownmotion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow hisleader even in the least things being under his guidance forexample he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take hismeals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word notteach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart from others of all soldiers the life should bealways and in all things as far as possible in common and neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or morescientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory in war and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded byothers anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts who are subject to man i may add that all dances ought to beperformed with view to military excellence and agility and easeshould be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of thewant of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and ofhard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles for these are the extremities and of all the parts ofthe body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the otherthe master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set let theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises ofthe military life the law shall be as shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and ifany one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of thegenerals he shall be indicted before the military commanders forfailure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall behis judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms ofthe service shall form separate courts and they shall bring before the and the horsemen before thehorsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he whois found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize ofvalour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be anaccuser at all in any military matters moreover the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penaltyhe shall pay when the suits for failure of service are completed theleaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shallgive judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing aboutany former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirmhis statement but speaking only of the present occasion the crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up thetemple of any whom he likes adding an inscription for atestimony to last during life that such an one has received thefirst the second or prize if any one goes on an expedition andreturns home before the appointed time when the generals have notwithdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he befound guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him 
 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations

 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim 
 meg i will

 if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between and annette scherer 
 heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa 
 first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned 
 can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the whole evening i hope 
 and the fete at the english today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for me to take me there 
 i thought fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome 
 if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed 
 tease well and what has been decided about dispatch you know everything 
 what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours 
 prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct 
 in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out 
 oh speak to me of austria perhaps i understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe 
 she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity 
 i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea 
 in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard 
 i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature 
 prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron 
 anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with 
 baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone 
 as she named the empress anna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup and again her face clouded over with sadness 
 the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said 
 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful 
 the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 
 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile 
 i help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity 
 joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her and you were pitied 
 the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned 
 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant 
 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively 
 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped 
 he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated 
 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya 
 prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information 
 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich 
 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an of and will be here tonight 
 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
 attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid

 i have just returned from a visit to my solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with this is certainly a beautiful country in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society a perfect heaven and mr heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us a capital fellow he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as i announced my name 
 mr heathcliff i said 
 a nod was the answer 
 mr lockwood your new tenant sir i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts 
 thrushcross grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing i should not allow anyone to inconvenience me if i could hinder in 
 the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself 
 when he saw my breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court joseph take mr horse and bring up some wine 
 here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order 
 no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only 
 joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy the lord help us he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent 
 wuthering heights is the name of mr dwelling wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones 
 before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date and the name hareton earnshaw i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium 
 one step brought us into the family without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof the latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses 
 the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner but mr heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living he is a gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of pride i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of manifestations of mutual kindliness love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again no running on too fast i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him mr heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a acquaintance to those which actuate me let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one 
 while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a sweetest of all imaginable looks and what did i do i confess it with icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate 
 i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl 
 better let the dog alone growled mr heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot not accustomed to be kept for a pet then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph 
 joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us this proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre i felt my heels and peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in peace 
 mr heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with gown bare arms and cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene 
 what the devil is the matter he asked eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment 
 what the devil indeed i muttered the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers 
 they meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table the dogs do right to be vigilant take a glass of wine 
 no thank you 
 not bitten are you 
 if i had been i would have set my signet on the biter 
 countenance relaxed into a grin 
 come come he said you are flurried mr lockwood here take a little wine guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs i am willing to own hardly know how to receive them your health sir 
 i bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides i felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before i went home i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion i shall go notwithstanding it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him

 joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us this proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre i felt my heels and peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in peace 
 mr heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with gown bare arms and cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene 
 what the devil is the matter he asked eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment 
 what the devil indeed i muttered the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers 
 they meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table the dogs do right to be vigilant take a glass of wine 
 no thank you 
 not bitten are you 
 if i had been i would have set my signet on the biter 
 countenance relaxed into a grin 
 come come he said you are flurried mr lockwood here take a little wine guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs i am willing to own hardly know how to receive them your health sir 
 i bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides i felt loath to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since the humour took that turn swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before i went home i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit tomorrow he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion i shall go notwithstanding it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him

 chapter one 
 
 christmas be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug 
 so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress 
 i think fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner 
 the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we got father and shall not have him for a long time she say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was 
 nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted 
 but i think the little we should spend would do any good each got a dollar and the army be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm 
 i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder 
 i shall get a nice box of drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly 
 mother say anything about our money and she wish us to give up everything each buy what we want and have a little fun sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner 
 i know i those tiresome children nearly all day when longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again 
 you have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till you ready to fly out the window or cry 
 naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time 
 i believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he rich and insult you when your nose nice 
 if you mean libel say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing 
 i know what i mean and you be statirical about it proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity 
 peck at one another children you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times 
 you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money 
 so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say 
 jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug 
 o immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle 
 jo so boyish 
 why i do it 
 i detest rude unladylike girls 
 i hate affected chits 
 birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time 
 really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady 
 not and if turning up my hair makes me one wear it in two tails till twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like games and work and manners i get over my disappointment in not being a boy and worse than ever now for dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman 
 and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room 
 poor jo too bad but it be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch 
 as for you amy continued meg you are altogether to particular and prim your airs are funny now but grow up an affected little goose if you take care i i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as slang 
 if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture 
 a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family 
 as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it 
 margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteen jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smooth haired girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out 
 the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze 
 they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair 
 i thought get her some with my dollar said beth 
 no i shall cried amy 
 the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone 
 tell you what do said beth each get her something for christmas land not get anything for ourselves 
 like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo 
 everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves 
 army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth 
 get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it cost much so have some left to buy my pencils added amy 
 how will we give the things asked meg 
 put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo 
 i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time 
 let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air 
 i mean to act any more after this time getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about frolics 
 you stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear jewelryyou are the best actress got and be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that 
 i help it i never saw anyone faint and i choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily drop if i i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece 
 do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling 
 amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs blame me come on meg 
 then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha 
 the best had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows 
 i see how you can write and act such splendid things jo a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things 
 not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but like to try mcbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do 
 no the toasting fork with shoe on it instead of the bread cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter 
 glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world 
 well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i come home to dinner has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby 
 while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded 
 as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face got a treat for you after supper 
 a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father 
 yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there 
 hurry and get done stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat 
 beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready 
 i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly 
 i wish i could go as a drummer a its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan 
 it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy 
 when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice 
 not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter 
 they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the heart with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home 
 give them all of my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but truly try to be better so he be disappointed in me 
 we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but any more if i can help it 
 try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south 
 beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home 
 mrs march broke the silence that followed words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city 
 what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the were said jo 
 i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg 
 i remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i too old for such things rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve 
 we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another out burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home 
 really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady 
 each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she got any said her mother 
 yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people 
 bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much 
 let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good hard work and we forget and do our best 
 we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty 
 look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march 
 they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them 
 at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang meg had a voice like a flute and she and herr mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp 
 crinkle crinkle ittle tar and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby

 beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready 
 i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly 
 i wish i could go as a drummer a its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan 
 it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy 
 when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice 
 not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter 
 they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the heart with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home 
 give them all of my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but truly try to be better so he be disappointed in me 
 we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but any more if i can help it 
 try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south 
 beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home 
 mrs march broke the silence that followed words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city 
 what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the were said jo 
 i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg 
 i remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i too old for such things rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve 
 we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another out burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home 
 really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady 
 each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she got any said her mother 
 yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people 
 bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much 
 let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good hard work and we forget and do our best 
 we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty 
 look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march 
 they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them 
 at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang meg had a voice like a flute and she and herr mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp 
 crinkle crinkle ittle tar and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby

 organs removed and placed in sacred canopic 
 jars 
 imhotep filled with dread reads from a obooko made out of pure gold this 
 is the book of the living 
 imhotep 
 the book of the living contained 
 sacred incantations that would send the evil 
 dead on a journey into the dark underworld 
 strange light suddenly flashes across body and across the 
 faces of the slaves and the egyptian soldiers suddenly 
 eyes all rise as if watching body rising then 
 one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and over 
 body now lies twisted on the ground 
 priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus the nubian 
 slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand imhotep then signals to 
 the soldiers who throw their spears at the nubians killing them 
 inhotep 
 
 the slaves were killed 
 priests attack the now unarmed soldiers hacking 
 at them in the flickering darkness as imhotep and the mumia solemnly 
 watches 
 imhotep 
 and the soldiers who killed them 
 were also slain so that no unholy person 
 should ever know the exact location of the 
 burial site 
 the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one 
 the priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
 vanishing mumia as the last mumia disappears over a distant 
 dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto 
 grave and begin digging it back up with their hands 
 ext sahara desert night 
 chariots race out into the moonlit desert imhotep leads the way a 
 hearse carries mummy the map of ancient egypt fades up 
 the chariots race across the map 
 imhotep 
 but there was another book the book 
 of the dead which was never opened 
 never to be read for it contained the 
 incantations that could bring a dead body 
 back to life a most unholy thing 
 the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic they race up 
 the stone ramp and in through the city gates superimposed across the 
 screen are the words 
 kanunaptm city of the dead 
 imhotep 
 it was hidden at hamunaptra city of 
 the dead inside the statue of anubis so 
 that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace 
 egypt 
 ext hamunaptra anubis site night 
 imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment inside the giant 
 statue of anubis he opens the chest and lifts out the book of the dead 
 made of black stone 
 imhotep 
 but for my love of i 
 was willing to defy the gods 
 int underground necropolis night 
 big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of 
 this very large scary underground cemetery a detritus moat surrounds the 
 cemetery muck made out of filthy water and human remains skulls bob in 
 the goop the priests have gathered in a circle their hooded lifeless 
 eyes seem dead to this world their bald heads rock back and forth as they 
 chant a quiet eerie hum heinous creatures in the middle of the circle is 
 a strange twisted altar imhotep has unwrapped gorgeous 
 lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her 
 imhotep 
 vital organs were 
 still fresh so a human sacrifice would not 
 need be made 
 as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large swirling hole 
 starts to open in the detritus bog several priests look over at it 
 frightened then quickly look back down and resume chanting a strange mist 
 wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through 
 them and into body one of the jars shudders the heart 
 inside begins to beat the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist 
 beating heart and readings are reaching a crescendo 
 eyes suddenly fly open 
 imhotep 
 soul had come back from 
 the dead now all that was needed was to 
 return her organs to their rightful place 
 within her body 
 imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above breast about to 
 plunge it down the chanting swirling and beating heart climax and 
 when the mumia burst in and storm through the startled priests the head 
 mumia smashes the jar with the beating heart the mist instantly sucks back 
 out of body and implodes back into the swirling hole 
 eyes close dying once again imhotep screams in rage the 
 mumia grab him and his priests 
 imhotep 
 my priests were condemned to be 
 mummified alive 
 int chamber necropolis night 
 inside a chamber imhotep is held by embalmers he 
 cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being 
 embalmed and mummified alive the embalmers using knives 
 needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
 priests who are going insane from the procedure 
 a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals 
 a head is wedged between two strong boards his eyes widen in 
 terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose but 
 just before he does we quickly cut to face horrified as off 
 camera the priest screams 
 we go wide on the chamber all of priests squirm 
 inside their wrappings imhotep is forced to his knees his arms are held 
 back his mouth is pried open 
 imhotep 
 as for me i was condemned to endure 
 the the worst of all ancient curses 
 one so horrible it had never before been 
 bestowed 
 using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls tongue out of his 
 mouth then places a very sharp knife on top of it tight on 
 eyes as his tongue is apparently cut out the embalmer flings 
 tongue onto the floor the dogs attack and quickly eat 
 it 
 imhotep is wrapped al m only his mouth nostrils and eyes are 
 left free of the slimy bandages detritus muck boils inside a black 
 cauldron embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to 
 wrappings as he squirms then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone 
 sarcophagus an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin 
 wild eyes stare back the embalmer empties the bucket over 
 chest dozens of scarabs disgusting dung beetles they scurry 
 across screaming face some vanish into his mouth 
 and up his nostrils 
 inhotep 
 by eating the sacred scarabs i would 
 be cursed to stay alive forever and by 
 eating me they were cursed just the same 
 the lid to the coffin is slammed shut then using a strange 
 ycey the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight the heavy sarcophagus lid 
 is shoved into place and with a loud whoosh seals itself airtight once 
 again the head mumia uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid 
 tight 
 imhotep 
 i was to remain sealed inside my 
 sarcophagus the undead for all of eternity 
 the strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of 
 the key turning it into a little puzzle box 
 inhotep 
 they would never allow me to be 
 released for i would arise a walking 
 disease a plague upon mankind an unholy 
 with the strength of ages power 
 over the sands and the glory of 
 invincibility 
 sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit the disgusting muck 
 splashes up drools down sides and then is mysteriously sucked into 
 seams vanishing clean 
 inhotep 
 and if i could raise my beloved 
 from her place in hell 
 together we would be an unstoppable 
 infection upon this world the apocalypse 
 the end 
 horrifying screans can be heard coming from inside 
 his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it the main title is 
 superimposed on the scream the mummy 
 the heavily armed mumia stand guard around grave looking down on 
 the burial site is the huge statue of anubis the god of 
 death it stares at us then begins to decay before bur very eyes aging 
 years in only seconds and then we find ourselves and the decrepit 
 statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert 
 ext sahara hamanaptra ruins day 
 horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg horseman 
 racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren armed 
 to the teeth superimposed across the screen are the words tee sarkra 
 
 a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires 
 scurry through the ruins preparing for the onslaught our hero is up on 
 the wall his kepi sits at a jaunty angle dashing and handsome this is 
 rick he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at 
 him 
 
 i knew this was gonna be a lousy day 
 a doughy little frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of 
 the wall this is beni 
 beni 
 personally i would like to surrender 
 why can we not just surrender 
 
 and gimme your bandolier 
 beni pulls off his cartridge belt hands it to 
 beni 
 then run away right now while we 
 can still make it 
 throws it on crisscrossing his own bandolier 
 
 now gimme your revolver 
 never use it anyway 
 beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to 
 beni 
 then play dead huh nobody ever 
 does that anymore 
 slides it into his belt next to his own revolver 
 
 now go find me a big stick 
 beni 
 in the desert what for 
 turns and goes with him 
 
 so i can tie it to your back you 
 appear to be without a spine 
 the horde of warriors thunders forward now a half mile out scimitars 
 rattling and beni run through the ruins 
 
 a guy like you end up in the 
 legion anyways 
 beni 
 i got caught robbing a synagogue lots 
 of good stuff in them holy places churches 
 temples mosques and guarding them 
 
 altar boys 
 beni 
 exactly i speak seven languages 
 including hebrew so my specialty was 
 synagogues how about you kill somebody 
 beni trips and accidentally tackles to the ground 
 gives him a nasty look 
 
 no but considering it 
 they get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp 
 beni 
 what then robbery extortion 
 kidnapping 
 
 none of the above thank you 
 beni 
 then what the hell are you 
 doing here 
 they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of 
 sound of charging horses is deafening gives beni a 
 big cheesy smile 
 
 i was just looking for a good time 
 and when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics cuts and 
 runs instantly stiffens 
 
 oh shit steady 
 gives the men around him courage but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding 
 the sand several more legionnaires take off 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i sayin 
 the tuaregs let loose with those horrifying screams more 
 legionnaires beni is one of them 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i doin 
 the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim steels himself cocks 
 and locks the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps he spits it into the 
 sand another beat and then 
 
 fire 
 the legionnaires on the ground fire the rifles report with a crash the 
 blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts the prone 
 legionnaires quickly begin to reload 
 
 fire 
 the kneeling legionnaires fire more tuaregs bite the sand the remaining 
 warriors open fire thunder and smoke rip the hot air a third of the 
 legionnaires are killed instantly 
 
 fire 
 the remaining standing legionnaires fire tuaregs spin off their mounts 
 crash to the sand and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins 
 and through the legionnaires grabs the barrel of his rifle and 
 starts clubbing riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed 
 beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand whimpering in 
 full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him he crawls through 
 the front gate 
 throws his rifle down and goes for his guns he gun 
 in each hand starts blowing riders off their mounts 
 beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the 
 rocks he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires 
 are shot off their feet behind him guns go empty 
 
 
 he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate four tuareg 
 warriors on massive arabians after him hurdles a stone 
 column hits the ground running he spots beni inside the temple doorway 
 trying to close the heavy sandstone door 
 
 hey beni wait up 
 beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder 
 
 what are ya doing wait up 
 runs faster beni pushes harder the four horsemen leap the big 
 column and charge after him hoofs pounding 
 
 you close that door 
 you close trat door 
 beni closes the door just as reaches it slams his body 
 into the door it budge 
 
 gonna get you for this 
 he turns and bolts off around the rocks running for his life weaving 
 through the ruins the arabians getting closer and closer the pounding 
 hoofs getting louder and louder finally spins around and faces 
 his attackers the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him 
 the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off just 
 stands there exhausted and beaten then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird 
 and when the horses go all four of them rear up two of 
 the riders are thrown to the ground the horses screech and bellow and 
 snort in fear then buck like fury and away as if the devil 
 himself had scared them the thrown riders get up and race off after their 
 mounts 
 just stands there stunned then he lifts his right hand and 
 checks out his middle finger and then he feels the evil himself and turns 
 around the shattered decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him 
 suddenly the sand begins to shift under feet he starts to 
 back away keeping his eyes on the transforming sand it looks like huge 
 snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it forming lines and shapes 
 drawing a picture quickly turns and runs off through the 
 ruins the sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the sand 
 is a picture of screaming face

 eyes close dying once again imhotep screams in rage the 
 mumia grab him and his priests 
 imhotep 
 my priests were condemned to be 
 mummified alive 
 int chamber necropolis night 
 inside a chamber imhotep is held by embalmers he 
 cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being 
 embalmed and mummified alive the embalmers using knives 
 needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
 priests who are going insane from the procedure 
 a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals 
 a head is wedged between two strong boards his eyes widen in 
 terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose but 
 just before he does we quickly cut to face horrified as off 
 camera the priest screams 
 we go wide on the chamber all of priests squirm 
 inside their wrappings imhotep is forced to his knees his arms are held 
 back his mouth is pried open 
 imhotep 
 as for me i was condemned to endure 
 the the worst of all ancient curses 
 one so horrible it had never before been 
 bestowed 
 using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls tongue out of his 
 mouth then places a very sharp knife on top of it tight on 
 eyes as his tongue is apparently cut out the embalmer flings 
 tongue onto the floor the dogs attack and quickly eat 
 it 
 imhotep is wrapped al m only his mouth nostrils and eyes are 
 left free of the slimy bandages detritus muck boils inside a black 
 cauldron embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to 
 wrappings as he squirms then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone 
 sarcophagus an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin 
 wild eyes stare back the embalmer empties the bucket over 
 chest dozens of scarabs disgusting dung beetles they scurry 
 across screaming face some vanish into his mouth 
 and up his nostrils 
 inhotep 
 by eating the sacred scarabs i would 
 be cursed to stay alive forever and by 
 eating me they were cursed just the same 
 the lid to the coffin is slammed shut then using a strange 
 ycey the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight the heavy sarcophagus lid 
 is shoved into place and with a loud whoosh seals itself airtight once 
 again the head mumia uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid 
 tight 
 imhotep 
 i was to remain sealed inside my 
 sarcophagus the undead for all of eternity 
 the strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of 
 the key turning it into a little puzzle box 
 inhotep 
 they would never allow me to be 
 released for i would arise a walking 
 disease a plague upon mankind an unholy 
 with the strength of ages power 
 over the sands and the glory of 
 invincibility 
 sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit the disgusting muck 
 splashes up drools down sides and then is mysteriously sucked into 
 seams vanishing clean 
 inhotep 
 and if i could raise my beloved 
 from her place in hell 
 together we would be an unstoppable 
 infection upon this world the apocalypse 
 the end 
 horrifying screans can be heard coming from inside 
 his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it the main title is 
 superimposed on the scream the mummy 
 the heavily armed mumia stand guard around grave looking down on 
 the burial site is the huge statue of anubis the god of 
 death it stares at us then begins to decay before bur very eyes aging 
 years in only seconds and then we find ourselves and the decrepit 
 statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert 
 ext sahara hamanaptra ruins day 
 horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg horseman 
 racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren armed 
 to the teeth superimposed across the screen are the words tee sarkra 
 
 a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires 
 scurry through the ruins preparing for the onslaught our hero is up on 
 the wall his kepi sits at a jaunty angle dashing and handsome this is 
 rick he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at 
 him 
 
 i knew this was gonna be a lousy day 
 a doughy little frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of 
 the wall this is beni 
 beni 
 personally i would like to surrender 
 why can we not just surrender 
 
 and gimme your bandolier 
 beni pulls off his cartridge belt hands it to 
 beni 
 then run away right now while we 
 can still make it 
 throws it on crisscrossing his own bandolier 
 
 now gimme your revolver 
 never use it anyway 
 beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to 
 beni 
 then play dead huh nobody ever 
 does that anymore 
 slides it into his belt next to his own revolver 
 
 now go find me a big stick 
 beni 
 in the desert what for 
 turns and goes with him 
 
 so i can tie it to your back you 
 appear to be without a spine 
 the horde of warriors thunders forward now a half mile out scimitars 
 rattling and beni run through the ruins 
 
 a guy like you end up in the 
 legion anyways 
 beni 
 i got caught robbing a synagogue lots 
 of good stuff in them holy places churches 
 temples mosques and guarding them 
 
 altar boys 
 beni 
 exactly i speak seven languages 
 including hebrew so my specialty was 
 synagogues how about you kill somebody 
 beni trips and accidentally tackles to the ground 
 gives him a nasty look 
 
 no but considering it 
 they get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp 
 beni 
 what then robbery extortion 
 kidnapping 
 
 none of the above thank you 
 beni 
 then what the hell are you 
 doing here 
 they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of 
 sound of charging horses is deafening gives beni a 
 big cheesy smile 
 
 i was just looking for a good time 
 and when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics cuts and 
 runs instantly stiffens 
 
 oh shit steady 
 gives the men around him courage but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding 
 the sand several more legionnaires take off 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i sayin 
 the tuaregs let loose with those horrifying screams more 
 legionnaires beni is one of them 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i doin 
 the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim steels himself cocks 
 and locks the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps he spits it into the 
 sand another beat and then 
 
 fire 
 the legionnaires on the ground fire the rifles report with a crash the 
 blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts the prone 
 legionnaires quickly begin to reload 
 
 fire 
 the kneeling legionnaires fire more tuaregs bite the sand the remaining 
 warriors open fire thunder and smoke rip the hot air a third of the 
 legionnaires are killed instantly 
 
 fire 
 the remaining standing legionnaires fire tuaregs spin off their mounts 
 crash to the sand and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins 
 and through the legionnaires grabs the barrel of his rifle and 
 starts clubbing riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed 
 beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand whimpering in 
 full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him he crawls through 
 the front gate 
 throws his rifle down and goes for his guns he gun 
 in each hand starts blowing riders off their mounts 
 beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the 
 rocks he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires 
 are shot off their feet behind him guns go empty 
 
 
 he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate four tuareg 
 warriors on massive arabians after him hurdles a stone 
 column hits the ground running he spots beni inside the temple doorway 
 trying to close the heavy sandstone door 
 
 hey beni wait up 
 beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder 
 
 what are ya doing wait up 
 runs faster beni pushes harder the four horsemen leap the big 
 column and charge after him hoofs pounding 
 
 you close that door 
 you close trat door 
 beni closes the door just as reaches it slams his body 
 into the door it budge 
 
 gonna get you for this 
 he turns and bolts off around the rocks running for his life weaving 
 through the ruins the arabians getting closer and closer the pounding 
 hoofs getting louder and louder finally spins around and faces 
 his attackers the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him 
 the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off just 
 stands there exhausted and beaten then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird 
 and when the horses go all four of them rear up two of 
 the riders are thrown to the ground the horses screech and bellow and 
 snort in fear then buck like fury and away as if the devil 
 himself had scared them the thrown riders get up and race off after their 
 mounts 
 just stands there stunned then he lifts his right hand and 
 checks out his middle finger and then he feels the evil himself and turns 
 around the shattered decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him 
 suddenly the sand begins to shift under feet he starts to 
 back away keeping his eyes on the transforming sand it looks like huge 
 snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it forming lines and shapes 
 drawing a picture quickly turns and runs off through the 
 ruins the sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the sand 
 is a picture of screaming face

 int jail cell day 
 extreme on a drop of water gathering at the tip ofa faucet a flash of light refracting through it just before it falls 
 pulling back slowly we see another drop of water gather andfall and then another into a metal sink basin filled with water rippling in concentric circles with each drop which we hear in a steady rhythm drip drip drip 
 ricky in time to the water fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 reverse angle on the face of a young man with his hair cutshort watching the dripping water as if hypnotized we zoom slowly toward him 
 this is ricky fitts twenty but his eyes are much older underneath his tranquility lurks something wounded and dangerous he sings softly to himself 
 ricky stops my mind from wandering 
 through the bars of his cell we see ricky is seated on theedge of a solitary cot in a jail cell staring intently at the metal sink on the wall across from him 
 ricky it will go

 into the primitive 
 
 
 old longings nomadic leap 
 chafing at chain 
 again from its brumal sleep 
 wakens the ferine strain 
 
 buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tidewater dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from puget sound to san diego because men groping in the arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the northland these men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost 
 buck lived at a big house in the santa clara valley judge place it was called it stood back from the road among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides the house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front there were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of servants cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where judge boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon 
 and over this great demesne buck ruled here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life it was true there were other dogs there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count they came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots the japanese pug or ysabel the mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground on the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops 
 but buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog the whole realm was his he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the sons he escorted mollie and alice the daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles on wintry nights he lay at the feet before the roaring library fire he carried the grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches among the terriers he stalked imperiously and toots and ysabel he utterly ignored for he was over all creeping crawling flying things of judge place humans included 
 his father elmo a huge st bernard had been the inseparable companion and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father he was not so weighed only one hundred and forty his mother she had been a scotch shepherd dog nevertheless one hundred and forty pounds to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat he had a fine pride in himself was even a trifle egotistical as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles and to him as to the races the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver 
 and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of when the klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north but buck did not read the newspapers and he did not know that manuel one of the helpers was an undesirable acquaintance manuel had one besetting sin he loved to play chinese lottery also in his gambling he had one besetting in a system and this made his damnation certain for to play a system requires money while the wages of a helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny 
 the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers association and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club on the memorable night of treachery no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard on what buck imagined was merely a stroll and with the exception of a solitary man no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as college park this man talked with manuel and money chinked between them 
 you might wrap up the goods before you deliver them the stranger said gruffly and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around neck under the collar 
 twist it and choke him plenty said manuel and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative 
 buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity to be sure it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own but when the ends of the rope were placed in the hands he growled menacingly he had merely intimated his displeasure in his pride believing that to intimate was to command but to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck shutting off his breath in a quick rage he sprang at the man who met him halfway grappled him close by the throat and with a deft twist threw him over on his back then the rope tightened mercilessly while buck struggled in a fury his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely never in all his life had he been so vilely treated and never in all his life had he been so angry but his strength ebbed his eyes glazed and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car 
 the next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance the hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was he had traveled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car he opened his eyes and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnaped king the man sprang for his throat but buck was too quick for him his jaws closed on the hand nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more 
 yep has fits the man said hiding his mangled hand from the baggage man who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle taking him up for the boss to frisco a crack dog doctor there thinks that he can cure him 
 concerning that ride the man spoke most eloquently for himself in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water front 
 all i get is fifty for it he grumbled and i do it over for a thousand cold cash 
 his hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle 
 how much did the other mug get the demanded 
 a hundred was the reply take a sou less so help me 
 that makes a hundred and fifty the calculated and worth it or a squarehead 
 the kidnaper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand if i get hydrophobia 
 be because you was born to hang laughed the here lend me a hand before you pull your freight he added 
 dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him buck attempted to face his tormentors but he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck then the rope was removed and he was flung into a crate 
 there he lay for the remainder of the weary night nursing his wrath and wounded pride he could not understand what it all meant what did they want with him these strange men why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate he did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the judge or the boys at least but each time it was the bulging face of the that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle and each time the joyful bark that trembled in throat was twisted into a savage growl 
 but the let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate more tormentors buck decided for they were creatures ragged and unkempt and he stormed and raged at them through the bars they only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that was what they wanted whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands clerks in the express office took charge of him he was carted about in another wagon a truck carried him with an assortment of boxes and parcels upon a ferry steamer he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car 
 for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank in his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him when he flung himself against the bars quivering and frothing they laughed at him and taunted him they growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed it was all very silly he knew but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed he did not mind the hunger so much but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to for that matter and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue 
 he was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck that had given them an unfair advantage but now that it was off he would show them they would never get another rope around his neck upon that he was resolved for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him his eyes turned bloodshot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend so changed was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at seattle 
 four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small back yard a stout man with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck came out and signed the book for the driver that was the man buck divined the next tormentor and he hurled himself savagely against the bars the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club 
 you going to take him out now the driver asked 
 sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry 
 there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance 
 buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out 
 now you devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of body at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand 
 and buck was truly a devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights in just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip he whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side he had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground this time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution a dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down 
 after a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush he staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose all the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this with a roar that was almost in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man but the man shifting the club from right to left cooly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest 
 for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless 
 no slouch at what i say one of the men on the wall cried with enthusiasm 
 druther break cayuses any day and twice on sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses 
 senses came back to him but not his strength he lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater 
 answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all will go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog and whale the stuffing outa you understand 
 as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest when the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chuck by chunk from the hand 
 he was beaten he knew that but he was not broken he saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club he had learned the lesson and in all his afterlife he never forgot it that club was a revelation it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect and while he faced that aspect uncowed he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused as the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come and one and all he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated of this last buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery 
 now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater and at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them buck wondered where they went for they never came back but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected 
 yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck could not understand 
 sacredam he cried when his eyes lit upon buck dat one dam bully dog eh how much 
 three hundred and a present at that was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater and seeing government money you got no kick coming eh perrault 
 perrault grinned considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal the canadian government would be no loser nor would its dispatches travel the slower perrault knew dogs when he looked at buck he knew that he was one in a in ten thousand he commented mentally 
 buck saw money pass between them and was not surprised when curly a newfoundland and he were led away by the little weazened man that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater and as curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal it was the last he saw of the warm southland curly and he were taken below by perrault and turned over to a giant called francois perrault was a french canadian and swarthy but francois was a french canadian and twice as swarthy they were a new kind of men to buck of which he was destined to see many more and while he developed no affection for them he none the less grew honestly to respect them he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair men calm and impartial in administering justice and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs 
 in the of the narwhal buck and curly joined two other dogs one of them was a big fellow from spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain and who had later accompanied a geological survey into the barrens 
 he was friendly in a treacherous sort of way smiling into face the while he meditated some underhand trick as for instance when he stole from food at the first meal as buck sprang to punish him the lash of whip sang through the air reaching the culprit first and nothing remained to buck but to recover the bone that was fair of francois he decided and the began his rise in estimation 
 the other dog made no advances nor received any also he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers he was a gloomy morose fellow ant he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone and further that there would be trouble if he were not left alone dave he was called and he ate and slept or yawned between times and took interest in nothing not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed when buck and curly grew excited with fear he raised his head as though annoyed favored them with an incurious glance yawned and went to sleep again 
 day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller and though one day was very like another it was apparent to buck that the weather was steadily growing colder at last one morning the propeller was quiet and the narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement he felt it as did the other dogs and knew that a change was at hand francois leashed them and brought them on deck at the first step upon the cold surface feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud he sprang back with a snort more of this white stuff was falling through the air he shook himself but more of it fell upon him he sniffed it curiously then licked some up on his tongue it bit like fire and the next instant was gone this puzzled him he tried it again with the same results the onlookers laughed uproariously and he felt ashamed he knew not why for it was his first snow

 buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out 
 now you devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of body at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand 
 and buck was truly a devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights in just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip he whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side he had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground this time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution a dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down 
 after a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush he staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose all the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this with a roar that was almost in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man but the man shifting the club from right to left cooly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest 
 for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless 
 no slouch at what i say one of the men on the wall cried with enthusiasm 
 druther break cayuses any day and twice on sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses 
 senses came back to him but not his strength he lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater 
 answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all will go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog and whale the stuffing outa you understand 
 as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest when the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chuck by chunk from the hand 
 he was beaten he knew that but he was not broken he saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club he had learned the lesson and in all his afterlife he never forgot it that club was a revelation it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect and while he faced that aspect uncowed he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused as the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come and one and all he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated of this last buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery 
 now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater and at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them buck wondered where they went for they never came back but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected 
 yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck could not understand 
 sacredam he cried when his eyes lit upon buck dat one dam bully dog eh how much 
 three hundred and a present at that was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater and seeing government money you got no kick coming eh perrault 
 perrault grinned considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal the canadian government would be no loser nor would its dispatches travel the slower perrault knew dogs when he looked at buck he knew that he was one in a in ten thousand he commented mentally 
 buck saw money pass between them and was not surprised when curly a newfoundland and he were led away by the little weazened man that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater and as curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal it was the last he saw of the warm southland curly and he were taken below by perrault and turned over to a giant called francois perrault was a french canadian and swarthy but francois was a french canadian and twice as swarthy they were a new kind of men to buck of which he was destined to see many more and while he developed no affection for them he none the less grew honestly to respect them he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair men calm and impartial in administering justice and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs 
 in the of the narwhal buck and curly joined two other dogs one of them was a big fellow from spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain and who had later accompanied a geological survey into the barrens 
 he was friendly in a treacherous sort of way smiling into face the while he meditated some underhand trick as for instance when he stole from food at the first meal as buck sprang to punish him the lash of whip sang through the air reaching the culprit first and nothing remained to buck but to recover the bone that was fair of francois he decided and the began his rise in estimation 
 the other dog made no advances nor received any also he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers he was a gloomy morose fellow ant he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone and further that there would be trouble if he were not left alone dave he was called and he ate and slept or yawned between times and took interest in nothing not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed when buck and curly grew excited with fear he raised his head as though annoyed favored them with an incurious glance yawned and went to sleep again 
 day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller and though one day was very like another it was apparent to buck that the weather was steadily growing colder at last one morning the propeller was quiet and the narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement he felt it as did the other dogs and knew that a change was at hand francois leashed them and brought them on deck at the first step upon the cold surface feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud he sprang back with a snort more of this white stuff was falling through the air he shook himself but more of it fell upon him he sniffed it curiously then licked some up on his tongue it bit like fire and the next instant was gone this puzzled him he tried it again with the same results the onlookers laughed uproariously and he felt ashamed he knew not why for it was his first snow

 the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exceptionof the laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions ofthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art thesymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence but no otherdialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old andnot of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a deeperirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweavelife and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy therepublic is the centre around which the other dialogues may begrouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among themoderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge althoughneither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance of truth and both of them had to be content with anabstraction of science which was not yet realized he was the greatestmetaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more thanin any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge arecontained the sciences of logic and psychology which have suppliedso many instruments of thought to are based upon theanalyses of socrates and plato the principles of definition thelaw of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or means and ends between causes and conditions also thedivision of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascibleelements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and and other great forms of thought are all of them to be foundin the republic and were probably first invented by plato thegreatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between wordsand things has been most strenuously insisted on by him althoughhe has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is stillveiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines all truth and all existence is very unlike thedoctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
 neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part ofa still larger design which was to have included an ideal history ofathens as well as a political and physical philosophy the fragmentof the critias has given birth to a fiction secondonly in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur andis said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth century this mythical tale of which the subject was ahistory of the wars of the athenians against the island of supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of thelogographers to the poems of homer it would have told of a strugglefor liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia andhellas we may judge from the noble commencement of the the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book ofthe laws in what manner plato would have treated this highargument we can only guess why the great design was because plato became sensible of some incongruity in afictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it orbecause advancing years forbade the completion of it and we mayplease ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished we should have found plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph overmarathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus wherehe contemplates the growth of the athenian brave athing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceedevery other state of hellas in greatness or more the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to thefavor of apollo and athene 
 again plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz orleader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to befound the original of de republica of st cityof god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous otherimaginary states which are framed upon the same model the extent towhich aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in thepolitics has been little recognized and the recognition is the morenecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the twophilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of andprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected inaristotle in english philosophy too many affinities may be only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in greatoriginal writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his there is a truth higher than experience of which the mindbears witness to herself is a conviction which in our owngeneration has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhapsgaining ground of the greek authors who at the renaissance broughta new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence therepublic of plato is also the first treatise upon education ofwhich the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul andgoethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he hasa revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressedwith the un unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised areal influence on theology and at the revival of literature onpolitics even the fragments of his words when repeated have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who haveseen reflected in them their own higher nature he is the father ofidealism in philosophy in politics in literature and many of thelatest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unityof knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes havebeen anticipated in a dream by him 
 argument 
 the argument of the republic is the search after justice the natureof which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless oldman then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socratesand polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon andadeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates thefirst care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline isdrawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improvedreligion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic amanlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual andthe state we are thus led on to the conception of a higher which no man calls anything his own and in which there isneither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings arephilosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another andhigher education intellectual as well as moral and religious ofscience as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole oflife such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and wouldquickly degenerate to the perfect ideal succeeds the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor this again declining intodemocracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the wheelhas come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetryis discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth andhomer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as animitator is sent into banishment along with them and the idea of thestate is supplemented by the revelation of a future life 
 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 the argument of the republic is the search after justice the natureof which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless oldman then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socratesand polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon andadeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates thefirst care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline isdrawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improvedreligion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic amanlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual andthe state we are thus led on to the conception of a higher which no man calls anything his own and in which there isneither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings arephilosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another andhigher education intellectual as well as moral and religious ofscience as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole oflife such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and wouldquickly degenerate to the perfect ideal succeeds the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor this again declining intodemocracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the wheelhas come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetryis discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth andhomer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as animitator is sent into banishment along with them and the idea of thestate is supplemented by the revelation of a future life 
 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 book i 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice

 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice 
 cephalus socrates polemarchus 
 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 book ii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
 glaucon 
 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 
 socrates glaucon 
 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws

 book ii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice

 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 
 socrates glaucon 
 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws

 book iii 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon
