 while miss linton moped about the park and garden always silent and almost always in tears and her brother shut himself up among books that he never i guessed with a continual vague expectation that catherine repenting her conduct would come of her own accord to ask pardon and seek a she fasted pertinaciously under the idea probably that at every meal edgar was ready to choke for her absence and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet i went about my household duties convinced that the grange had but one sensible soul in its walls and that lodged in my body i wasted no condolences on miss nor any expostulations on my mistress nor did i pay much attention to the sighs of my master who yearned to hear his name since he might not hear her voice i determined they should come about as they pleased for me and though it was a tiresomely slow process i began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress as i thought at first 
 mrs linton on the third day unbarred her door and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter desired a renewed supply and a basin of gruel for she believed she was dying that i set down as a speech meant for ears i believed no such thing so i kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast she ate and drank eagerly and sank back on her pillow again clenching her hands and groaning oh i will die she exclaimed since no one cares anything about me i wish i had not taken that then a good while after i heard her murmur no not be does not love me at would never miss me 
 did you want anything i inquired still preserving my external composure in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange exaggerated manner 
 what is that apathetic being doing she demanded pushing her thick entangled locks from her wasted face has he fallen into a lethargy or is he dead 
 neither replied i if you mean mr linton tolerably well i think though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought he is continually among his books since he has no other society 
 i should not have spoken so if i had known her true condition but i could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder 
 among his books she cried confounded and i dying i on the brink of the grave my god does he know how altered continued she staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall is that catherine linton he imagines me in a play perhaps cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest nelly if it be not too late as soon as i learn how he feels choose between these two either to starve at would be no punishment unless he had a to recover and leave the country are you speaking the truth about him now take care is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life 
 why i answered the master has no idea of your being deranged and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger 
 you think not cannot you tell him i will she returned persuade him speak of your own mind say you are certain i will 
 no you forget mrs linton i suggested that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening and tomorrow you will perceive its good effects 
 if i were only sure it would kill him she interrupted kill myself directly these three awful nights never closed my oh been tormented been haunted nelly but i begin to fancy you like me how strange i thought though everybody hated and despised each other they could not avoid loving me and they have all turned to enemies in a few hours they have positive the people here how dreary to meet death surrounded by their cold faces isabella terrified and repelled afraid to enter the room it would be so dreadful to watch catherine go and edgar standing solemnly by to see it over then offering prayers of thanks to god for restoring peace to his house and going back to his books what in the name of all that feels has he to do with books when i am dying 
 she could not bear the notion which i had put into her head of mr philosophical resignation tossing about she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness and tore the pillow with her teeth then raising herself up all burning desired that i would open the window we were in the middle of winter the wind blew strong from the and i objected both the expressions flitting over her face and the changes of her moods began to alarm me terribly and brought to my recollection her former illness and the injunction that she should not be crossed a minute previously she was violent now supported on one arm and not noticing my refusal to obey her she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species her mind had strayed to other associations 
 a she murmured to herself and this is a wild and this is a they put pigeons feathers in the wonder i die let me take care to throw it on the floor when i lie down and here is a and should know it among a a bonny bird wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor it wanted to get to its nest for the clouds had touched the swells and it felt rain coming this feather was picked up from the heath the bird was not shot we saw its nest in the winter full of little skeletons heathcliff set a trap over it and the old ones dare not come i made him promise never shoot a lapwing after that and he yes here are more did he shoot my lapwings nelly are they red any of them let me look 
 give over with that i interrupted dragging the pillow away and turning the holes towards the mattress for she was removing its contents by handfuls lie down and shut your eyes wandering a mess the down is flying about like snow 
 i went here and there collecting it 
 i see in you nelly she continued dreamily an aged woman you have grey hair and bent shoulders this bed is the fairy cave under peniston crag and you are gathering to hurt our heifers pretending while i am near that they are only locks of wool what come to fifty years hence i know you are not so now not wandering mistaken or else i should believe you really were that withered hag and i should think i was under peniston crag and conscious night and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet 
 the black press where is that i asked you are talking in your sleep 
 against the wall as it always is she replied it does appear see a face in it 
 no press in the room and never was said i resuming my seat and looping up the curtain that i might watch her 
 you see that face she inquired gazing earnestly at the mirror 
 and say what i could i was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own so i rose and covered it with a shawl 
 behind there still she pursued anxiously and it stirred who is it i hope it will not come out when you are gone oh nelly the room is haunted afraid of being alone 
 i took her hand in mine and bid her be composed for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass 
 nobody here i insisted it was yourself mrs linton you knew it a while since 
 myself she gasped and the clock is striking twelve true then dreadful 
 her fingers clutched the clothes and gathered them over her eyes i attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband but i was summoned back by a piercing shawl had dropped from the frame 
 why what is the matter cried i who is coward now wake up that is the mirror mrs linton and you see yourself in it and there am i too by your side 
 trembling and bewildered she held me fast but the horror gradually passed from her countenance its paleness gave place to a glow of shame 
 oh dear i thought i was at home she sighed i thought i was lying in my chamber at wuthering heights because weak my brain got confused and i screamed unconsciously don t say anything but stay with me i dread sleeping my dreams appal me 
 a sound sleep would do you good i answered and i hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again 
 oh if i were but in my own bed in the old house she went on bitterly wringing her hands and that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice do let me feel comes straight down the let me have one breath 
 to pacify her i held the casement ajar a few seconds a cold blast rushed through i closed it and returned to my post she lay still now her face bathed in tears exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit our fiery catherine was no better than a wailing child 
 how long is it since i shut myself in here she asked suddenly reviving 
 it was monday evening i replied and this is thursday night or rather friday morning at present 
 what of the same week she exclaimed only that brief time 
 long enough to live on nothing but cold water and observed i 
 well it seems a weary number of hours she muttered doubtfully it must be more i remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled and edgar being cruelly provoking and me running into this room desperate as soon as ever i had barred the door utter blackness overwhelmed me and i fell on the floor i explain to edgar how certain i felt of having a fit or going raging mad if he persisted in teasing me i had no command of tongue or brain and he did not guess my agony perhaps it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice before i recovered sufficiently to see and hear it began to be dawn and nelly tell you what i thought and what has kept recurring and recurring till i feared for my reason i thought as i lay there with my head against that table leg and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window that i was enclosed in the bed at home and my heart ached with some great grief which just waking i could not recollect i pondered and worried myself to discover what it could be and most strangely the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank i did not recall that they had been at all i was a child my father was just buried and my misery arose from the separation that hindley had ordered between me and heathcliff i was laid alone for the first time and rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping i lifted my hand to push the panels aside it struck the table top i swept it along the carpet and then memory burst in my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair i cannot say why i felt so wildly wretched it must have been temporary derangement for there is scarcely cause but supposing at twelve years old i had been wrenched from the heights and every early association and my all in all as heathcliff was at that time and been converted at a stroke into mrs linton the lady of thrushcross grange and the wife of a stranger an exile and outcast thenceforth from what had been my world you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled shake your head as you will nelly you have helped to unsettle me you should have spoken to edgar indeed you should and compelled him to leave me quiet oh burning i wish i were out of doors i wish i were a girl again half savage and hardy and free and laughing at injuries not maddening under them why am i so changed why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words sure i should be myself were i once among the heather on those hills open the window again wide fasten it open quick why you move 
 because i give you your death of cold i answered 
 you give me a chance of life you mean she said sullenly however not helpless yet open it myself 
 and sliding from the bed before i could hinder her she crossed the room walking very uncertainly threw it back and bent out careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife i entreated and finally attempted to force her to retire but i soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine she was delirious i became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings there was no moon and everything beneath lay in misty darkness not a light gleamed from any house far or had been extinguished long ago and those at wuthering heights were never she asserted she caught their shining 
 look she cried eagerly my room with the candle in it and the trees swaying before it and the other candle is in garret joseph sits up late he waiting till i come home that he may lock the gate well wait a while yet a rough journey and a sad heart to travel it and we must pass by gimmerton kirk to go that journey braved its ghosts often together and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come but heathcliff if i dare you now will you venture if you do keep you not lie there by myself they may bury me twelve feet deep and throw the church down over me but i rest till you are with me i never will 
 she paused and resumed with a strange smile rather come to him find a way then not through that kirkyard you are slow be content you always followed me 
 perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity i was planning how i could reach something to wrap about her without quitting my hold of herself for i could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice when to my consternation i heard the rattle of the door handle and mr linton entered he had only then come from the library and in passing through the lobby had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity or fear to examine what it signified at that late hour 
 oh sir i cried checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber my poor mistress is ill and she quite masters me i cannot manage her at all pray come and persuade her to go to bed forget your anger for hard to guide any way but her own 
 catherine ill he said hastening to us shut the window ellen catherine why 
 he was silent the haggardness of mrs appearance smote him speechless and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment 
 been fretting here i continued and eating scarcely anything and never complaining she would admit none of us till this evening and so we inform you of her state as we were not aware of it ourselves but it is nothing 
 i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly the master frowned it is nothing is it ellen dean he said sternly you shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this and he took his wife in his arms and looked at her with anguish 
 at first she gave him no glance of recognition he was invisible to her abstracted gaze the delirium was not fixed however having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness by degrees she centred her attention on him and discovered who it was that held her 
 ah you are come are you edgar linton she said with angry animation you are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted and when you are wanted never i suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations see we they keep me from my narrow home out yonder my where bound before spring is over there it is not among the lintons mind under the chapel roof but in the open air with a headstone and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me 
 catherine what have you done commenced the master am i nothing to you any more do you love that wretch heath 
 hush cried mrs linton hush this moment you mention that name and i end the matter instantly by a spring from the window what you touch at present you may have but my soul will be on that hill top before you lay hands on me again i want you edgar past wanting you return to your books glad you possess a consolation for all you had in me is gone 
 her mind wanders sir i interposed she has been talking nonsense the whole evening but let her have quiet and proper attendance and rally hereafter we must be cautious how we vex her 
 i desire no further advice from you answered mr linton you know your nature and you encouraged me to harass her and not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days it was heartless months of sickness could not cause such a change 
 i began to defend myself thinking it too bad to be blamed for wicked waywardness i knew mrs nature to be headstrong and domineering cried i but i know that you wished to foster her fierce temper i know that to humour her i should wink at mr heathcliff i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you and i have got a faithful wages well it will teach me to be careful next time next time you may gather intelligence for yourself 
 the next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service ellen dean he replied 
 rather hear nothing about it i suppose then mr linton said i heathcliff has your permission to come a courting to miss and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers on purpose to poison the mistress against you 
 confused as catherine was her wits were alert at applying our conversation 
 ah nelly has played traitor she exclaimed passionately nelly is my hidden enemy you witch so you do seek to hurt us let me go make her rue make her howl a recantation 
 a fury kindled under her brows she struggled desperately to disengage herself from arms i felt no inclination to tarry the event and resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility i quitted the chamber 
 in passing the garden to reach the road at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall i saw something white moved irregularly evidently by another agent than the wind notwithstanding my hurry i stayed to examine it lest ever after i should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world my surprise and perplexity were great to discover by touch more than vision miss springer fanny suspended by a handkerchief and nearly at its last gasp i quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden i had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed and wondered much how it could have got out there and what mischievous person had treated it so while untying the knot round the hook it seemed to me that i repeatedly caught the beat of horses feet galloping at some distance but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that i hardly gave the circumstance a thought though it was a strange sound in that place at two in the morning 
 mr kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as i came up the street and my account of catherine malady induced him to accompany me back immediately he was a plain rough man and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before 
 nelly dean said he i help fancying an extra cause for this what has there been to do at the grange odd reports up here a stout hearty lass like catherine does not fall ill for a trifle and that sort of people should not either hard work bringing them through fevers and such things how did it begin 
 the master will inform you i answered but you are acquainted with the earnshaws violent dispositions and mrs linton caps them all i may say this it commenced in a quarrel she was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit her account at least for she flew off in the height of it and locked herself up afterwards she refused to eat and now she alternately raves and remains in a knowing those about her by having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions 
 mr linton will be sorry observed kenneth interrogatively 
 sorry break his heart should anything happen i replied alarm him more than necessary 
 well i told him to beware said my companion and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning he been thick with mr heathcliff lately 
 heathcliff frequently visits at the grange answered i though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy than because the master likes his company at present discharged from the trouble of calling owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss linton which he manifested i hardly think be taken in again 
 and does miss linton turn a cold shoulder on him was the next question 
 not in her confidence returned i reluctant to continue the subject 
 no a sly one he remarked shaking his head she keeps her own counsel but a real little fool i have it from good authority that last night and a pretty night it was she and heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours and he pressed her not to go in again but just mount his horse and away with him my informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that when it was to be he hear but you urge mr linton to look sharp 
 this news filled me with fresh fears i outstripped kenneth and ran most of the way back the little dog was yelping in the garden yet i spared a minute to open the gate for it but instead of going to the house door it coursed up and down snuffing the grass and would have escaped to the road had i not seized and conveyed it in with me on ascending to room my suspicions were confirmed it was empty had i been a few hours sooner mrs illness might have arrested her rash step but what could be done now there was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly i could not pursue them however and i dare not rouse the family and fill the place with confusion still less unfold the business to my master absorbed as he was in his present calamity and having no heart to spare for a second grief i saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue and suffer matters to take their course and kenneth being arrived i went with a badly composed countenance to announce him catherine lay in a troubled sleep her husband had succeeded in soothing the access of frenzy he now hung over her pillow watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features 
 the doctor on examining the case for himself spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity to me he signified the threatening danger was not so much death as permanent alienation of intellect 
 i did not close my eyes that night nor did mr linton indeed we never went to bed and the servants were all up long before the usual hour moving through the house with stealthy tread and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations everyone was active but miss isabella and they began to remark how sound she slept her brother too asked if she had risen and seemed impatient for her presence and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her i trembled lest he should send me to call her but i was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight one of the maids a thoughtless girl who had been on an early errand to gimmerton came panting upstairs openmouthed and dashed into the chamber crying 
 oh dear dear what mun we have next master master our young lady 
 hold your noise cried i hastily enraged at her clamorous manner 
 speak lower is the matter said mr linton what ails your young lady 
 gone gone yon run off wi her gasped the girl 
 that is not true exclaimed linton rising in agitation it cannot be how has the idea entered your head ellen dean go and seek her it is incredible it cannot be 
 as he spoke he took the servant to the door and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion 
 why i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here she stammered and he asked whether we in trouble at the grange i thought he meant for sickness so i answered yes then says he somebody gone after em i guess i stared he saw i knew nought about it and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a shoe fastened at a shop two miles out of gimmerton not very long after midnight and how the lass had got up to spy who they were she knew them both directly and she noticed the it was she felt certain nobody could mistake him a sovereign in her hand for payment the lady had a cloak about her face but having desired a sup of water while she drank it fell back and she saw her very plain heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on and they set their faces from the village and went as fast as the rough roads would let them the lass said nothing to her father but she told it all over gimmerton this morning 
 i ran and peeped for sake into room confirming when i returned the statement mr linton had resumed his seat by the bed on my he raised his eyes read the meaning of my blank aspect and dropped them without giving an order or uttering a word 
 are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back i inquired how should we do 
 she went of her own accord answered the master she had a right to go if she pleased trouble me no more about her hereafter she is only my sister in name not because i disown her but because she has disowned me 
 and that was all he said on the subject he did not make a single inquiry further or mention her in any way except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home wherever it was when i knew it

 he was silent the haggardness of mrs appearance smote him speechless and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment 
 been fretting here i continued and eating scarcely anything and never complaining she would admit none of us till this evening and so we inform you of her state as we were not aware of it ourselves but it is nothing 
 i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly the master frowned it is nothing is it ellen dean he said sternly you shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this and he took his wife in his arms and looked at her with anguish 
 at first she gave him no glance of recognition he was invisible to her abstracted gaze the delirium was not fixed however having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness by degrees she centred her attention on him and discovered who it was that held her 
 ah you are come are you edgar linton she said with angry animation you are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted and when you are wanted never i suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations see we they keep me from my narrow home out yonder my where bound before spring is over there it is not among the lintons mind under the chapel roof but in the open air with a headstone and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me 
 catherine what have you done commenced the master am i nothing to you any more do you love that wretch heath 
 hush cried mrs linton hush this moment you mention that name and i end the matter instantly by a spring from the window what you touch at present you may have but my soul will be on that hill top before you lay hands on me again i want you edgar past wanting you return to your books glad you possess a consolation for all you had in me is gone 
 her mind wanders sir i interposed she has been talking nonsense the whole evening but let her have quiet and proper attendance and rally hereafter we must be cautious how we vex her 
 i desire no further advice from you answered mr linton you know your nature and you encouraged me to harass her and not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days it was heartless months of sickness could not cause such a change 
 i began to defend myself thinking it too bad to be blamed for wicked waywardness i knew mrs nature to be headstrong and domineering cried i but i know that you wished to foster her fierce temper i know that to humour her i should wink at mr heathcliff i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you and i have got a faithful wages well it will teach me to be careful next time next time you may gather intelligence for yourself 
 the next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service ellen dean he replied 
 rather hear nothing about it i suppose then mr linton said i heathcliff has your permission to come a courting to miss and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers on purpose to poison the mistress against you 
 confused as catherine was her wits were alert at applying our conversation 
 ah nelly has played traitor she exclaimed passionately nelly is my hidden enemy you witch so you do seek to hurt us let me go make her rue make her howl a recantation 
 a fury kindled under her brows she struggled desperately to disengage herself from arms i felt no inclination to tarry the event and resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility i quitted the chamber 
 in passing the garden to reach the road at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall i saw something white moved irregularly evidently by another agent than the wind notwithstanding my hurry i stayed to examine it lest ever after i should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world my surprise and perplexity were great to discover by touch more than vision miss springer fanny suspended by a handkerchief and nearly at its last gasp i quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden i had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed and wondered much how it could have got out there and what mischievous person had treated it so while untying the knot round the hook it seemed to me that i repeatedly caught the beat of horses feet galloping at some distance but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that i hardly gave the circumstance a thought though it was a strange sound in that place at two in the morning 
 mr kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as i came up the street and my account of catherine malady induced him to accompany me back immediately he was a plain rough man and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before 
 nelly dean said he i help fancying an extra cause for this what has there been to do at the grange odd reports up here a stout hearty lass like catherine does not fall ill for a trifle and that sort of people should not either hard work bringing them through fevers and such things how did it begin 
 the master will inform you i answered but you are acquainted with the earnshaws violent dispositions and mrs linton caps them all i may say this it commenced in a quarrel she was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit her account at least for she flew off in the height of it and locked herself up afterwards she refused to eat and now she alternately raves and remains in a knowing those about her by having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions 
 mr linton will be sorry observed kenneth interrogatively 
 sorry break his heart should anything happen i replied alarm him more than necessary 
 well i told him to beware said my companion and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning he been thick with mr heathcliff lately 
 heathcliff frequently visits at the grange answered i though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy than because the master likes his company at present discharged from the trouble of calling owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss linton which he manifested i hardly think be taken in again 
 and does miss linton turn a cold shoulder on him was the next question 
 not in her confidence returned i reluctant to continue the subject 
 no a sly one he remarked shaking his head she keeps her own counsel but a real little fool i have it from good authority that last night and a pretty night it was she and heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours and he pressed her not to go in again but just mount his horse and away with him my informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that when it was to be he hear but you urge mr linton to look sharp 
 this news filled me with fresh fears i outstripped kenneth and ran most of the way back the little dog was yelping in the garden yet i spared a minute to open the gate for it but instead of going to the house door it coursed up and down snuffing the grass and would have escaped to the road had i not seized and conveyed it in with me on ascending to room my suspicions were confirmed it was empty had i been a few hours sooner mrs illness might have arrested her rash step but what could be done now there was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly i could not pursue them however and i dare not rouse the family and fill the place with confusion still less unfold the business to my master absorbed as he was in his present calamity and having no heart to spare for a second grief i saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue and suffer matters to take their course and kenneth being arrived i went with a badly composed countenance to announce him catherine lay in a troubled sleep her husband had succeeded in soothing the access of frenzy he now hung over her pillow watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features 
 the doctor on examining the case for himself spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity to me he signified the threatening danger was not so much death as permanent alienation of intellect 
 i did not close my eyes that night nor did mr linton indeed we never went to bed and the servants were all up long before the usual hour moving through the house with stealthy tread and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations everyone was active but miss isabella and they began to remark how sound she slept her brother too asked if she had risen and seemed impatient for her presence and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her i trembled lest he should send me to call her but i was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight one of the maids a thoughtless girl who had been on an early errand to gimmerton came panting upstairs openmouthed and dashed into the chamber crying 
 oh dear dear what mun we have next master master our young lady 
 hold your noise cried i hastily enraged at her clamorous manner 
 speak lower is the matter said mr linton what ails your young lady 
 gone gone yon run off wi her gasped the girl 
 that is not true exclaimed linton rising in agitation it cannot be how has the idea entered your head ellen dean go and seek her it is incredible it cannot be 
 as he spoke he took the servant to the door and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion 
 why i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here she stammered and he asked whether we in trouble at the grange i thought he meant for sickness so i answered yes then says he somebody gone after em i guess i stared he saw i knew nought about it and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a shoe fastened at a shop two miles out of gimmerton not very long after midnight and how the lass had got up to spy who they were she knew them both directly and she noticed the it was she felt certain nobody could mistake him a sovereign in her hand for payment the lady had a cloak about her face but having desired a sup of water while she drank it fell back and she saw her very plain heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on and they set their faces from the village and went as fast as the rough roads would let them the lass said nothing to her father but she told it all over gimmerton this morning 
 i ran and peeped for sake into room confirming when i returned the statement mr linton had resumed his seat by the bed on my he raised his eyes read the meaning of my blank aspect and dropped them without giving an order or uttering a word 
 are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back i inquired how should we do 
 she went of her own accord answered the master she had a right to go if she pleased trouble me no more about her hereafter she is only my sister in name not because i disown her but because she has disowned me 
 and that was all he said on the subject he did not make a single inquiry further or mention her in any way except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home wherever it was when i knew it

 chapter twelve 
 
 
 beth was postmistress for being most at home she could attend to it regularly and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail one july day she came in with her hands full and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post 
 your posy mother laurie never forgets that she said putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in corner and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy 
 miss meg march one letter and a glove continued beth delivering the articles to her sister who sat near her mother stitching wristbands 
 why i left a pair over there and here is only one said meg looking at the gray cotton glove you drop the other in the garden 
 no sure i for there was only one in the office 
 i hate to have odd gloves never mind the other may be found my letter is only a translation of the german song i wanted i think mr brooke did it for this writing 
 mrs march glanced at meg who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown with the little curls blowing about her forehead and very womanly as she sat sewing at her little worktable full of tidy white rolls so unconscious of the thought in her mind as she sewed and sang while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt that mrs march smiled and was satisfied 
 two letters for doctor jo a book and a funny old hat which covered the whole post office and stuck outside said beth laughing as she went into the study where jo sat writing 
 what a sly fellow laurie is i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion because i burn my face every hot day he said why mind the fashion wear a big hat and be comfortable i said i would if i had one and he has sent me this to try me wear it for fun and show him i care for the fashion and hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of plato jo read her letters 
 one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her 
 
 my dear 
 i write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction i watch your efforts to control your temper you say nothing about your trials failures or successes and think perhaps that no one sees them but the friend whose help you daily ask if i may trust the cover of your guidebook i too have seen them all and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution since it begins to bear fruit go on dear patiently and bravely and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving 
 mother 
 
 that does me good worth millions of money and pecks of praise oh marmee i do try i will keep on trying and not get tired since i have you to help me 
 laying her head on her arms jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good and this assurance was doubly precious doubly encouraging because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her apollyon she pinned the note inside her frock as a shield and a reminder lest she be taken unaware and proceeded to open her other letter quite ready for either good or bad news in a big dashing hand laurie wrote 
 
 
 dear jo 
 what ho 
 some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and i want to have a jolly time if fine going to pitch my tent in longmeadow and row up the whole crew to lunch and a fire make messes gypsy fashion and all sorts of larks they are nice people and like such things brooke will go to keep us boys steady and kate vaughn will play propriety for the girls i want you all to come let beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her bother about rations see to that and everything else only do come a good fellow 
 in a tearing hurry 
 yours ever laurie 
 
 richness cried jo flying in to tell the news to meg 
 of course we can go mother it will be such a help to laurie for i can row and meg see to the lunch and the children be useful in some way 
 i hope the vaughns are not fine people do you know anything about them jo asked meg 
 only that there are four of them kate is older than you fred and frank twins about my age and a little girl grace who is nine or ten laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys i fancied from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her that he admire kate much 
 so glad my french print is clean just the thing and so becoming observed meg complacently have you anything decent jo 
 scarlet and gray boating suit good enough for me i shall row and tramp about so i want any starch to think of come betty 
 if you let any boys talk to me 
 not a boy 
 i like to please laurie and not afraid of mr brooke he is so kind but i want to play or sing or say anything work hard and not trouble anyone and take care of me jo so go 
 my good girl you do try to fight off your shyness and i love you for it fighting faults easy as i know and a cheery word kind of gives a lift thank you mother and jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss more precious to mrs march than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth 
 i had a box of chocolate drops and the picture i wanted to copy said amy showing her mail 
 and i got a note from mr laurence asking me to come over and play to him tonight before the lamps are lighted and i shall go added beth whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely now fly round and do double duty today so that we can play tomorrow with free minds said jo preparing to replace her pen with a broom 
 when the sun peeped into the girls room early next morning to promise them a fine day he saw a comical sight each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream beth had taken joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation and amy had capped the climax by putting a colthespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature it was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put this funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun for he burst out with such radiance that jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at ornament 
 sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party and soon a lively bustle began in both houses beth who was ready first kept reporting what went on next door and enlivened her sisters toilets by frequent telegrams from the window there goes the man with the tent i see mrs barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket now mr laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock i wish he would go too laurie looking like a sailor nice boy oh mercy me a carriage full of people a tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys one is lame poor thing got a crutch laurie tell us that be quick girls getting late why there is ned moffat i do declare meg that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping 
 so it is how queer that he should come i thought he was at the mountains there is sallie glad she got back in time am i all right jo cried meg in a flutter 
 a regular daisy hold up your dress and put your hat on straight it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff now then come on 
 oh jo you are not going to wear that awful hat too absurd you shall not make a guy of yourself remonstrated meg as jo tied down with a red ribbon the leghorn laurie had sent for a joke 
 i just will though for capital so shady light and big it will make fun and i mind being a guy if that jo marched straight away and the rest followed a bright little band of sisters all looking their best in summer suits with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims 
 laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner the lawn was the reception room and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there meg was grateful to see that miss kate though twenty was dressed with a simplicity which american girls would do well to imitate and who was much flattered by mr assurances that he came especially to see her jo understood why laurie primmed up his mouth when speaking of kate for that young lady had a air which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not dreadful but gentle and feeble and she would be kind to him on that account amy found grace a merry little person and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes they suddenly became very good friends 
 tents lunch and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand the party was soon embarked and the two boats pushed off together leaving mr laurence waving his hat on the shore laurie and jo rowed one boat mr brooke and ned the other while fred vaughn the riotous twin did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug funny hat deserved a vote of thanks for it was of general utility it broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh it created quite a refreshing breeze flapping to and fro as she rowed and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party if a shower came up she said miss kate decided that she was odd but rather clever and smiled upon her from afar 
 meg in the other boat was delightfully situated face to face with the rowers who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity mr brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge he never talked to her much but he looked at her a good deal and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion ned being in college of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume he was not very wise but very and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic sallie gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous fred who kept beth in constant terror by his pranks 
 it was not far to longmeadow but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived a pleasant green field with three oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet 
 welcome to camp laurence said the young host as they landed with exclamations of delight 
 brooke is commander in chief i am commissary general the other fellows are staff officers and you ladies are company the tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen now have a game before it gets hot and then see about dinner 
 frank beth amy and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight mr brooke chose meg kate and fred laurie took sallie jo and ned the english played well but the americans played better and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of inspired them jo and fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke which failure ruffled her a good deal fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers he gave a stroke his ball hit the wicket and stopped an inch on the wrong side no one was very near and running up to examine he gave it a sly nudge with his toe which put it just an inch on the right side 
 through now miss jo settle you and get in first cried the young gentleman swinging his mallet for another blow 
 you pushed it i saw you my turn now said jo sharply 
 upon my word i move it it rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed so stand off please and let me have a go at the stake 
 we cheat in america but you can if you choose said jo angrily 
 yankees are a deal the most tricky everybody knows there you go returned fred croqueting her ball far away 
 jo opened her lips to say something rude but checked herself in time colored up to her forehead and stood a minute hammering down a wicket with all her might while fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation she went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she cameback looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently it took several strokes to regain the place she had lost and when she got there the other side had nearly won for ball was the last but one and lay near the stake 
 by george all up with us goodbye kate miss jo owes me one so you are finished cried fred excitedly as they all drew near to see the finish 
 yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies said jo with a look that made the lad redden especially when they beat them she added as leaving ball untouched she won the game by a clever stroke 
 laurie threw up his hat then remembered that it do to exult over the defeat of his guests and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend good for you jo he did cheat i saw him we tell him so but he do it again take my word for it 
 meg drew her aside under pretense of pinning up a loose braid and said approvingly it was dreadfully provoking but you kept your temper and so glad jo 
 praise me meg for i could box his ears this minute i should certainly have boiled over if i stayed among the nettles till i got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue simmering now so i hope keep out of my way returned jo biting her lips as she glowered at fred from under her big hat 
 time for lunch said mr brooke looking at his watch commissary general will you make the fire and get water while miss march miss sallie and i spread the table who can make good coffee 
 jo can said meg glad to recommend her sister so jo feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor went to preside over the coffeepot while the children collected dry sticks and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by miss kate sketched and frank talked to beth who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates 
 the commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables prettily decorated with green leaves jo announced that the coffee was ready and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal for youth is seldom dyspeptic and exercise develops wholesome appetites a very merry lunch it was for everything seemed fresh and funny and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by there was a pleasing inequality in the table which produced many mishaps to cups and plates acorns dropped in the milk little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on three children peeped over the fence and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main 
 salt here said laurie as he handed jo a saucer of berries 
 thank you i prefer spiders she replied fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death how dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party when is so nice in every way added jo as they both laughed and ate out of one plate the china having run short 
 i had an uncommonly good time that day and got over it yet this is no credit to me you know i do anything you and meg and brooke who make it all go and no end obliged to you what shall we do when we eat anymore asked laurie feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over 
 have games till cooler i brought authors and i dare say miss kate knows something new and nice go and ask her company and you ought to stay with her more 
 you company too i thought suit brooke but he keeps talking to meg and kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers going so you try to preach propriety for you do it jo 
 miss kate did know several new games and as the girls would not and the boys could not eat any more they all adjourned to the drawing room to play 
 one person begins a story any nonsense you like and tells as long as he pleases only taking care to stop short at some exciting point when the next takes it up and does the same very funny when well done and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over please start it mr brooke said kate with a commanding air which surprised meg who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman 
 lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies mr brooke obediently began the story with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river 
 once on a time a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune for he had nothing but his sword and his shield he traveled a long while nearly years and had a hard time of it till he came to the palace of a good old king who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt of which he was very fond the knight agreed to try and got on slowly but surely for the colt was a gallant fellow and soon learned to love his new master though he was freakish and wild every day when he gave his lessons to this pet of the the knight rode him through the city and as he rode he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face which he had seen many times in his dreams but never found one day as he went prancing down a quiet street he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face he was delighted inquired who lived in this old castle and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty the knight wished intensely that he could free them but he was poor and could only go by each day watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them he went and knocked the great door flew open and he beheld 
 a ravishingly lovely lady who exclaimed with a cry of rapture at last at last continued kate who had read french novels and admired the style tis she cried count gustave and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy oh rise she said extending a hand of marble fairness never till you tell me how i may rescue you swore the knight still kneeling alas my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed where is the villain in the mauve salon go brave heart and save me from despair i obey and return victorious or dead with these thrilling words he rushed away and flinging open the door of the mauve salon was about to enter when he received 
 a stunning blow from the big greek lexicon which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him said ned instantly sir recovered himself pitched the tyrant out of the window and turned to join the lady victorious but with a bump on his brow found the door locked tore up the curtains made a rope ladder got halfway down when the ladder broke and he went headfirst into the moat sixty feet below could swim like a duck paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts then by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength he smashed in the door went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick toads as big as your fist and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics miss march at the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood 
 a tall figure all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand went on meg it beckoned gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side a dead silence reigned the lamp burned blue and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil they reached a curtained door behind which sounded lovely music he sprang forward to enter but the specter plucked him back and waved threateningly before him a 
 snuffbox said jo in a sepulchral tone which convulsed the audience thankee said the knight politely as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off ha ha laughed the ghost and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads like sardines who all rose and began to 
 dance a hornpipe cut in fred as jo paused for breath and as they danced the rubbishy old castle turned to a in full sail up with the jib reef the halliards helm hard alee and man the guns roared the captain as a portuguese pirate hove in sight with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast go in and win my hearties says the captain and a tremendous fight began of course the british beat they always do 
 no they cried jo aside 
 having taken the pirate captain prisoner sailed slap over the schooner whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood for the order had been cutlasses and die hard mate take a bight of the sheet and start this villain if he confess his sins double quick said the british captain the portuguese held his tongue like a brick and walked the plank while the jolly tars cheered like mad but the sly dog dived came up under the scuttled her and down she went with all sail set to the bottom of the sea sea sea where 
 oh gracious what shall i say cried sallie as fred ended his rigmarole in which he had jumbled together nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books well they went to the bottom and a nice mermaid welcomed them but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights and kindly pickled them in brine hoping to discover the mystery about them for being a woman she was curious a diver came down and the mermaid said give you a box of pearls if you can take it up for she wanted to restore the poor things to life and raise the heavy load herself so the diver hoisted it up and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls he left it in a great lonely field where it was found by a 
 little goose girl who kept a hundred fat geese in the field said amy when invention gave out the little girl was sorry for them and asked an old woman what she should do to help them your geese will tell you they know everything said the old woman so she asked what she should use for new heads since the old ones were lost and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed 
 cabbages continued laurie promptly just the thing said the girl and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden she put them on the knights revived at once thanked her and went on their way rejoicing never knowing the difference for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it the knight in whom interest went back to find the pretty face and learned that the princesses had spunthemselves free and all gone and married but one he was in a great state of mind at that and mounting the colt who stood by him through thick and thin rushed to the castle to see which was left peeping over the hedge he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden will you give me a rose said he you must come and get it i come to you it proper said she as sweet as honey he tried to climb over the hedge but it seemed to grow higher and higher then he tried to push through but it grew thicker and thicker and he was in despair so he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped saying imploringly let me in let me in but the pretty princess did not seem to understand for she picked her roses quietly and left him to fight his way in whether he did or not frank will tell you 
 i not playing i never do said frank dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple beth had disappeared behind jo and grace was asleep 
 so the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge is he asked mr brooke still watching the river and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole 
 i guess the princess gave him a posy and opened the gate after a while said laurie smiling to himself as he threw acorns at his tutor 
 what a piece of nonsense we have made with practice we might do something quite clever do you know truth 
 i hope so said meg soberly 
 the game i mean 
 what is it said fred 
 why you pile up your hands choose a number and draw out in turn and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest great fun 
 try it said jo who liked new experiments 
 miss kate and mr booke meg and ned declined but fred sallie jo and laurie piled and drew and the lot fell to laurie 
 who are your heroes asked jo 
 grandfather and napoleon 
 which lady here do you think prettiest said sallie 
 margaret 
 which do you like best from fred 
 jo of course 
 what silly questions you ask and jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at tone 
 try again truth a bad game said fred 
 a very good one for you retorted jo in a low voice her turn came next 
 what is your greatest fault asked fred by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself 
 a quick temper 
 what do you most wish for said laurie 
 a pair of boot lacings returned jo guessing and defeating his purpose 
 not a true answer you must say what you really do want most 
 genius you wish you could give it to me laurie 
 and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face 
 what virtues do you most admire in a man asked sallie 
 courage and honesty 
 now my turn said fred as his hand came last 
 give it to him whispered laurie to jo who nodded and asked at once 
 you cheat at croquet 
 well yes a little bit 
 good you take your story out of the sea lion said laurie 
 rather 
 you think the english nation perfect in every respect asked sallie 
 i should be ashamed of myself if i 
 a true john bull now miss sallie you shall have a chance without waiting to draw harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you think you are something of a flirt said laurie as jo nodded to fred as a sign that peace was declared 
 you impertinent boy of course not exclaimed sallie with an air that proved the contrary 
 what do you hate most asked fred 
 spiders and rice pudding 
 what do you like best asked jo 
 dancing and french gloves 
 well i think truth is a very silly play have a sensible game of authors to refresh our minds proposed jo 
 ned frank and the little girls joined in this and while it went on the three elders sat apart talking miss kate took out her sketch again and margaret watched her while mr brooke lay on the grass with a book which he did not read 
 how beautifully you do it i wish i could draw said meg with mingled admiration and regret in her voice 
 why you learn i should think you had taste and talent for it replied miss kate graciously 
 i time 
 your mamma prefers other accomplishments i fancy so did mine but i proved to her that i had talent by taking a few lessons privately and then she was quite willing i should go on you do the same with your governess 
 i have none 
 i forgot young ladies in america go to school more than with us very fine schools they are too papa says you go to a private one i suppose 
 i go at all i am a governess myself 
 oh indeed said miss kate but she might as well have said dear me how dreadful for her tone implied it and something in her face made meg color and wish she had not been so frank 
 mr brooke looked up and said quickly young ladies in america love independence as much as their ancestors did and are admired and respected for supporting themselves 
 oh yes of course very nice and proper in them to do so we have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility because being the daughters of gentlemen they are both well bred and accomplished you know said miss kate in a patronizing tone that hurt pride and made her work seem not only more distasteful but degrading 
 did the german song suit miss march inquired mr brooke breaking an awkward pause 
 oh yes it was very sweet and much obliged to whoever translated it for me and downcast face brightened as she spoke 
 you read german asked miss kate with a look of surprise 
 not very well my father who taught me is away and i get on very fast alone for no one to correct my pronunciation 
 try a little now here is mary stuart and a tutor who loves to teach and mr brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile 
 so hard afraid to try said meg grateful but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her 
 read a bit to encourage you and miss kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner 
 mr brooke made no comment as she returned the book to meg who said innocently i thought it was poetry some of it is try this passage 
 there was a queer smile about mr mouth as he opened at poor lament 
 meg obediently following the long which her new tutor used to point with read slowly and timidly unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice down the page went the green guide and presently forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene meg read as if alone giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen if she had seen the brown eyes then she would have stopped short but she never looked up and the lesson was not spoiled for her 
 very well indeed said mr brooke as she paused quite ignoring her many mistakes and looking as if he did indeed love to teach 
 miss kate put up her glass and having taken a survey of the little tableau before her shut her sketch book saying with condescension a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader i advise you to learn for german is a valuable accomplishment to teachers i must look after grace she is romping and miss kate strolled away adding to herself with a shrug i come to chaperone a governess though she is young and pretty what odd people these yankees are afraid laurie will be quite spoiled among them 
 i forgot that english people rather turn up their noses at governesses and treat them as we do said meg looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression 
 tutors also have rather a hard time of it there as i know to my sorrow no place like america for us workers miss margaret and mr brooke looked so contented and cheerful that meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot 
 glad i live in it then i like my work but i get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all so i complain i only wished i liked teaching as you do 
 i think you would if you had laurie for a pupil i shall be very sorry to lose him next year said mr brooke busily punching holes in the turf 
 going to college i suppose lips asked the question but her eyes added and what becomes of you 
 yes high time he went for he is ready and as soon as he is off i shall turn soldier i am needed 
 i am glad of that exclaimed meg i should think every young man would want to go though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home she added sorrowfully 
 i have neither and very few friends to care whether i live or die said mr brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up like a little grave 
 laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you said meg heartily 
 thank you that sounds pleasant began mr brooke looking cheerful again but before he could finish his speech ned mounted on the old horse came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies and there was no more quiet that day 
 you love to ride asked grace of amy as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others led by ned 
 
 i dote upon it my sister meg used to ride when papa was rich but we keep any horses now except ellen tree added amy laughing 
 tell me about ellen tree is it a donkey asked grace curiously 
 why you see jo is crazy about horses and so am i but only got an old sidesaddle and no horse out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch so jo put the saddle on it fixed some reins on the part that turns up and we bounce away on ellen tree whenever we like 
 how funny laughed grace i have a pony at home and ride nearly every day in the park with fred and kate very nice for my friends go too and the row is full of ladies and gentlemen 
 dear how charming i hope i shall go abroad some day but rather go to rome than the row said amy who had not the remotest idea what the row was and have asked for the world 
 frank sitting just behind the little girls heard what they were saying and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics beth who was collecting the scattered author cards looked up and said in her shy yet friendly way afraid you are tired can i do anything for you 
 talk to me please dull sitting by myself answered frank who had evidently been used to being made much of at home 
 if he asked her to deliver a latin oration it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful beth but there was no place to run to no jo to hide behind now and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try 
 what do you like to talk about she asked fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up 
 well i like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting said frank who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength 
 my heart what shall i do i know anything about them thought beth and forgetting the misfortune in her flurry she said hoping to make him talk i never saw any hunting but i suppose you know all about it 
 i did once but i can never hunt again for i got hurt leaping a confounded gate so there are no more horses and hounds for me said frank with a sigh that made beth hate herself for her innocent blunder 
 your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes she said turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys books in which jo delighted 
 buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory and in her eagerness to amuse another beth forgot herself and was quite unconscious of her sisters surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys against whom she had begged protection 
 bless her heart she pities him so she is good to him aid jo beaming at her from the croquet ground 
 i always said she was a little saint added meg as if there could be no further doubt of it 
 i heard frank laugh so much for ever so long said grace to amy as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups 
 my sister beth is a very fastidious girl when she likes to be said amy well pleased at success she meant facinating but as grace know the exact meaning of either word fastidious sounded well and made a good impression 
 an impromptu circus fox and geese and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon at sunset the tent was struck hampers packed wickets pulled up boats loaded and the whole party floated down the river singing at the tops of their voices ned getting sentimental warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain 
 alone alone ah woe alone 
 and at the lines 
 we each are young we each have a heart oh why should we stand thus coldly apart 
 he looked at meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song 
 how can you be so cruel to me he whispered under cover of a lively chorus kept close to that englishwoman all day and now you snub me 
 i mean to but you looked so funny i really help it replied meg passing over the first part of his reproach for it was quite true that she had shunned him remembering the moffat party and the talk after it 
 ned was offended and turned to sallie for consolation saying to her rather pettishly there a bit of flirt in that girl is there 
 not a particle but a dear returned sallie defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings 
 not a stricken deer anyway said ned trying to be witty and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do 
 on the lawn where it had gathered the little party separated with cordial good nights and for the vaughns were going to canada as the four sisters went home through the garden miss kate looked after them saying without the patronizing tone in her voice in spite of their demonstrative manners american girls are very nice when one knows them 
 i quite agree with you said mr brooke

 chapter twelve 
 
 
 beth was postmistress for being most at home she could attend to it regularly and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail one july day she came in with her hands full and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post 
 your posy mother laurie never forgets that she said putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in corner and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy 
 miss meg march one letter and a glove continued beth delivering the articles to her sister who sat near her mother stitching wristbands 
 why i left a pair over there and here is only one said meg looking at the gray cotton glove you drop the other in the garden 
 no sure i for there was only one in the office 
 i hate to have odd gloves never mind the other may be found my letter is only a translation of the german song i wanted i think mr brooke did it for this writing 
 mrs march glanced at meg who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown with the little curls blowing about her forehead and very womanly as she sat sewing at her little worktable full of tidy white rolls so unconscious of the thought in her mind as she sewed and sang while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt that mrs march smiled and was satisfied 
 two letters for doctor jo a book and a funny old hat which covered the whole post office and stuck outside said beth laughing as she went into the study where jo sat writing 
 what a sly fellow laurie is i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion because i burn my face every hot day he said why mind the fashion wear a big hat and be comfortable i said i would if i had one and he has sent me this to try me wear it for fun and show him i care for the fashion and hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of plato jo read her letters 
 one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her 
 
 my dear 
 i write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction i watch your efforts to control your temper you say nothing about your trials failures or successes and think perhaps that no one sees them but the friend whose help you daily ask if i may trust the cover of your guidebook i too have seen them all and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution since it begins to bear fruit go on dear patiently and bravely and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving 
 mother 
 
 that does me good worth millions of money and pecks of praise oh marmee i do try i will keep on trying and not get tired since i have you to help me 
 laying her head on her arms jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good and this assurance was doubly precious doubly encouraging because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her apollyon she pinned the note inside her frock as a shield and a reminder lest she be taken unaware and proceeded to open her other letter quite ready for either good or bad news in a big dashing hand laurie wrote 
 
 
 dear jo 
 what ho 
 some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and i want to have a jolly time if fine going to pitch my tent in longmeadow and row up the whole crew to lunch and a fire make messes gypsy fashion and all sorts of larks they are nice people and like such things brooke will go to keep us boys steady and kate vaughn will play propriety for the girls i want you all to come let beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her bother about rations see to that and everything else only do come a good fellow 
 in a tearing hurry 
 yours ever laurie 
 
 richness cried jo flying in to tell the news to meg 
 of course we can go mother it will be such a help to laurie for i can row and meg see to the lunch and the children be useful in some way 
 i hope the vaughns are not fine people do you know anything about them jo asked meg 
 only that there are four of them kate is older than you fred and frank twins about my age and a little girl grace who is nine or ten laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys i fancied from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her that he admire kate much 
 so glad my french print is clean just the thing and so becoming observed meg complacently have you anything decent jo 
 scarlet and gray boating suit good enough for me i shall row and tramp about so i want any starch to think of come betty 
 if you let any boys talk to me 
 not a boy 
 i like to please laurie and not afraid of mr brooke he is so kind but i want to play or sing or say anything work hard and not trouble anyone and take care of me jo so go 
 my good girl you do try to fight off your shyness and i love you for it fighting faults easy as i know and a cheery word kind of gives a lift thank you mother and jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss more precious to mrs march than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth 
 i had a box of chocolate drops and the picture i wanted to copy said amy showing her mail 
 and i got a note from mr laurence asking me to come over and play to him tonight before the lamps are lighted and i shall go added beth whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely now fly round and do double duty today so that we can play tomorrow with free minds said jo preparing to replace her pen with a broom 
 when the sun peeped into the girls room early next morning to promise them a fine day he saw a comical sight each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream beth had taken joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation and amy had capped the climax by putting a colthespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature it was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put this funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun for he burst out with such radiance that jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at ornament 
 sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party and soon a lively bustle began in both houses beth who was ready first kept reporting what went on next door and enlivened her sisters toilets by frequent telegrams from the window there goes the man with the tent i see mrs barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket now mr laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock i wish he would go too laurie looking like a sailor nice boy oh mercy me a carriage full of people a tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys one is lame poor thing got a crutch laurie tell us that be quick girls getting late why there is ned moffat i do declare meg that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping 
 so it is how queer that he should come i thought he was at the mountains there is sallie glad she got back in time am i all right jo cried meg in a flutter 
 a regular daisy hold up your dress and put your hat on straight it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff now then come on 
 oh jo you are not going to wear that awful hat too absurd you shall not make a guy of yourself remonstrated meg as jo tied down with a red ribbon the leghorn laurie had sent for a joke 
 i just will though for capital so shady light and big it will make fun and i mind being a guy if that jo marched straight away and the rest followed a bright little band of sisters all looking their best in summer suits with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims 
 laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner the lawn was the reception room and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there meg was grateful to see that miss kate though twenty was dressed with a simplicity which american girls would do well to imitate and who was much flattered by mr assurances that he came especially to see her jo understood why laurie primmed up his mouth when speaking of kate for that young lady had a air which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not dreadful but gentle and feeble and she would be kind to him on that account amy found grace a merry little person and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes they suddenly became very good friends 
 tents lunch and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand the party was soon embarked and the two boats pushed off together leaving mr laurence waving his hat on the shore laurie and jo rowed one boat mr brooke and ned the other while fred vaughn the riotous twin did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug funny hat deserved a vote of thanks for it was of general utility it broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh it created quite a refreshing breeze flapping to and fro as she rowed and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party if a shower came up she said miss kate decided that she was odd but rather clever and smiled upon her from afar 
 meg in the other boat was delightfully situated face to face with the rowers who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity mr brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge he never talked to her much but he looked at her a good deal and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion ned being in college of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume he was not very wise but very and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic sallie gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous fred who kept beth in constant terror by his pranks 
 it was not far to longmeadow but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived a pleasant green field with three oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet 
 welcome to camp laurence said the young host as they landed with exclamations of delight 
 brooke is commander in chief i am commissary general the other fellows are staff officers and you ladies are company the tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen now have a game before it gets hot and then see about dinner 
 frank beth amy and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight mr brooke chose meg kate and fred laurie took sallie jo and ned the english played well but the americans played better and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of inspired them jo and fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke which failure ruffled her a good deal fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers he gave a stroke his ball hit the wicket and stopped an inch on the wrong side no one was very near and running up to examine he gave it a sly nudge with his toe which put it just an inch on the right side 
 through now miss jo settle you and get in first cried the young gentleman swinging his mallet for another blow 
 you pushed it i saw you my turn now said jo sharply 
 upon my word i move it it rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed so stand off please and let me have a go at the stake 
 we cheat in america but you can if you choose said jo angrily 
 yankees are a deal the most tricky everybody knows there you go returned fred croqueting her ball far away 
 jo opened her lips to say something rude but checked herself in time colored up to her forehead and stood a minute hammering down a wicket with all her might while fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation she went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she cameback looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently it took several strokes to regain the place she had lost and when she got there the other side had nearly won for ball was the last but one and lay near the stake 
 by george all up with us goodbye kate miss jo owes me one so you are finished cried fred excitedly as they all drew near to see the finish 
 yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies said jo with a look that made the lad redden especially when they beat them she added as leaving ball untouched she won the game by a clever stroke 
 laurie threw up his hat then remembered that it do to exult over the defeat of his guests and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend good for you jo he did cheat i saw him we tell him so but he do it again take my word for it 
 meg drew her aside under pretense of pinning up a loose braid and said approvingly it was dreadfully provoking but you kept your temper and so glad jo 
 praise me meg for i could box his ears this minute i should certainly have boiled over if i stayed among the nettles till i got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue simmering now so i hope keep out of my way returned jo biting her lips as she glowered at fred from under her big hat 
 time for lunch said mr brooke looking at his watch commissary general will you make the fire and get water while miss march miss sallie and i spread the table who can make good coffee 
 jo can said meg glad to recommend her sister so jo feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor went to preside over the coffeepot while the children collected dry sticks and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by miss kate sketched and frank talked to beth who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates 
 the commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables prettily decorated with green leaves jo announced that the coffee was ready and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal for youth is seldom dyspeptic and exercise develops wholesome appetites a very merry lunch it was for everything seemed fresh and funny and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by there was a pleasing inequality in the table which produced many mishaps to cups and plates acorns dropped in the milk little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on three children peeped over the fence and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main 
 salt here said laurie as he handed jo a saucer of berries 
 thank you i prefer spiders she replied fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death how dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party when is so nice in every way added jo as they both laughed and ate out of one plate the china having run short 
 i had an uncommonly good time that day and got over it yet this is no credit to me you know i do anything you and meg and brooke who make it all go and no end obliged to you what shall we do when we eat anymore asked laurie feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over 
 have games till cooler i brought authors and i dare say miss kate knows something new and nice go and ask her company and you ought to stay with her more 
 you company too i thought suit brooke but he keeps talking to meg and kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers going so you try to preach propriety for you do it jo 
 miss kate did know several new games and as the girls would not and the boys could not eat any more they all adjourned to the drawing room to play 
 one person begins a story any nonsense you like and tells as long as he pleases only taking care to stop short at some exciting point when the next takes it up and does the same very funny when well done and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over please start it mr brooke said kate with a commanding air which surprised meg who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman 
 lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies mr brooke obediently began the story with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river 
 once on a time a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune for he had nothing but his sword and his shield he traveled a long while nearly years and had a hard time of it till he came to the palace of a good old king who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt of which he was very fond the knight agreed to try and got on slowly but surely for the colt was a gallant fellow and soon learned to love his new master though he was freakish and wild every day when he gave his lessons to this pet of the the knight rode him through the city and as he rode he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face which he had seen many times in his dreams but never found one day as he went prancing down a quiet street he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face he was delighted inquired who lived in this old castle and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty the knight wished intensely that he could free them but he was poor and could only go by each day watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them he went and knocked the great door flew open and he beheld 
 a ravishingly lovely lady who exclaimed with a cry of rapture at last at last continued kate who had read french novels and admired the style tis she cried count gustave and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy oh rise she said extending a hand of marble fairness never till you tell me how i may rescue you swore the knight still kneeling alas my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed where is the villain in the mauve salon go brave heart and save me from despair i obey and return victorious or dead with these thrilling words he rushed away and flinging open the door of the mauve salon was about to enter when he received 
 a stunning blow from the big greek lexicon which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him said ned instantly sir recovered himself pitched the tyrant out of the window and turned to join the lady victorious but with a bump on his brow found the door locked tore up the curtains made a rope ladder got halfway down when the ladder broke and he went headfirst into the moat sixty feet below could swim like a duck paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts then by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength he smashed in the door went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick toads as big as your fist and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics miss march at the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood 
 a tall figure all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand went on meg it beckoned gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side a dead silence reigned the lamp burned blue and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil they reached a curtained door behind which sounded lovely music he sprang forward to enter but the specter plucked him back and waved threateningly before him a 
 snuffbox said jo in a sepulchral tone which convulsed the audience thankee said the knight politely as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off ha ha laughed the ghost and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads like sardines who all rose and began to 
 dance a hornpipe cut in fred as jo paused for breath and as they danced the rubbishy old castle turned to a in full sail up with the jib reef the halliards helm hard alee and man the guns roared the captain as a portuguese pirate hove in sight with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast go in and win my hearties says the captain and a tremendous fight began of course the british beat they always do 
 no they cried jo aside 
 having taken the pirate captain prisoner sailed slap over the schooner whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood for the order had been cutlasses and die hard mate take a bight of the sheet and start this villain if he confess his sins double quick said the british captain the portuguese held his tongue like a brick and walked the plank while the jolly tars cheered like mad but the sly dog dived came up under the scuttled her and down she went with all sail set to the bottom of the sea sea sea where 
 oh gracious what shall i say cried sallie as fred ended his rigmarole in which he had jumbled together nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books well they went to the bottom and a nice mermaid welcomed them but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights and kindly pickled them in brine hoping to discover the mystery about them for being a woman she was curious a diver came down and the mermaid said give you a box of pearls if you can take it up for she wanted to restore the poor things to life and raise the heavy load herself so the diver hoisted it up and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls he left it in a great lonely field where it was found by a 
 little goose girl who kept a hundred fat geese in the field said amy when invention gave out the little girl was sorry for them and asked an old woman what she should do to help them your geese will tell you they know everything said the old woman so she asked what she should use for new heads since the old ones were lost and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed 
 cabbages continued laurie promptly just the thing said the girl and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden she put them on the knights revived at once thanked her and went on their way rejoicing never knowing the difference for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it the knight in whom interest went back to find the pretty face and learned that the princesses had spunthemselves free and all gone and married but one he was in a great state of mind at that and mounting the colt who stood by him through thick and thin rushed to the castle to see which was left peeping over the hedge he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden will you give me a rose said he you must come and get it i come to you it proper said she as sweet as honey he tried to climb over the hedge but it seemed to grow higher and higher then he tried to push through but it grew thicker and thicker and he was in despair so he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped saying imploringly let me in let me in but the pretty princess did not seem to understand for she picked her roses quietly and left him to fight his way in whether he did or not frank will tell you 
 i not playing i never do said frank dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple beth had disappeared behind jo and grace was asleep 
 so the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge is he asked mr brooke still watching the river and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole 
 i guess the princess gave him a posy and opened the gate after a while said laurie smiling to himself as he threw acorns at his tutor 
 what a piece of nonsense we have made with practice we might do something quite clever do you know truth 
 i hope so said meg soberly 
 the game i mean 
 what is it said fred 
 why you pile up your hands choose a number and draw out in turn and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest great fun 
 try it said jo who liked new experiments 
 miss kate and mr booke meg and ned declined but fred sallie jo and laurie piled and drew and the lot fell to laurie 
 who are your heroes asked jo 
 grandfather and napoleon 
 which lady here do you think prettiest said sallie 
 margaret 
 which do you like best from fred 
 jo of course 
 what silly questions you ask and jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at tone 
 try again truth a bad game said fred 
 a very good one for you retorted jo in a low voice her turn came next 
 what is your greatest fault asked fred by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself 
 a quick temper 
 what do you most wish for said laurie 
 a pair of boot lacings returned jo guessing and defeating his purpose 
 not a true answer you must say what you really do want most 
 genius you wish you could give it to me laurie 
 and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face 
 what virtues do you most admire in a man asked sallie 
 courage and honesty 
 now my turn said fred as his hand came last 
 give it to him whispered laurie to jo who nodded and asked at once 
 you cheat at croquet 
 well yes a little bit 
 good you take your story out of the sea lion said laurie 
 rather 
 you think the english nation perfect in every respect asked sallie 
 i should be ashamed of myself if i 
 a true john bull now miss sallie you shall have a chance without waiting to draw harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you think you are something of a flirt said laurie as jo nodded to fred as a sign that peace was declared 
 you impertinent boy of course not exclaimed sallie with an air that proved the contrary 
 what do you hate most asked fred 
 spiders and rice pudding 
 what do you like best asked jo 
 dancing and french gloves 
 well i think truth is a very silly play have a sensible game of authors to refresh our minds proposed jo 
 ned frank and the little girls joined in this and while it went on the three elders sat apart talking miss kate took out her sketch again and margaret watched her while mr brooke lay on the grass with a book which he did not read 
 how beautifully you do it i wish i could draw said meg with mingled admiration and regret in her voice 
 why you learn i should think you had taste and talent for it replied miss kate graciously 
 i time 
 your mamma prefers other accomplishments i fancy so did mine but i proved to her that i had talent by taking a few lessons privately and then she was quite willing i should go on you do the same with your governess 
 i have none 
 i forgot young ladies in america go to school more than with us very fine schools they are too papa says you go to a private one i suppose 
 i go at all i am a governess myself 
 oh indeed said miss kate but she might as well have said dear me how dreadful for her tone implied it and something in her face made meg color and wish she had not been so frank 
 mr brooke looked up and said quickly young ladies in america love independence as much as their ancestors did and are admired and respected for supporting themselves 
 oh yes of course very nice and proper in them to do so we have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility because being the daughters of gentlemen they are both well bred and accomplished you know said miss kate in a patronizing tone that hurt pride and made her work seem not only more distasteful but degrading 
 did the german song suit miss march inquired mr brooke breaking an awkward pause 
 oh yes it was very sweet and much obliged to whoever translated it for me and downcast face brightened as she spoke 
 you read german asked miss kate with a look of surprise 
 not very well my father who taught me is away and i get on very fast alone for no one to correct my pronunciation 
 try a little now here is mary stuart and a tutor who loves to teach and mr brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile 
 so hard afraid to try said meg grateful but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her 
 read a bit to encourage you and miss kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner 
 mr brooke made no comment as she returned the book to meg who said innocently i thought it was poetry some of it is try this passage 
 there was a queer smile about mr mouth as he opened at poor lament 
 meg obediently following the long which her new tutor used to point with read slowly and timidly unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice down the page went the green guide and presently forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene meg read as if alone giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen if she had seen the brown eyes then she would have stopped short but she never looked up and the lesson was not spoiled for her 
 very well indeed said mr brooke as she paused quite ignoring her many mistakes and looking as if he did indeed love to teach 
 miss kate put up her glass and having taken a survey of the little tableau before her shut her sketch book saying with condescension a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader i advise you to learn for german is a valuable accomplishment to teachers i must look after grace she is romping and miss kate strolled away adding to herself with a shrug i come to chaperone a governess though she is young and pretty what odd people these yankees are afraid laurie will be quite spoiled among them 
 i forgot that english people rather turn up their noses at governesses and treat them as we do said meg looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression 
 tutors also have rather a hard time of it there as i know to my sorrow no place like america for us workers miss margaret and mr brooke looked so contented and cheerful that meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot 
 glad i live in it then i like my work but i get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all so i complain i only wished i liked teaching as you do 
 i think you would if you had laurie for a pupil i shall be very sorry to lose him next year said mr brooke busily punching holes in the turf 
 going to college i suppose lips asked the question but her eyes added and what becomes of you 
 yes high time he went for he is ready and as soon as he is off i shall turn soldier i am needed 
 i am glad of that exclaimed meg i should think every young man would want to go though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home she added sorrowfully 
 i have neither and very few friends to care whether i live or die said mr brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up like a little grave 
 laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you said meg heartily 
 thank you that sounds pleasant began mr brooke looking cheerful again but before he could finish his speech ned mounted on the old horse came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies and there was no more quiet that day 
 you love to ride asked grace of amy as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others led by ned 
 
 i dote upon it my sister meg used to ride when papa was rich but we keep any horses now except ellen tree added amy laughing 
 tell me about ellen tree is it a donkey asked grace curiously 
 why you see jo is crazy about horses and so am i but only got an old sidesaddle and no horse out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch so jo put the saddle on it fixed some reins on the part that turns up and we bounce away on ellen tree whenever we like 
 how funny laughed grace i have a pony at home and ride nearly every day in the park with fred and kate very nice for my friends go too and the row is full of ladies and gentlemen 
 dear how charming i hope i shall go abroad some day but rather go to rome than the row said amy who had not the remotest idea what the row was and have asked for the world 
 frank sitting just behind the little girls heard what they were saying and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics beth who was collecting the scattered author cards looked up and said in her shy yet friendly way afraid you are tired can i do anything for you 
 talk to me please dull sitting by myself answered frank who had evidently been used to being made much of at home 
 if he asked her to deliver a latin oration it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful beth but there was no place to run to no jo to hide behind now and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try 
 what do you like to talk about she asked fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up 
 well i like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting said frank who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength 
 my heart what shall i do i know anything about them thought beth and forgetting the misfortune in her flurry she said hoping to make him talk i never saw any hunting but i suppose you know all about it 
 i did once but i can never hunt again for i got hurt leaping a confounded gate so there are no more horses and hounds for me said frank with a sigh that made beth hate herself for her innocent blunder 
 your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes she said turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys books in which jo delighted 
 buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory and in her eagerness to amuse another beth forgot herself and was quite unconscious of her sisters surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys against whom she had begged protection 
 bless her heart she pities him so she is good to him aid jo beaming at her from the croquet ground 
 i always said she was a little saint added meg as if there could be no further doubt of it 
 i heard frank laugh so much for ever so long said grace to amy as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups 
 my sister beth is a very fastidious girl when she likes to be said amy well pleased at success she meant facinating but as grace know the exact meaning of either word fastidious sounded well and made a good impression 
 an impromptu circus fox and geese and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon at sunset the tent was struck hampers packed wickets pulled up boats loaded and the whole party floated down the river singing at the tops of their voices ned getting sentimental warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain 
 alone alone ah woe alone 
 and at the lines 
 we each are young we each have a heart oh why should we stand thus coldly apart 
 he looked at meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song 
 how can you be so cruel to me he whispered under cover of a lively chorus kept close to that englishwoman all day and now you snub me 
 i mean to but you looked so funny i really help it replied meg passing over the first part of his reproach for it was quite true that she had shunned him remembering the moffat party and the talk after it 
 ned was offended and turned to sallie for consolation saying to her rather pettishly there a bit of flirt in that girl is there 
 not a particle but a dear returned sallie defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings 
 not a stricken deer anyway said ned trying to be witty and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do 
 on the lawn where it had gathered the little party separated with cordial good nights and for the vaughns were going to canada as the four sisters went home through the garden miss kate looked after them saying without the patronizing tone in her voice in spite of their demonstrative manners american girls are very nice when one knows them 
 i quite agree with you said mr brooke

 ambassador 
 look at those men they were supposed to be inconspicuous 
 
 general 
 you asked for plain clothes 
 
 the ambassador glances at him with raised eyebrows 
 
 in the city joe drives along the streets on a little vespa scooter princess ann riding on the back her arms wrapped around his waist she looks out smiling at the sights as they drive to the colliseum looming up before them 
 they walk inside the colliseum accompanied by a guide who points to the structure instructing ann joe follows just behind them being joined now by irving they walk to the edge looking down over the centre of the structure ann listens to guide watched on by joe and irving who lights up a cigarette holding the lighter irving signals secretly to joe who acknowledges him with a private signal of his own 
 back on the streets of rome and joe and ann ride along on the scooter followed by irving in a small car irving overtakes them and as joe points out the sights to ann he takes pictures out of the back of the vehicle barely regaining control of the vehicle afterwards 
 joe and ann drive to a large intersection where the traffic is directed by a warden who blows his whistle at them nearby irving pulls up his eye on joe and ann joe and ann get off the scooter as joe goes to talk to the warden irving gets out of his car peering round a streeet corner at them a camera in hand 
 seeing joe busy ann gets back onto the scooter herself curious to test out the feel of the handlebars irving snaps a picture of her as she gingerly tests the controls suddenly ann lets out a shriek of fright as the scooter takes off joe turns round and excusing himself from the warden goes after her irving looks on helpless 
 ann drives the scooter erratically along the side of the road scaring some pedestrians who are crossing the road who leap back onto the pavement joe running after her calls out to her to stop irving runs back to the car ann in sheer delight keeps driving as joe laughing jumps on the back of the scooter the scooter suddenly goes at speed down the street turning a corner scaring more pedestrians out of the way 
 
 joe 
 putting his hands on the handlebars 
 let me take this let me take over 
 
 ann 
 pushing his hands out of the way putting hers on top 
 no no no i i can do it 
 the scooter drives into the traffic going slower now and delicately missing a car and bicycle a tram honks at them as they drive across its path and it swerves to avoid them irving follows them with difficulty through the traffic his visibility impaired as he passes through a stream of water coming from a hydrant 
 ann mounts the pavement driving between some people at a stall through a painting one of them is showing to the others they drive through a sidewalk cafe weaving between the tables as the diners get up outraged at the disturbance ann continues on knocking over a workbench where a large man is setting up his equipment children run in to help him pick the materials up blocking car in the process ann drives chaotically around a roundabout scaring a woman who screams and jumps out of the way dropping her groceries 
 police whistles ring out as the polizia get into their cars joining two motorbikes which give chase to ann and scooter ann and joe tear away down the street followed the motorbikes their sirens wailing 
 sometime later and ann joe and irving stand in a room before a judge sitting at a table in front of the judge are arranged the various victims of ann and escapade giving their testimonies and presenting their damaged goods as evidence ann and joe answer the various questions of the judge then joe presents him with his holding his head awkwardly back for the judge since that way it better matches the photo the judge looks at the front of the it says american news service joe tells the judge something putting his arm around ann to perhaps better convince him irving intervenes telling the judge something or other although the judge looks unimpressed with what he has to say joe points out something to the judge on what he is looking at on his desk to which the judge reacts favorably irving ann and leave joe telling them something or other saying goodbye to the witnesses and they smile back 
 
 the three leave the police station laughing stopping quickly on seeing the guard posted outside 
 
 irving 
 as they walk by the guard 
 oh 
 
 coughs 
 going straight from now on 
 they walk out of earshot then stop ann turning to joe puzzled 
 
 ann 
 american news service what did he mean 
 
 joe 
 huh oh well you know say with the press and you can get away with anything

 joe 
 he looks worried for a moment then finds his nerve

 joe takes a step forward moving his hand onto the lip of the mouth ann unblinking leans foward from the tension joe slides his fingers into the mouth and then his hand up to the wrist suddenly he gives out a loud cry pulling back as if the mouth has hold of his hand and let go ann screams and rushes to his side pulling at him from behind joe takes out his hand apprently severed at the wrist and ann screams in fright putting her hands over her face smiling he lets his hand spring open out of his sleeve 
 
 ann 
 laughing as joe takes her in his arms as she throws herself toward him playfully beating her fists at him

 later on irving pulls up on a quiet street 
 
 irving 
 to joe as he stands up to climb out of the car 
 park at the corner 
 joe opens door and she climbs out joe is about to climb out of the car but seeing ann holding the door for him bends down under the rim of the door barely squeezing through ann smiles at him as he struggles out as irving drives away joe follows ann as she walks across the wide footpath stopping before the huge wall covered top to bottom with small plaques a little further up the footpath there is a woman kneeling down at a small prayer bench who stands up crossing herself before leaving 
 
 ann 
 what do they mean all these inscriptions 
 
 joe 
 walking with her alongside the wall 
 well each one represents a wish fulfilled all started during the war when there was an air out here a man with his four children was caught in the street they ran over against the wall 
 
 pointing behind them 
 right there for shelter prayed for safety bombs fell very close but no one was hurt later on the man came back and he put up the first of these tablets since then become sort of a shrine people come and whenever their wishes are granted 
 
 stopping turning round to look back 
 they put up another one of these little plaques 
 
 ann 
 looking back along the wall

 joe 
 taking her arm directing her over to the wall 
 read some of the inscriptions 
 
 irving stands beside the wall holding his camera lighting another cigarette she walks over and looks at some of the plaques for a moment

 ambassador 
 look at those men they were supposed to be inconspicuous 
 
 general

 the ambassador glances at him with raised eyebrows 
 
 in the city joe drives along the streets on a little vespa scooter princess ann riding on the back her arms wrapped around his waist she looks out smiling at the sights as they drive to the colliseum looming up before them 
 they walk inside the colliseum accompanied by a guide who points to the structure instructing ann joe follows just behind them being joined now by irving they walk to the edge looking down over the centre of the structure ann listens to guide watched on by joe and irving who lights up a cigarette holding the lighter irving signals secretly to joe who acknowledges him with a private signal of his own 
 back on the streets of rome and joe and ann ride along on the scooter followed by irving in a small car irving overtakes them and as joe points out the sights to ann he takes pictures out of the back of the vehicle barely regaining control of the vehicle afterwards 
 joe and ann drive to a large intersection where the traffic is directed by a warden who blows his whistle at them nearby irving pulls up his eye on joe and ann joe and ann get off the scooter as joe goes to talk to the warden irving gets out of his car peering round a streeet corner at them a camera in hand 
 seeing joe busy ann gets back onto the scooter herself curious to test out the feel of the handlebars irving snaps a picture of her as she gingerly tests the controls suddenly ann lets out a shriek of fright as the scooter takes off joe turns round and excusing himself from the warden goes after her irving looks on helpless 
 ann drives the scooter erratically along the side of the road scaring some pedestrians who are crossing the road who leap back onto the pavement joe running after her calls out to her to stop irving runs back to the car ann in sheer delight keeps driving as joe laughing jumps on the back of the scooter the scooter suddenly goes at speed down the street turning a corner scaring more pedestrians out of the way 
 
 joe 
 putting his hands on the handlebars 
 let me take this let me take over 
 
 ann 
 pushing his hands out of the way putting hers on top 
 no no no i i can do it 
 the scooter drives into the traffic going slower now and delicately missing a car and bicycle a tram honks at them as they drive across its path and it swerves to avoid them irving follows them with difficulty through the traffic his visibility impaired as he passes through a stream of water coming from a hydrant 
 ann mounts the pavement driving between some people at a stall through a painting one of them is showing to the others they drive through a sidewalk cafe weaving between the tables as the diners get up outraged at the disturbance ann continues on knocking over a workbench where a large man is setting up his equipment children run in to help him pick the materials up blocking car in the process ann drives chaotically around a roundabout scaring a woman who screams and jumps out of the way dropping her groceries 
 police whistles ring out as the polizia get into their cars joining two motorbikes which give chase to ann and scooter ann and joe tear away down the street followed the motorbikes their sirens wailing 
 sometime later and ann joe and irving stand in a room before a judge sitting at a table in front of the judge are arranged the various victims of ann and escapade giving their testimonies and presenting their damaged goods as evidence ann and joe answer the various questions of the judge then joe presents him with his holding his head awkwardly back for the judge since that way it better matches the photo the judge looks at the front of the it says american news service joe tells the judge something putting his arm around ann to perhaps better convince him irving intervenes telling the judge something or other although the judge looks unimpressed with what he has to say joe points out something to the judge on what he is looking at on his desk to which the judge reacts favorably irving ann and leave joe telling them something or other saying goodbye to the witnesses and they smile back 
 
 the three leave the police station laughing stopping quickly on seeing the guard posted outside

 red juice from the inside that it could be a dream 
 cypher

 cypher

 a fork stabs the cube of meat and we follow it up to the 
 face of cypher

 the restaurant is located on the top floor of a chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices

lionfish nov chapter twelve the polyjuice potioncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 they stepped off the stone staircase at the top and professor mcgonagall rapped on the door it opened silently and they entered professor mcgonagall told harry to wait and left him there alone 
 
 harry looked around one thing was certain of all the harry had visited so far this year was by far the most interesting if he been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it 
 
 it was a large and beautiful circular room full of funny little noises a number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke the walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames there was also an enormous desk and sitting on a shelf behind it a shabby tattered hat the sorting hat 
 
 harry hesitated he cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls surely it hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again just to see just to make sure it had put him in the right house 
 
 he walked quietly around the desk lifted the hat from its shelf and lowered it slowly onto his head it was much too large and slipped down over his eyes just as it had done the last time put it on harry stared at the black inside of the hat waiting then a small voice said in his ear bee in your bonnet harry potter 
 
 er yes harry muttered er sorry to bother you i wanted to ask 
 
 been wondering whether i put you in the right house said the hat smartly yes you were particularly difficult to place but i stand by what i said before heart leapt you would have done well in slytherin 
 
 stomach plummeted he grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off it hung limply in his hand grubby and faded harry pushed it back onto its shelf feeling sick 
 
 wrong he said aloud to the still and silent hat it move harry backed away watching it then a strange gagging noise behind him made him wheel around 
 
 he alone after all standing on a golden perch behind the door was a bird that resembled a turkey harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back making its gagging noise again harry thought it looked very ill its eyes were dull and even as harry watched a couple more feathers fell out of its tail 
 
 harry was just thinking that all he needed was for pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it when the bird burst into flames 
 
 harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk he looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but see one the bird meanwhile had become a fireball it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor 
 
 the office door opened dumbledore came in looking very somber 
 
 professor harry gasped your bird i do anything he just caught fire 
 
 to astonishment dumbledore smiled 
 
 about time too he said been looking dreadful for days been telling him to get a move on 
 
 he chuckled at the stunned look on face 
 
 fawkes is a phoenix harry phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes watch him 
 
 harry looked down in time to see a tiny wrinkled newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes it was quite as ugly as the old one 
 
 a shame you had to see him on a burning day said dumbledore seating himself behind his desk really very handsome most of the time wonderful red and gold plumage fascinating creatures phoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears have healing powers and they make highly faithful pets 
 
 in the shock of fawkes catching fire harry had forgotten what he was there for but it all came back to him as dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed harry with his penetrating stare 
 
 before dumbledore could speak another word however the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and hagrid burst in a wild look in his eyes his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand 
 
 it professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently i was him seconds before that kid was found he never had time sir 
 
 dumbledore tried to say something but hagrid went ranting on waving the rooster around in his agitation sending feathers everywhere 
 
 it bin him swear it in front ministry if i have to 
 
 hagrid i 
 
 got the wrong boy sir i know harry never 
 
 hagrid said dumbledore loudly i do not think that harry attacked those people 
 
 oh said hagrid the rooster falling limply at his side right wait outside then headmaster 
 
 and he stomped out looking embarrassed 
 
 you think it was me professor harry repeated hopefully as dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk 
 
 no harry i said dumbledore though his face was somber again but i still want to talk to you 
 
 harry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him the tips of his long fingers together 
 
 i must ask you harry whether there is anything like to tell me he said gently anything at all 
 
 harry know what to say he thought of malfoy shouting be next mudbloods and of the polyjuice potion simmering away in moaning bathroom then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what ron had said hearing voices no one else can hear a good sign even in the wizarding world he thought too about what everyone was saying about him and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with salazar slytherin 
 
 no said harry there anything professor 
 
 the double attack on justin and nearly headless nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic curiously it was nearly headless fate that seemed to worry people most what could possibly do that to a ghost people asked each other what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead there was almost a stampede to book seats on the hogwarts express so that students could go home for christmas 
 
 at this rate be the only ones left ron told harry and hermione us malfoy crabbe and goyle what a jolly holiday going to be 
 
 crabbe and goyle who always did whatever malfoy did had signed up to stay over the holidays too but harry was glad that most people were leaving he was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison tired of all the muttering pointing and hissing as he passed 
 
 fred and george however found all this very funny they went out of their way to march ahead of harry down the corridors shouting make way for the heir of slytherin seriously evil wizard coming through 
 
 percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior 
 
 it is not a laughing matter he said coldly 
 
 oh get out of the way percy said fred in a hurry 
 
 yeah off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant said george chortling 
 
 ginny find it amusing either 
 
 oh she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who he was planning to attack next or when george pretended to ward harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met 
 
 harry mind it made him feel better that fred and george at least thought the idea of his being heir was quite ludicrous but their antics seemed to be aggravating draco malfoy who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it 
 
 because bursting to say really him said ron knowingly you know how he hates anyone beating him at anything and getting all the credit for his dirty work 
 
 not for long said hermione in a satisfied tone the polyjuice nearly ready be getting the truth out of him any day now 
 
 at last the term ended and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle harry found it peaceful rather than gloomy and enjoyed the fact that he hermione and the weasleys had the run of gryffindor tower which meant they could play exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone and practice dueling in private fred george and ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit bill in egypt with mr and mrs weasley percy who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior spend much time in the gryffindor common room he had already told them pompously that he was only staying over christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time 
 
 christmas morning dawned cold and white harry and ron the only ones left in their dormitory were woken very early by hermione who burst in fully dressed and carrying presents for them both 
 
 wake up she said loudly pulling back the curtains at the window 
 
 hermione not supposed to be in here said ron shielding his eyes against the light 
 
 merry christmas to you too said hermione throwing him his present been up for nearly an hour adding more lacewings to the potion ready 
 
 harry sat up suddenly wide awake 
 
 are you sure 
 
 positive said hermione shifting scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of if going to do it i say it should be tonight 
 
 at that moment hedwig swooped into the room carrying a very small package in her beak 
 
 hello said harry happily as she landed on his bed are you speaking to me again 
 
 she nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him which turned out to be from the dursleys they had sent harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether be able to stay at hogwarts for the summer vacation too 
 
 the rest of christmas presents were far more satisfactory hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge which harry decided to soften by the fire before eating ron had given him a book called flying with the cannons a book of interesting facts about his favorite quidditch team and hermione had bought him a luxurious quill harry opened the last present to find a new sweater from mrs weasley and a large plum cake he read her card with a fresh surge of guilt thinking about mr car which been seen since its crash with the whomping willow and the bout of he and ron were planning next 
 
 no one not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion later could fail to enjoy christmas dinner at hogwarts 
 
 the great hall looked magnificent not only were there a dozen christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling but enchanted snow was falling warm and dry from the ceiling dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed percy who noticed that fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead kept asking them all what they were sniggering at harry even care that draco malfoy was making loud snide remark about his new sweater from the slytherin table with a bit of luck malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few 
 
 harry and ron had barely finished their third helpings of christmas pudding when hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening 
 
 we still need a bit of the people changing into said hermione as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent and obviously be best if you can get something of and malfoys best friends tell them anything and we also need to make sure the real crabbe and goyle burst in on us while interrogating him 
 
 got it all worked out she went on smoothly ignoring and stupefied faces she held up two plump chocolate cakes filled these with a simple sleeping draught all you have to do is make sure crabbe and goyle find them you know how greedy they are bound to eat them once asleep pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet 
 
 harry and ron looked incredulously at each other 
 
 hermione i think 
 
 that could go seriously wrong 
 
 but hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one professor mcgonagall sometimes had 
 
 the potion will be useless without and hair she said sternly you do want to investigate malfoy you 
 
 oh all right all right said harry but what about you whose hair are you ripping out 
 
 already got mine said hermione brightly pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it remember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at the dueling club she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me and gone home for christmas so just have to tell the slytherins decided to come back 
 
 when hermione had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potion again ron turned to harry with a expression 
 
 have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong 
 
 but to and utter amazement stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as hermione had said they lurked in the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for crabbe and goyle who had remained alone at the slytherin table shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters when they spotted crabbe and goyle coming out of the great hall harry and ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door 
 
 how thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to goyle and grabbed them grinning stupidly they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths for a moment both of them chewed greedily looks of triumph on their faces then without the smallest change of expression they both keeled over backward onto the floor 
 
 by far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered forehead and ron pulled out several of hairs they also stole their shoes because their own were far too small for crabbe and feet then still stunned at what they had just done they sprinted up to moaning bathroom 
 
 they could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which hermione was stirring the cauldron pulling their robes up over their faces harry and ron knocked softly on the door 
 
 hermione 
 
 they heard the scrape of the lock and hermione emerged and looking anxious behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling glutinous potion three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat 
 
 did you get them hermione asked breathlessly 
 
 harry showed her hair 
 
 good and i sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry hermione said holding up a small sack need bigger sizes once crabbe and goyle 
 
 the three of them stared into the cauldron close up the potion looked like thick dark mud bubbling sluggishly 
 
 sure done everything right said hermione nervously rereading the splotched page of moste potente potions it looks like the book says it should once drunk it have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves 
 
 now what ron whispered 
 
 we separate it into three glasses and add the hairs 
 
 hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses then her hand trembling she shook millicent hair out of its bottle into the first glass 
 
 the potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly a second later it had turned a sick sort of yellow 
 
 urgh essence of millicent bulstrode said ron eyeing it with loathing bet it tastes disgusting 
 
 add yours then said hermione 
 
 harry dropped hair into the middle glass and ron put into the last one both glasses hissed and frothed turned the khaki color of a booger a dark murky brown 
 
 hang on said harry as ron and hermione reached for their glasses better not all drink them in here once we turn into crabbe and goyle we fit and millicent no pixie 
 
 good thinking said ron unlocking the door take separate stalls 
 
 careful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion harry slipped into the middle stall 
 
 ready he called 
 
 ready came and voices 
 
 one two three 
 
 pinching his nose harry drank the potion down in two large gulps it tasted like overcooked cabbage 
 
 immediately his insides started writhing as though just swallowed live snakes doubled up he wondered whether he was going to be sick then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes next bringing him gasping to all fours came a horrible melting feeling as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax and before his eyes his hands began to grow the fingers thickened the nails broadened the knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small 
 
 as suddenly as it had started everything stopped harry lay facedown on the floor listening to myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet with difficulty he kicked off his shoes and stood up so this was what it felt like being goyle his large hand trembling he pulled off his old robes which were hanging a foot above his ankles pulled on the spare ones and laced up boatlike shoes he reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles low on his forehead then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because goyle obviously need them he took them off and called are you two okay low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth 
 
 yeah came the deep grunt of crabbe from his right 
 
 harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror goyle stared back at him out of dull deepset eyes harry scratched his ear so did goyle 
 
 door opened they stared at each other except that he looked pale and shocked ron was indistinguishable from crabbe from the haircut to the long gorilla arms 
 
 this is unbelievable said ron approaching the mirror and prodding flat nose unbelievable 
 
 better get going said harry loosening the watch that was cutting into thick wrist still got to find out where the slytherin common room is i only hope we can find someone to follow 
 
 ron who had been gazing at harry said you know how bizarre it is to see goyle thinking he banged on door we need to go 
 
 a voice answered him 
 
 i i think going to come after all you go on without me 
 
 hermione we know millicent ugly no going to know you 
 
 no really i think come you two hurry up wasting time 
 
 harry looked at ron bewildered 
 
 that looks more like goyle said ron how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question 
 
 hermione are you okay said harry through the door 
 
 fine fine go on 
 
 harry looked at his watch five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed 
 
 meet you back here all right he said 
 
 harry and ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully checked that the coast was clear and set off 
 
 swing your arms like that harry muttered to ron 
 
 eh 
 
 crabbe holds them sort of stiff 
 
 this 
 
 yeah better 
 
 they went down the marble staircase all they needed now was a slytherin that they could follow to the slytherin common room but there was nobody around 
 
 any ideas muttered harry 
 
 the slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there said ron nodding at the entrance to the dungeons the words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long curly hair emerged from the entrance 
 
 excuse me said ron hurrying up to her forgotten the way to our common room 
 
 i beg your pardon said the girl stiffly our common room a ravenclaw 
 
 she walked away looking suspiciously back at them 
 
 harry and ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as and huge feet hit the floor feeling that this going to be as easy as they had hoped 
 
 the labyrinthine passages were deserted they walked deeper and deeper under the school constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left after a quarter of an hour just when they were getting desperate they heard a sudden movement ahead 
 
 ha said ron excitedly one of them now 
 
 the figure was emerging from a side room as they hurried nearer however their hearts sank it a slytherin it was percy 
 
 you doing down here said ron in surprise 
 
 percy looked affronted 
 
 that he said stiffly is none of your business crabbe it 
 
 wh oh yeah said ron 
 
 well get off to your dormitories said percy sternly not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days 
 
 you are ron pointed out 
 
 i said percy drawing himself up am a prefect about to attack me 
 
 a voice suddenly echoed behind harry and ron draco malfoy was strolling toward them and for the first time in his life harry was pleased to see him 
 
 there you are he drawled looking at them have you two been pigging out in the great hall all this time been looking for you i want to show you something really funny 
 
 malfoy glanced witheringly at percy 
 
 and you doing down here weasley he sneered 
 
 percy looked outraged 
 
 you want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect he said i like your attitude 
 
 malfoy sneered and motioned for harry and ron to follow him harry almost said something apologetic to percy but caught himself just in time he and ron hurried after malfoy who said as they turned into the next passage that peter weasley 
 
 percy ron corrected him automatically 
 
 whatever said malfoy noticed him sneaking around a lot lately and i bet i know what up to he thinks going to catch heir 
 
 he gave a short derisive laugh harry and ron exchanged excited looks 
 
 malfoy paused by a stretch of bare damp stone wall 
 
 the new password again he said to harry 
 
 er said harry 
 
 oh yeah said malfoy not listening and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open malfoy marched through it and harry and ron followed him 
 
 the slytherin common room was a long low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round greenish lamps were hanging on chains a fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them and several slytherins were silhouetted around it in chairs 
 
 wait here said malfoy to harry and ron motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire go and get it my just sent it to me 
 
 wondering what malfoy was going to show them harry and ron sat down doing their best to look at home 
 
 malfoy came back a minute later holding what looked like a newspaper clipping he thrust it under nose 
 
 give you a laugh he said 
 
 harry saw eyes widen in shock he read the clipping quickly gave a very forced laugh and handed it to harry 
 
 it had been clipped out of the daily prophet and it said 
 
 inquiry at the ministry of magic 
 
 arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office was today fined fifty galleons for bewitching a muggle car 
 
 mr lucius malfoy a governor of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year called today for mr resignation weasley has brought the ministry into disrepute mr malfoy told our reporter he is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous muggle protection act should be scrapped immediately 
 
 mr weasley was unavailable for comment although his wife told reporters to clear off or set the family ghoul on them 
 
 well said malfoy impatiently as harry handed the clipping back to him you think funny 
 
 ha ha said harry bleakly 
 
 arthur weasley loves muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them said malfoy scornfully never know the weasleys were the way they behave 
 
 or rather face was contorted with fury 
 
 up with you crabbe snapped malfoy 
 
 stomachache ron grunted 
 
 well go up to the hospital wing and give all those mudbloods a kick from me said malfoy snickering you know surprised the daily prophet reported all these attacks yet he went on thoughtfully i suppose trying to hush it all up be sacked if it stop soon always said old the worst thing ever happened to this place he loves a decent headmaster would let slime like that creevey in 
 
 malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of colin potter can i have your picture potter can i have your autograph can i lick your shoes please potter 
 
 he dropped his hands and looked at harry and ron 
 
 the matter with you two 
 
 far too late harry and ron forced themselves to laugh but malfoy seemed satisfied perhaps crabbe and goyle were always slow on the uptake 
 
 saint potter the said malfoy slowly another one with no proper wizard feeling or he go around with that jumped up granger mudblood and people think heir 
 
 harry and ron waited with bated breath malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him but then i wish i knew who it is said malfoy petulantly i could help them 
 
 jaw dropped so that crabbe looked even more clueless than usual fortunately malfoy notice and harry thinking fast said you must have some idea behind it all 
 
 you know i goyle how many times do i have to tell you snapped malfoy and father tell me anything about the last time the chamber was opened either of course it was fifty years ago so it was before his time but he knows all about it and he says that it was all kept quiet and look suspicious if i know too much about it but i know one thing last time the chamber of secrets was opened a mudblood died so i bet a matter of time before one of killed this time i hope granger he said with relish 
 
 ron was clenching gigantic fists feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if ron punched malfoy harry shot him a warning look and said know if the person who opened the chamber last time was caught 
 
 oh yeah whoever it was was expelled said malfoy probably still in azkaban 
 
 azkaban said harry puzzled 
 
 azkaban the wizard prison goyle said malfoy looking at him in disbelief honestly if you were any slower be going backward 
 
 he shifted restlessly in his chair and said father says to keep my head down and let the heir of slytherin get on with it he says the school needs ridding of all the mudblood filth but not to get mixed up in it of course got a lot on his plate at the moment you know the ministry of magic raided our manor last week 
 
 harry tried to force dull face into a look of concern 
 
 yeah said malfoy luckily they find much got some very valuable dark arts stuff but luckily got our own secret chamber under the floor 
 
 ho said ron 
 
 malfoy looked at him so did harry ron blushed even his hair was turning red his nose was also slowly lengthening their hour was up ron was turning back into himself and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving harry he must be too 
 
 they both jumped to their feet 
 
 medicine for my stomach ron grunted and without further ado they sprinted the length of the slytherin common room hurled themselves at the stone wall and dashed up the passage hoping against hope that malfoy noticed anything harry could feel his feet slipping around in huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where locked crabbe and goyle leaving their shoes outside the closet door they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward moaning bathroom 
 
 well it a complete waste of time ron panted closing the bathroom door behind them i know we still found out doing the attacks but going to write to dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the room 
 
 harry checked his face in the cracked mirror he was back to normal he put his glasses on as ron hammered on the door of stall 
 
 hermione come out got loads to tell you 
 
 go away hermione squeaked 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other 
 
 the matter said ron you must be back to normal by now we are 
 
 but moaning myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door harry had never seen her looking so happy 
 
 ooooooh wait till you see she said awful 
 
 they heard the lock slide back and hermione emerged sobbing her robes pulled up over her head 
 
 up said ron uncertainly have you still got nose or something 
 
 hermione let her robes fall and ron backed into the sink 
 
 her face was covered in black fur her eyes had turned yellow and there were long pointed ears poking through her hair 
 
 it was a hair she howled bulstrode have a cat and the supposed to be used for animal transformations 
 
 said ron 
 
 be teased something dreadful said myrtle happily 
 
 okay hermione said harry quickly take you up to the hospital wing madam pomfrey never asks too many questions 
 
 it took a long time to persuade hermione to leave the bathroom moaning myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw wait till everyone finds out got a tail 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelve the polyjuice potioncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 they stepped off the stone staircase at the top and professor mcgonagall rapped on the door it opened silently and they entered professor mcgonagall told harry to wait and left him there alone 
 
 harry looked around one thing was certain of all the harry had visited so far this year was by far the most interesting if he been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it 
 
 it was a large and beautiful circular room full of funny little noises a number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke the walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames there was also an enormous desk and sitting on a shelf behind it a shabby tattered hat the sorting hat 
 
 harry hesitated he cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls surely it hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again just to see just to make sure it had put him in the right house 
 
 he walked quietly around the desk lifted the hat from its shelf and lowered it slowly onto his head it was much too large and slipped down over his eyes just as it had done the last time put it on harry stared at the black inside of the hat waiting then a small voice said in his ear bee in your bonnet harry potter 
 
 er yes harry muttered er sorry to bother you i wanted to ask 
 
 been wondering whether i put you in the right house said the hat smartly yes you were particularly difficult to place but i stand by what i said before heart leapt you would have done well in slytherin 
 
 stomach plummeted he grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off it hung limply in his hand grubby and faded harry pushed it back onto its shelf feeling sick 
 
 wrong he said aloud to the still and silent hat it move harry backed away watching it then a strange gagging noise behind him made him wheel around 
 
 he alone after all standing on a golden perch behind the door was a bird that resembled a turkey harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back making its gagging noise again harry thought it looked very ill its eyes were dull and even as harry watched a couple more feathers fell out of its tail 
 
 harry was just thinking that all he needed was for pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it when the bird burst into flames 
 
 harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk he looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but see one the bird meanwhile had become a fireball it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor 
 
 the office door opened dumbledore came in looking very somber 
 
 professor harry gasped your bird i do anything he just caught fire 
 
 to astonishment dumbledore smiled 
 
 about time too he said been looking dreadful for days been telling him to get a move on 
 
 he chuckled at the stunned look on face 
 
 fawkes is a phoenix harry phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes watch him 
 
 harry looked down in time to see a tiny wrinkled newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes it was quite as ugly as the old one 
 
 a shame you had to see him on a burning day said dumbledore seating himself behind his desk really very handsome most of the time wonderful red and gold plumage fascinating creatures phoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears have healing powers and they make highly faithful pets 
 
 in the shock of fawkes catching fire harry had forgotten what he was there for but it all came back to him as dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed harry with his penetrating stare 
 
 before dumbledore could speak another word however the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and hagrid burst in a wild look in his eyes his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand 
 
 it professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently i was him seconds before that kid was found he never had time sir 
 
 dumbledore tried to say something but hagrid went ranting on waving the rooster around in his agitation sending feathers everywhere 
 
 it bin him swear it in front ministry if i have to 
 
 hagrid i 
 
 got the wrong boy sir i know harry never 
 
 hagrid said dumbledore loudly i do not think that harry attacked those people 
 
 oh said hagrid the rooster falling limply at his side right wait outside then headmaster 
 
 and he stomped out looking embarrassed 
 
 you think it was me professor harry repeated hopefully as dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk 
 
 no harry i said dumbledore though his face was somber again but i still want to talk to you 
 
 harry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him the tips of his long fingers together 
 
 i must ask you harry whether there is anything like to tell me he said gently anything at all 
 
 harry know what to say he thought of malfoy shouting be next mudbloods and of the polyjuice potion simmering away in moaning bathroom then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what ron had said hearing voices no one else can hear a good sign even in the wizarding world he thought too about what everyone was saying about him and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with salazar slytherin 
 
 no said harry there anything professor 
 
 the double attack on justin and nearly headless nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic curiously it was nearly headless fate that seemed to worry people most what could possibly do that to a ghost people asked each other what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead there was almost a stampede to book seats on the hogwarts express so that students could go home for christmas 
 
 at this rate be the only ones left ron told harry and hermione us malfoy crabbe and goyle what a jolly holiday going to be 
 
 crabbe and goyle who always did whatever malfoy did had signed up to stay over the holidays too but harry was glad that most people were leaving he was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison tired of all the muttering pointing and hissing as he passed 
 
 fred and george however found all this very funny they went out of their way to march ahead of harry down the corridors shouting make way for the heir of slytherin seriously evil wizard coming through 
 
 percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior 
 
 it is not a laughing matter he said coldly 
 
 oh get out of the way percy said fred in a hurry 
 
 yeah off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant said george chortling 
 
 ginny find it amusing either 
 
 oh she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who he was planning to attack next or when george pretended to ward harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met 
 
 harry mind it made him feel better that fred and george at least thought the idea of his being heir was quite ludicrous but their antics seemed to be aggravating draco malfoy who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it 
 
 because bursting to say really him said ron knowingly you know how he hates anyone beating him at anything and getting all the credit for his dirty work 
 
 not for long said hermione in a satisfied tone the polyjuice nearly ready be getting the truth out of him any day now 
 
 at last the term ended and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle harry found it peaceful rather than gloomy and enjoyed the fact that he hermione and the weasleys had the run of gryffindor tower which meant they could play exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone and practice dueling in private fred george and ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit bill in egypt with mr and mrs weasley percy who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior spend much time in the gryffindor common room he had already told them pompously that he was only staying over christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time 
 
 christmas morning dawned cold and white harry and ron the only ones left in their dormitory were woken very early by hermione who burst in fully dressed and carrying presents for them both 
 
 wake up she said loudly pulling back the curtains at the window 
 
 hermione not supposed to be in here said ron shielding his eyes against the light 
 
 merry christmas to you too said hermione throwing him his present been up for nearly an hour adding more lacewings to the potion ready 
 
 harry sat up suddenly wide awake 
 
 are you sure 
 
 positive said hermione shifting scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of if going to do it i say it should be tonight 
 
 at that moment hedwig swooped into the room carrying a very small package in her beak 
 
 hello said harry happily as she landed on his bed are you speaking to me again 
 
 she nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him which turned out to be from the dursleys they had sent harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether be able to stay at hogwarts for the summer vacation too 
 
 the rest of christmas presents were far more satisfactory hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge which harry decided to soften by the fire before eating ron had given him a book called flying with the cannons a book of interesting facts about his favorite quidditch team and hermione had bought him a luxurious quill harry opened the last present to find a new sweater from mrs weasley and a large plum cake he read her card with a fresh surge of guilt thinking about mr car which been seen since its crash with the whomping willow and the bout of he and ron were planning next 
 
 no one not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion later could fail to enjoy christmas dinner at hogwarts 
 
 the great hall looked magnificent not only were there a dozen christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling but enchanted snow was falling warm and dry from the ceiling dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed percy who noticed that fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead kept asking them all what they were sniggering at harry even care that draco malfoy was making loud snide remark about his new sweater from the slytherin table with a bit of luck malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few 
 
 harry and ron had barely finished their third helpings of christmas pudding when hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening 
 
 we still need a bit of the people changing into said hermione as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent and obviously be best if you can get something of and malfoys best friends tell them anything and we also need to make sure the real crabbe and goyle burst in on us while interrogating him 
 
 got it all worked out she went on smoothly ignoring and stupefied faces she held up two plump chocolate cakes filled these with a simple sleeping draught all you have to do is make sure crabbe and goyle find them you know how greedy they are bound to eat them once asleep pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet 
 
 harry and ron looked incredulously at each other 
 
 hermione i think 
 
 that could go seriously wrong 
 
 but hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one professor mcgonagall sometimes had 
 
 the potion will be useless without and hair she said sternly you do want to investigate malfoy you 
 
 oh all right all right said harry but what about you whose hair are you ripping out 
 
 already got mine said hermione brightly pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it remember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at the dueling club she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me and gone home for christmas so just have to tell the slytherins decided to come back 
 
 when hermione had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potion again ron turned to harry with a expression 
 
 have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong 
 
 but to and utter amazement stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as hermione had said they lurked in the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for crabbe and goyle who had remained alone at the slytherin table shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters when they spotted crabbe and goyle coming out of the great hall harry and ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door 
 
 how thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to goyle and grabbed them grinning stupidly they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths for a moment both of them chewed greedily looks of triumph on their faces then without the smallest change of expression they both keeled over backward onto the floor 
 
 by far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered forehead and ron pulled out several of hairs they also stole their shoes because their own were far too small for crabbe and feet then still stunned at what they had just done they sprinted up to moaning bathroom 
 
 they could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which hermione was stirring the cauldron pulling their robes up over their faces harry and ron knocked softly on the door 
 
 hermione 
 
 they heard the scrape of the lock and hermione emerged and looking anxious behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling glutinous potion three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat 
 
 did you get them hermione asked breathlessly 
 
 harry showed her hair 
 
 good and i sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry hermione said holding up a small sack need bigger sizes once crabbe and goyle 
 
 the three of them stared into the cauldron close up the potion looked like thick dark mud bubbling sluggishly 
 
 sure done everything right said hermione nervously rereading the splotched page of moste potente potions it looks like the book says it should once drunk it have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves 
 
 now what ron whispered 
 
 we separate it into three glasses and add the hairs 
 
 hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses then her hand trembling she shook millicent hair out of its bottle into the first glass 
 
 the potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly a second later it had turned a sick sort of yellow 
 
 urgh essence of millicent bulstrode said ron eyeing it with loathing bet it tastes disgusting 
 
 add yours then said hermione 
 
 harry dropped hair into the middle glass and ron put into the last one both glasses hissed and frothed turned the khaki color of a booger a dark murky brown 
 
 hang on said harry as ron and hermione reached for their glasses better not all drink them in here once we turn into crabbe and goyle we fit and millicent no pixie 
 
 good thinking said ron unlocking the door take separate stalls 
 
 careful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion harry slipped into the middle stall 
 
 ready he called 
 
 ready came and voices 
 
 one two three 
 
 pinching his nose harry drank the potion down in two large gulps it tasted like overcooked cabbage 
 
 immediately his insides started writhing as though just swallowed live snakes doubled up he wondered whether he was going to be sick then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes next bringing him gasping to all fours came a horrible melting feeling as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax and before his eyes his hands began to grow the fingers thickened the nails broadened the knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small 
 
 as suddenly as it had started everything stopped harry lay facedown on the floor listening to myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet with difficulty he kicked off his shoes and stood up so this was what it felt like being goyle his large hand trembling he pulled off his old robes which were hanging a foot above his ankles pulled on the spare ones and laced up boatlike shoes he reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles low on his forehead then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because goyle obviously need them he took them off and called are you two okay low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth 
 
 yeah came the deep grunt of crabbe from his right 
 
 harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror goyle stared back at him out of dull deepset eyes harry scratched his ear so did goyle 
 
 door opened they stared at each other except that he looked pale and shocked ron was indistinguishable from crabbe from the haircut to the long gorilla arms 
 
 this is unbelievable said ron approaching the mirror and prodding flat nose unbelievable 
 
 better get going said harry loosening the watch that was cutting into thick wrist still got to find out where the slytherin common room is i only hope we can find someone to follow 
 
 ron who had been gazing at harry said you know how bizarre it is to see goyle thinking he banged on door we need to go 
 
 a voice answered him 
 
 i i think going to come after all you go on without me 
 
 hermione we know millicent ugly no going to know you 
 
 no really i think come you two hurry up wasting time 
 
 harry looked at ron bewildered 
 
 that looks more like goyle said ron how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question 
 
 hermione are you okay said harry through the door 
 
 fine fine go on 
 
 harry looked at his watch five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed 
 
 meet you back here all right he said 
 
 harry and ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully checked that the coast was clear and set off 
 
 swing your arms like that harry muttered to ron 
 
 eh 
 
 crabbe holds them sort of stiff 
 
 this 
 
 yeah better 
 
 they went down the marble staircase all they needed now was a slytherin that they could follow to the slytherin common room but there was nobody around 
 
 any ideas muttered harry 
 
 the slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there said ron nodding at the entrance to the dungeons the words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long curly hair emerged from the entrance 
 
 excuse me said ron hurrying up to her forgotten the way to our common room 
 
 i beg your pardon said the girl stiffly our common room a ravenclaw 
 
 she walked away looking suspiciously back at them 
 
 harry and ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as and huge feet hit the floor feeling that this going to be as easy as they had hoped 
 
 the labyrinthine passages were deserted they walked deeper and deeper under the school constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left after a quarter of an hour just when they were getting desperate they heard a sudden movement ahead 
 
 ha said ron excitedly one of them now 
 
 the figure was emerging from a side room as they hurried nearer however their hearts sank it a slytherin it was percy 
 
 you doing down here said ron in surprise 
 
 percy looked affronted 
 
 that he said stiffly is none of your business crabbe it 
 
 wh oh yeah said ron 
 
 well get off to your dormitories said percy sternly not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days 
 
 you are ron pointed out 
 
 i said percy drawing himself up am a prefect about to attack me 
 
 a voice suddenly echoed behind harry and ron draco malfoy was strolling toward them and for the first time in his life harry was pleased to see him 
 
 there you are he drawled looking at them have you two been pigging out in the great hall all this time been looking for you i want to show you something really funny 
 
 malfoy glanced witheringly at percy 
 
 and you doing down here weasley he sneered 
 
 percy looked outraged 
 
 you want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect he said i like your attitude 
 
 malfoy sneered and motioned for harry and ron to follow him harry almost said something apologetic to percy but caught himself just in time he and ron hurried after malfoy who said as they turned into the next passage that peter weasley 
 
 percy ron corrected him automatically 
 
 whatever said malfoy noticed him sneaking around a lot lately and i bet i know what up to he thinks going to catch heir 
 
 he gave a short derisive laugh harry and ron exchanged excited looks 
 
 malfoy paused by a stretch of bare damp stone wall 
 
 the new password again he said to harry 
 
 er said harry 
 
 oh yeah said malfoy not listening and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open malfoy marched through it and harry and ron followed him 
 
 the slytherin common room was a long low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round greenish lamps were hanging on chains a fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them and several slytherins were silhouetted around it in chairs 
 
 wait here said malfoy to harry and ron motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire go and get it my just sent it to me 
 
 wondering what malfoy was going to show them harry and ron sat down doing their best to look at home 
 
 malfoy came back a minute later holding what looked like a newspaper clipping he thrust it under nose 
 
 give you a laugh he said 
 
 harry saw eyes widen in shock he read the clipping quickly gave a very forced laugh and handed it to harry 
 
 it had been clipped out of the daily prophet and it said 
 
 inquiry at the ministry of magic 
 
 arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office was today fined fifty galleons for bewitching a muggle car 
 
 mr lucius malfoy a governor of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year called today for mr resignation weasley has brought the ministry into disrepute mr malfoy told our reporter he is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous muggle protection act should be scrapped immediately 
 
 mr weasley was unavailable for comment although his wife told reporters to clear off or set the family ghoul on them 
 
 well said malfoy impatiently as harry handed the clipping back to him you think funny 
 
 ha ha said harry bleakly 
 
 arthur weasley loves muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them said malfoy scornfully never know the weasleys were the way they behave 
 
 or rather face was contorted with fury 
 
 up with you crabbe snapped malfoy 
 
 stomachache ron grunted 
 
 well go up to the hospital wing and give all those mudbloods a kick from me said malfoy snickering you know surprised the daily prophet reported all these attacks yet he went on thoughtfully i suppose trying to hush it all up be sacked if it stop soon always said old the worst thing ever happened to this place he loves a decent headmaster would let slime like that creevey in 
 
 malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of colin potter can i have your picture potter can i have your autograph can i lick your shoes please potter 
 
 he dropped his hands and looked at harry and ron 
 
 the matter with you two 
 
 far too late harry and ron forced themselves to laugh but malfoy seemed satisfied perhaps crabbe and goyle were always slow on the uptake 
 
 saint potter the said malfoy slowly another one with no proper wizard feeling or he go around with that jumped up granger mudblood and people think heir 
 
 harry and ron waited with bated breath malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him but then i wish i knew who it is said malfoy petulantly i could help them 
 
 jaw dropped so that crabbe looked even more clueless than usual fortunately malfoy notice and harry thinking fast said you must have some idea behind it all 
 
 you know i goyle how many times do i have to tell you snapped malfoy and father tell me anything about the last time the chamber was opened either of course it was fifty years ago so it was before his time but he knows all about it and he says that it was all kept quiet and look suspicious if i know too much about it but i know one thing last time the chamber of secrets was opened a mudblood died so i bet a matter of time before one of killed this time i hope granger he said with relish 
 
 ron was clenching gigantic fists feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if ron punched malfoy harry shot him a warning look and said know if the person who opened the chamber last time was caught 
 
 oh yeah whoever it was was expelled said malfoy probably still in azkaban 
 
 azkaban said harry puzzled 
 
 azkaban the wizard prison goyle said malfoy looking at him in disbelief honestly if you were any slower be going backward 
 
 he shifted restlessly in his chair and said father says to keep my head down and let the heir of slytherin get on with it he says the school needs ridding of all the mudblood filth but not to get mixed up in it of course got a lot on his plate at the moment you know the ministry of magic raided our manor last week 
 
 harry tried to force dull face into a look of concern 
 
 yeah said malfoy luckily they find much got some very valuable dark arts stuff but luckily got our own secret chamber under the floor 
 
 ho said ron 
 
 malfoy looked at him so did harry ron blushed even his hair was turning red his nose was also slowly lengthening their hour was up ron was turning back into himself and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving harry he must be too 
 
 they both jumped to their feet 
 
 medicine for my stomach ron grunted and without further ado they sprinted the length of the slytherin common room hurled themselves at the stone wall and dashed up the passage hoping against hope that malfoy noticed anything harry could feel his feet slipping around in huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where locked crabbe and goyle leaving their shoes outside the closet door they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward moaning bathroom 
 
 well it a complete waste of time ron panted closing the bathroom door behind them i know we still found out doing the attacks but going to write to dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the room 
 
 harry checked his face in the cracked mirror he was back to normal he put his glasses on as ron hammered on the door of stall 
 
 hermione come out got loads to tell you 
 
 go away hermione squeaked 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other 
 
 the matter said ron you must be back to normal by now we are 
 
 but moaning myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door harry had never seen her looking so happy 
 
 ooooooh wait till you see she said awful 
 
 they heard the lock slide back and hermione emerged sobbing her robes pulled up over her head 
 
 up said ron uncertainly have you still got nose or something 
 
 hermione let her robes fall and ron backed into the sink 
 
 her face was covered in black fur her eyes had turned yellow and there were long pointed ears poking through her hair 
 
 it was a hair she howled bulstrode have a cat and the supposed to be used for animal transformations 
 
 said ron 
 
 be teased something dreadful said myrtle happily 
 
 okay hermione said harry quickly take you up to the hospital wing madam pomfrey never asks too many questions 
 
 it took a long time to persuade hermione to leave the bathroom moaning myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw wait till everyone finds out got a tail 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelve the patronuscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry knew that hermione had meant well but that stop him from being angry with her he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he know whether he would ever see it again he was positive that there was nothing wrong with the firebolt now but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of tests 
 
 ron was furious with hermione too as far as he was concerned the of a firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage hermione who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room harry and ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and try to persuade her to come back all in all they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after new year and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy again wood sought harry out on the night before term started 
 
 had a good christmas he said and then without waiting for an answer he sat down lowered his voice and said been doing some thinking over christmas harry after last match you know if the dementors come to the next onei meanwe afford you to well 
 
 wood broke off looking awkward 
 
 working on it said harry quickly professor lupin said train me to ward off the dementors we should be starting this week he said have time after christmas 
 
 ah said wood his expression clearing well in that case i really want to lose you as seeker harry and have you ordered a new broom yet 
 
 no said harry 
 
 what better get a move on you know you ride that shooting star against ravenclaw 
 
 he got a firebolt for christmas said ron 
 
 a firebolt no seriously a a real firebolt 
 
 get excited oliver said harry gloomily i got it anymore it was confiscated and he explained all about how the firebolt was now being checked for jinxes 
 
 jinxed how could it be jinxed 
 
 sirius black harry said wearily supposed to be after me so mcgonagall reckons he might have sent it 
 
 waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his seeker wood said but black have bought a firebolt on the run the whole on the lookout for him how could he just walk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomstick 
 
 i know said harry but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down 
 
 wood went pale 
 
 go and talk to her harry he promised make her see reasona firebolta real firebolt on our team she wants gryffindor to win as much as we make her see sense a firebolt 
 
 
 
 classes started again the next day the last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morning but hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the lizards scampered up and down the crumbling logs the first divination lesson of the new term was much less fun professor trelawney was now teaching them palmistry and she lost no time in informing harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen 
 
 it was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get to after his conversation with wood he wanted to get started on his lessons as soon as possible 
 
 ah yes said lupin when harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class let me seehow about eight on thursday evening the history of magic classroom should be large have to think carefully about how going to do thiswe bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on 
 
 still looks ill he said ron as they walked down the corridor heading to dinner what the matter with him 
 
 there was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them it was hermione who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor repacking her bag which was so full of books it close 
 
 and what are you tutting at us for said ron irritably 
 
 nothing said hermione in a lofty voice heaving her bag back over her shoulder 
 
 yes you were said ron i said i wonder wrong with lupin and you 
 
 well it obvious said hermione with a look of maddening superiority 
 
 if you want to tell us snapped ron 
 
 fine said hermione haughtily and she marched off 
 
 she know said ron staring resentfully after hermione just trying to get us to talk to her again 
 
 
 
 at eight on thursday evening harry left gryffindor tower for the history of magic classroom it was dark and empty when he arrived but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when professor lupin turned up carrying a large packing case which he heaved onto professor desk 
 
 that said harry 
 
 another boggart said lupin stripping off his cloak been combing the castle ever since tuesday and very luckily i found this one lurking inside mr filing cabinet the nearest get to a real dementor the boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you so be able to practice on him i can store him in my office when not using him a cupboard under my desk like 
 
 okay said harry trying to sound as though he apprehensive at all and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor 
 
 so professor lupin had taken out his own wand and indicated that harry should do the same the spell i am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic harry well beyond ordinary wizarding level it is called the patronus charm 
 
 how does it work said harry nervously 
 
 well when it works correctly it conjures up a patronus said lupin which is a kind of a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor 
 
 harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a figure holding a large club professor lupin continued the patronus is a kind of positive force a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon hope happiness the desire to survive but it cannot feel despair as real humans can so the dementors hurt it but i must warn you harry that the charm might be too advanced for you many qualified wizards have difficulty with it 
 
 what does a patronus look like said harry curiously 
 
 each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it 
 
 and how do you conjure it 
 
 with an incantation which will work only if you are concentrating with all your might on a single very happy memory 
 
 harry cast his mind about for a happy memory certainly nothing that had happened to him at the dursleys was going to do finally he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick 
 
 right he said trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful soaring sensation of his stomach 
 
 the incantation is this lupin cleared his throat expecto patronum 
 
 expecto patronum harry repeated under his breath expecto patronum 
 
 concentrating hard on your happy memory 
 
 oh yeah said harry quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride expecto patrono no patronum sorry expecto patronum expecto patronum 
 
 something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand it looked like a wisp of silvery gas 
 
 did you see that said harry excitedly something happened 
 
 very good said lupin smiling right then ready to try it on a dementor 
 
 yes harry said gripping his wand very tightly and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom he tried to keep his mind on flying but something else kept intrudingany second now he might hear his mother againbut he think that or he would hear her again and he want toor did he 
 
 lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled 
 
 a dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward harry one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak the lamps around the classroom flickered and went out the dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward harry drawing a deep rattling breath a wave of piercing cold broke over him 
 
 expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto 
 
 but the classroom and the dementor were dissolvingharry was falling again through thick white fog and his voice was louder than ever echoing inside his head not harry not harry please do anything 
 
 stand aside stand aside girl 
 
 harry 
 
 harry jerked back to life he was lying flat on his back on the floor the classroom lamps were alight again he have to ask what had happened 
 
 sorry he muttered sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses 
 
 are you all right said lupin 
 
 yes harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it 
 
 here lupin handed him a chocolate frog eat this before we try again i expect you to do it your first time in fact i would have been astounded if you had 
 
 getting worse harry muttered biting off the head i could hear her louder that time and him voldemort 
 
 lupin looked paler than usual 
 
 harry if you want to continue i will more than understand 
 
 i do said harry fiercely stuffing the rest of the chocolate frog into his mouth got to what if the dementors turn up at our match against ravenclaw i afford to fall off again if we lose this game lost the quidditch cup 
 
 all right then said lupin you might want to select another memory a happy memory i mean to concentrate onthat one seem to have been strong enough 
 
 harry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won the house championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy he gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom 
 
 ready said lupin gripping the box lid 
 
 ready said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about gryffindor winning and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened 
 
 go said lupin pulling off the lid the room went icily cold and dark once more the dementor glided forward drawing its breath one rotting hand was extending toward harry 
 
 expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto pat 
 
 white fog obscured his sensesbig blurred shapes were moving around himthen came a new voice a voice shouting panicking 
 
 lily take harry and go him go run hold him off 
 
 the sounds of someone stumbling from a room a door bursting open a cackle of high pitched laughter 
 
 harry harrywake up 
 
 lupin was tapping harry hard on the face this time it was a minute before harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor 
 
 i heard my dad harry mumbled the first time ever heard him he tried to take on voldemort himself to give my mum time to run for it 
 
 harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat he bent his face as low as possible wiping them off on his robes pretending to do up his shoelace so that lupin see 
 
 you heard james said lupin in a strange voice 
 
 yeah face dry harry looked up why you know my dad did you 
 
 i i did as a matter of fact said lupin we were friends at hogwarts listen harry perhaps we should leave it here for tonight this charm is ridiculously advancedi have suggested putting you through this 
 
 no said harry he got up again have one more go not thinking of happy enough things what it ishang on 
 
 he racked his brains a really really happy memoryone that he could turn into a good strong patronus 
 
 the moment when first found out he was a wizard and would be leaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that a happy memory he know what wasconcentrating very hard on how he had felt when realized be leaving privet drive harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more 
 
 ready said lupin who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment concentrating hard all right go 
 
 he pulled off the lid of the case for the third time and the dementor rose out of it the room fell cold and dark 
 
 expecto patronum harry bellowed expecto patronum expecto patronum 
 
 the screaming inside head had started again except this time it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio softer and louder and softer againand he could still see the dementorit had haltedand then a huge silver shadow came bursting out of the end of wand to hover between him and the dementor and though legs felt like water he was still on his feet though for how much longer he sure 
 
 riddikulus roared lupin springing forward 
 
 there was a loud crack and cloudy patronus vanished along with the dementor he sank into a chair feeling as exhausted as if just run a mile and felt his legs shaking out of the corner of his eye he saw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand it had turned into a silvery orb again 
 
 excellent lupin said striding over to where harry sat excellent harry that was definitely a start 
 
 can we have another go just one more go 
 
 not now said lupin firmly had enough for one night here 
 
 he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes best chocolate 
 
 eat the lot or madam pomfrey will be after my blood same time next week 
 
 okay said harry he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor a thought had just occurred to him 
 
 professor lupin he said if you knew my dad you known sirius black as well 
 
 lupin turned very quickly 
 
 what gives you that idea he said sharply 
 
 nothing i mean i just knew they were friends at hogwarts too 
 
 face relaxed 
 
 yes i knew him he said shortly or i thought i did better be off harry getting late 
 
 harry left the classroom walking along the corridor and around a corner then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate wishing he mentioned black as lupin was obviously not keen on the subject then thoughts wandered back to his mother and father 
 
 he felt drained and strangely empty even though he was so full of chocolate terrible though it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child but never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again 
 
 dead he told himself sternly dead and listening to echoes of them bring them back better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cup 
 
 he stood up crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to gryffindor tower 
 
 
 
 ravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term slytherin won though narrowly according to wood this was good news for gryffindor who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too he therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week this meant that with classes which in themselves were more draining than six quidditch practices harry had just one night a week to do all his homework even so he was not showing the strain nearly as much as hermione whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her every night without fail hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room several tables spread with books arithmancy charts rune dictionaries diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects and file upon file of extensive notes she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted 
 
 she doing it ron muttered to harry one evening as harry sat finishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape harry looked up hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books 
 
 doing what 
 
 getting to all her classes ron said i heard her talking to professor vector that arithmancy witch this morning they were going on about lesson but hermione been there because she was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told me never missed a muggle studies class but half of them are at the same time as divination and never missed one of them either 
 
 harry have time to fathom the mystery of impossible schedule at the moment he really needed to get on with essay two seconds later however he was interrupted again this time by wood 
 
 bad news harry just been to see professor mcgonagall about the firebolt she er got a bit shirty with me told me got my priorities wrong seemed to think i cared more about winning the cup than i do about you staying alive just because i told her i care if it threw you off as long as you caught the snitch first wood shook his head in disbelief honestly the way she was yelling at think said something terrible then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it he screwed up his face and imitated professor severe voice as long as necessary woodi reckon time you ordered a new broom harry an order form at the back of which broomstickyou could get a nimbus two thousand and one like got 
 
 not buying anything malfoy thinks is good said harry flatly 
 
 
 
 january faded imperceptibly into february with no change in the bitterly cold weather the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer but harry still ordered a new broom he was now asking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after every transfiguration lesson ron standing hopefully at his shoulder hermione rushing past with her face averted 
 
 no potter you have it back yet professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened before even opened his mouth checked for most of the usual curses but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex i shall tell you once finished checking it now please stop badgering me 
 
 to make matters even worse lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped several sessions on he was able to produce an indistinct silvery shadow every time the approached him but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away all it did was hover like a semitransparent cloud draining harry of energy as he fought to keep it there harry felt angry with himself guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices again 
 
 expecting too much of yourself said professor lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice for a wizard even an indistinct patronus is a huge achievement you passing out anymore are you 
 
 i thought a patronus would charge the dementors down or something said harry dispiritedly make them disappear 
 
 the true patronus does do that said lupin but achieved a great deal in a very short space of time if the dementors put in an appearance at your next quidditch match you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground 
 
 you said harder if there are loads of them said harry 
 
 i have complete confidence in you said lupin smiling here earned a drink something from the three broomsticks you have tried it before 
 
 he pulled two bottles out of his briefcase 
 
 butterbeer said harry without thinking yeah i like that stuff 
 
 lupin raised an eyebrow 
 
 oh ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade harry lied quickly 
 
 i see said lupin though he still looked slightly suspicious well drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that supposed to take sides as a teacher he added hastily 
 
 they drank the butterbeer in silence until harry voiced something been wondering for a while 
 
 under a hood 
 
 professor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully 
 
 hmmm well the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us you see the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon 
 
 that 
 
 they call it the kiss said lupin with a slightly twisted smile what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly i suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and and suck out his soul 
 
 harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer 
 
 what they kill 
 
 oh no said lupin much worse than that you can exist without your soul you know as long as your brain and heart are still working but have no sense of self anymore no memory noanything no chance at all of recovery just exist as an empty shell and your soul is gone foreverlost 
 
 lupin drank a little more butterbeer then said the fate that awaits sirius black it was in the daily prophet this morning the ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him 
 
 harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth but then he thought of black 
 
 he deserves it he said suddenly 
 
 you think so said lupin lightly do you really think anyone deserves that 
 
 yes said harry defiantly forfor some things 
 
 he would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation overheard about black in the three broomsticks about black betraying his mother and father but it would have involved revealing that gone to hogsmeade without permission and he knew lupin be very impressed by that so he finished his butterbeer thanked lupin and left the history of magic classroom 
 
 harry half wished that he asked what was under a hood the answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairs 
 
 do watch where going potter 
 
 sorry professor 
 
 just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room well here it is done everything we could think of and there seem to be anything wrong with it at all got a very good friend somewhere potter 
 
 jaw dropped she was holding out his firebolt and it looked as magnificent as ever 
 
 i can have it back harry said weakly seriously 
 
 seriously said professor mcgonagall and she was actually smiling i daresay need to get the feel of it before match you and potter do try and win you or be out of the running for the eighth year in a row as professor snape was kind enough to remind me only last night 
 
 speechless harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower as he turned a corner he saw ron dashing toward him grinning from ear to ear 
 
 she gave it to you excellent listen can i still have a go on it tomorrow 
 
 yeahanything said harry his heart lighter than it had been in a month you know what we should make up with hermioneshe was only trying to help 
 
 yeah all right said ron in the common room now working for a change 
 
 they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom pleading with sir cadogan who seemed to be refusing him entrance 
 
 i wrote them down neville was saying tearfully but i dropped them somewhere 
 
 a likely tale roared sir cadogan then spotting harry and ron good even my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons he is trying to force entry to the chambers within 
 
 oh shut up said ron as he and harry drew level with neville 
 
 lost the passwords neville told them miserably i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week because he keeps changing them and now i know what done with them 
 
 oddsbodkins said harry to sir cadogan who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room there was a sudden excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his firebolt 
 
 you get it harry 
 
 will you let me have a go 
 
 have you ridden it yet harry 
 
 have no chance all on cleansweep sevens 
 
 can i just hold it harry 
 
 after ten minutes or so during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione the only person who rushed over to them bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes harry and ron approached her table and at last she looked up 
 
 i got it back said harry grinning at her and holding up the firebolt 
 
 see hermione there anything wrong with it said ron 
 
 well there might have been said hermione i mean at least you know now that safe 
 
 yeah i suppose so said harry better put it upstairs

 he took the firebolt and holding it as if it were made of glass carried it away up the boys staircase 
 
 can i sit down then harry asked hermione 
 
 i suppose so said hermione moving a great stack of parchment off a chair 
 
 harry looked around at the cluttered table at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening at the even longer muggle studies essay explain why muggles need electricity and at the rune translation hermione was now poring over 
 
 how are you getting through all this stuff harry asked her 
 
 oh well you know working hard said hermione harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupin 
 
 why you just drop a couple of subjects harry asked watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary 
 
 i do that said hermione looking scandalized 
 
 arithmancy looks terrible said harry picking up a very number chart 
 
 oh no wonderful said hermione earnestly my favorite subject 
 
 but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy harry never found out at that precise moment a strangled yell echoed down the boys staircase the whole common room fell silent staring petrified at the entrance then came hurried footsteps growing louder and louder and then ron came leaping into view dragging with him a bedsheet 
 
 look he bellowed striding over to table look he yelled shaking the sheets in her face 
 
 ron what 
 
 scabbers look scabbers 
 
 hermione was leaning away from ron looking utterly bewildered harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding there was something red on it something that looked horribly like 
 
 blood ron yelled into the stunned silence gone and you know what was on the floor 
 
 n no said hermione in a trembling voice 
 
 ron threw something down onto rune translation hermione and harry leaned forward lying on top of the weird spiky shapes were several long ginger cat hairs

 harry knew that hermione had meant well but that stop him from being angry with her he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he know whether he would ever see it again he was positive that there was nothing wrong with the firebolt now but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of tests 
 
 ron was furious with hermione too as far as he was concerned the of a firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage hermione who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room harry and ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and try to persuade her to come back all in all they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after new year and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy again wood sought harry out on the night before term started 
 
 had a good christmas he said and then without waiting for an answer he sat down lowered his voice and said been doing some thinking over christmas harry after last match you know if the dementors come to the next onei meanwe afford you to well 
 
 wood broke off looking awkward 
 
 working on it said harry quickly professor lupin said train me to ward off the dementors we should be starting this week he said have time after christmas 
 
 ah said wood his expression clearing well in that case i really want to lose you as seeker harry and have you ordered a new broom yet 
 
 no said harry 
 
 what better get a move on you know you ride that shooting star against ravenclaw 
 
 he got a firebolt for christmas said ron 
 
 a firebolt no seriously a a real firebolt 
 
 get excited oliver said harry gloomily i got it anymore it was confiscated and he explained all about how the firebolt was now being checked for jinxes 
 
 jinxed how could it be jinxed 
 
 sirius black harry said wearily supposed to be after me so mcgonagall reckons he might have sent it 
 
 waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his seeker wood said but black have bought a firebolt on the run the whole on the lookout for him how could he just walk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomstick 
 
 i know said harry but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down 
 
 wood went pale 
 
 go and talk to her harry he promised make her see reasona firebolta real firebolt on our team she wants gryffindor to win as much as we make her see sense a firebolt 
 
 
 
 classes started again the next day the last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morning but hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the lizards scampered up and down the crumbling logs the first divination lesson of the new term was much less fun professor trelawney was now teaching them palmistry and she lost no time in informing harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen 
 
 it was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get to after his conversation with wood he wanted to get started on his lessons as soon as possible 
 
 ah yes said lupin when harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class let me seehow about eight on thursday evening the history of magic classroom should be large have to think carefully about how going to do thiswe bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on 
 
 still looks ill he said ron as they walked down the corridor heading to dinner what the matter with him 
 
 there was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them it was hermione who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor repacking her bag which was so full of books it close 
 
 and what are you tutting at us for said ron irritably 
 
 nothing said hermione in a lofty voice heaving her bag back over her shoulder 
 
 yes you were said ron i said i wonder wrong with lupin and you 
 
 well it obvious said hermione with a look of maddening superiority 
 
 if you want to tell us snapped ron 
 
 fine said hermione haughtily and she marched off 
 
 she know said ron staring resentfully after hermione just trying to get us to talk to her again 
 
 
 
 at eight on thursday evening harry left gryffindor tower for the history of magic classroom it was dark and empty when he arrived but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when professor lupin turned up carrying a large packing case which he heaved onto professor desk 
 
 that said harry 
 
 another boggart said lupin stripping off his cloak been combing the castle ever since tuesday and very luckily i found this one lurking inside mr filing cabinet the nearest get to a real dementor the boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you so be able to practice on him i can store him in my office when not using him a cupboard under my desk like 
 
 okay said harry trying to sound as though he apprehensive at all and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor 
 
 so professor lupin had taken out his own wand and indicated that harry should do the same the spell i am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic harry well beyond ordinary wizarding level it is called the patronus charm 
 
 how does it work said harry nervously 
 
 well when it works correctly it conjures up a patronus said lupin which is a kind of a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor 
 
 harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a figure holding a large club professor lupin continued the patronus is a kind of positive force a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon hope happiness the desire to survive but it cannot feel despair as real humans can so the dementors hurt it but i must warn you harry that the charm might be too advanced for you many qualified wizards have difficulty with it 
 
 what does a patronus look like said harry curiously 
 
 each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it 
 
 and how do you conjure it 
 
 with an incantation which will work only if you are concentrating with all your might on a single very happy memory 
 
 harry cast his mind about for a happy memory certainly nothing that had happened to him at the dursleys was going to do finally he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick 
 
 right he said trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful soaring sensation of his stomach 
 
 the incantation is this lupin cleared his throat expecto patronum 
 
 expecto patronum harry repeated under his breath expecto patronum 
 
 concentrating hard on your happy memory 
 
 oh yeah said harry quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride expecto patrono no patronum sorry expecto patronum expecto patronum 
 
 something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand it looked like a wisp of silvery gas 
 
 did you see that said harry excitedly something happened 
 
 very good said lupin smiling right then ready to try it on a dementor 
 
 yes harry said gripping his wand very tightly and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom he tried to keep his mind on flying but something else kept intrudingany second now he might hear his mother againbut he think that or he would hear her again and he want toor did he 
 
 lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled 
 
 a dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward harry one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak the lamps around the classroom flickered and went out the dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward harry drawing a deep rattling breath a wave of piercing cold broke over him 
 
 expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto 
 
 but the classroom and the dementor were dissolvingharry was falling again through thick white fog and his voice was louder than ever echoing inside his head not harry not harry please do anything 
 
 stand aside stand aside girl 
 
 harry 
 
 harry jerked back to life he was lying flat on his back on the floor the classroom lamps were alight again he have to ask what had happened 
 
 sorry he muttered sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses 
 
 are you all right said lupin 
 
 yes harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it 
 
 here lupin handed him a chocolate frog eat this before we try again i expect you to do it your first time in fact i would have been astounded if you had 
 
 getting worse harry muttered biting off the head i could hear her louder that time and him voldemort 
 
 lupin looked paler than usual 
 
 harry if you want to continue i will more than understand 
 
 i do said harry fiercely stuffing the rest of the chocolate frog into his mouth got to what if the dementors turn up at our match against ravenclaw i afford to fall off again if we lose this game lost the quidditch cup 
 
 all right then said lupin you might want to select another memory a happy memory i mean to concentrate onthat one seem to have been strong enough 
 
 harry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won the house championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy he gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom 
 
 ready said lupin gripping the box lid 
 
 ready said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about gryffindor winning and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened 
 
 go said lupin pulling off the lid the room went icily cold and dark once more the dementor glided forward drawing its breath one rotting hand was extending toward harry 
 
 expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto pat 
 
 white fog obscured his sensesbig blurred shapes were moving around himthen came a new voice a voice shouting panicking 
 
 lily take harry and go him go run hold him off 
 
 the sounds of someone stumbling from a room a door bursting open a cackle of high pitched laughter 
 
 harry harrywake up 
 
 lupin was tapping harry hard on the face this time it was a minute before harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor 
 
 i heard my dad harry mumbled the first time ever heard him he tried to take on voldemort himself to give my mum time to run for it 
 
 harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat he bent his face as low as possible wiping them off on his robes pretending to do up his shoelace so that lupin see 
 
 you heard james said lupin in a strange voice 
 
 yeah face dry harry looked up why you know my dad did you 
 
 i i did as a matter of fact said lupin we were friends at hogwarts listen harry perhaps we should leave it here for tonight this charm is ridiculously advancedi have suggested putting you through this 
 
 no said harry he got up again have one more go not thinking of happy enough things what it ishang on 
 
 he racked his brains a really really happy memoryone that he could turn into a good strong patronus 
 
 the moment when first found out he was a wizard and would be leaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that a happy memory he know what wasconcentrating very hard on how he had felt when realized be leaving privet drive harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more 
 
 ready said lupin who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment concentrating hard all right go 
 
 he pulled off the lid of the case for the third time and the dementor rose out of it the room fell cold and dark 
 
 expecto patronum harry bellowed expecto patronum expecto patronum 
 
 the screaming inside head had started again except this time it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio softer and louder and softer againand he could still see the dementorit had haltedand then a huge silver shadow came bursting out of the end of wand to hover between him and the dementor and though legs felt like water he was still on his feet though for how much longer he sure 
 
 riddikulus roared lupin springing forward 
 
 there was a loud crack and cloudy patronus vanished along with the dementor he sank into a chair feeling as exhausted as if just run a mile and felt his legs shaking out of the corner of his eye he saw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand it had turned into a silvery orb again 
 
 excellent lupin said striding over to where harry sat excellent harry that was definitely a start 
 
 can we have another go just one more go 
 
 not now said lupin firmly had enough for one night here 
 
 he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes best chocolate 
 
 eat the lot or madam pomfrey will be after my blood same time next week 
 
 okay said harry he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor a thought had just occurred to him 
 
 professor lupin he said if you knew my dad you known sirius black as well 
 
 lupin turned very quickly 
 
 what gives you that idea he said sharply 
 
 nothing i mean i just knew they were friends at hogwarts too 
 
 face relaxed 
 
 yes i knew him he said shortly or i thought i did better be off harry getting late 
 
 harry left the classroom walking along the corridor and around a corner then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate wishing he mentioned black as lupin was obviously not keen on the subject then thoughts wandered back to his mother and father 
 
 he felt drained and strangely empty even though he was so full of chocolate terrible though it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child but never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again 
 
 dead he told himself sternly dead and listening to echoes of them bring them back better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cup 
 
 he stood up crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to gryffindor tower 
 
 
 
 ravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term slytherin won though narrowly according to wood this was good news for gryffindor who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too he therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week this meant that with classes which in themselves were more draining than six quidditch practices harry had just one night a week to do all his homework even so he was not showing the strain nearly as much as hermione whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her every night without fail hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room several tables spread with books arithmancy charts rune dictionaries diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects and file upon file of extensive notes she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted 
 
 she doing it ron muttered to harry one evening as harry sat finishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape harry looked up hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books 
 
 doing what 
 
 getting to all her classes ron said i heard her talking to professor vector that arithmancy witch this morning they were going on about lesson but hermione been there because she was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told me never missed a muggle studies class but half of them are at the same time as divination and never missed one of them either 
 
 harry have time to fathom the mystery of impossible schedule at the moment he really needed to get on with essay two seconds later however he was interrupted again this time by wood 
 
 bad news harry just been to see professor mcgonagall about the firebolt she er got a bit shirty with me told me got my priorities wrong seemed to think i cared more about winning the cup than i do about you staying alive just because i told her i care if it threw you off as long as you caught the snitch first wood shook his head in disbelief honestly the way she was yelling at think said something terrible then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it he screwed up his face and imitated professor severe voice as long as necessary woodi reckon time you ordered a new broom harry an order form at the back of which broomstickyou could get a nimbus two thousand and one like got 
 
 not buying anything malfoy thinks is good said harry flatly 
 
 
 
 january faded imperceptibly into february with no change in the bitterly cold weather the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer but harry still ordered a new broom he was now asking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after every transfiguration lesson ron standing hopefully at his shoulder hermione rushing past with her face averted 
 
 no potter you have it back yet professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened before even opened his mouth checked for most of the usual curses but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex i shall tell you once finished checking it now please stop badgering me 
 
 to make matters even worse lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped several sessions on he was able to produce an indistinct silvery shadow every time the approached him but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away all it did was hover like a semitransparent cloud draining harry of energy as he fought to keep it there harry felt angry with himself guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices again 
 
 expecting too much of yourself said professor lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice for a wizard even an indistinct patronus is a huge achievement you passing out anymore are you 
 
 i thought a patronus would charge the dementors down or something said harry dispiritedly make them disappear 
 
 the true patronus does do that said lupin but achieved a great deal in a very short space of time if the dementors put in an appearance at your next quidditch match you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground 
 
 you said harder if there are loads of them said harry 
 
 i have complete confidence in you said lupin smiling here earned a drink something from the three broomsticks you have tried it before 
 
 he pulled two bottles out of his briefcase 
 
 butterbeer said harry without thinking yeah i like that stuff 
 
 lupin raised an eyebrow 
 
 oh ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade harry lied quickly 
 
 i see said lupin though he still looked slightly suspicious well drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that supposed to take sides as a teacher he added hastily 
 
 they drank the butterbeer in silence until harry voiced something been wondering for a while 
 
 under a hood 
 
 professor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully 
 
 hmmm well the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us you see the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon 
 
 that 
 
 they call it the kiss said lupin with a slightly twisted smile what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly i suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and and suck out his soul 
 
 harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer 
 
 what they kill 
 
 oh no said lupin much worse than that you can exist without your soul you know as long as your brain and heart are still working but have no sense of self anymore no memory noanything no chance at all of recovery just exist as an empty shell and your soul is gone foreverlost 
 
 lupin drank a little more butterbeer then said the fate that awaits sirius black it was in the daily prophet this morning the ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him 
 
 harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth but then he thought of black 
 
 he deserves it he said suddenly 
 
 you think so said lupin lightly do you really think anyone deserves that 
 
 yes said harry defiantly forfor some things 
 
 he would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation overheard about black in the three broomsticks about black betraying his mother and father but it would have involved revealing that gone to hogsmeade without permission and he knew lupin be very impressed by that so he finished his butterbeer thanked lupin and left the history of magic classroom 
 
 harry half wished that he asked what was under a hood the answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairs 
 
 do watch where going potter 
 
 sorry professor 
 
 just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room well here it is done everything we could think of and there seem to be anything wrong with it at all got a very good friend somewhere potter 
 
 jaw dropped she was holding out his firebolt and it looked as magnificent as ever 
 
 i can have it back harry said weakly seriously 
 
 seriously said professor mcgonagall and she was actually smiling i daresay need to get the feel of it before match you and potter do try and win you or be out of the running for the eighth year in a row as professor snape was kind enough to remind me only last night 
 
 speechless harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower as he turned a corner he saw ron dashing toward him grinning from ear to ear 
 
 she gave it to you excellent listen can i still have a go on it tomorrow 
 
 yeahanything said harry his heart lighter than it had been in a month you know what we should make up with hermioneshe was only trying to help 
 
 yeah all right said ron in the common room now working for a change 
 
 they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom pleading with sir cadogan who seemed to be refusing him entrance 
 
 i wrote them down neville was saying tearfully but i dropped them somewhere 
 
 a likely tale roared sir cadogan then spotting harry and ron good even my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons he is trying to force entry to the chambers within 
 
 oh shut up said ron as he and harry drew level with neville 
 
 lost the passwords neville told them miserably i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week because he keeps changing them and now i know what done with them 
 
 oddsbodkins said harry to sir cadogan who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room there was a sudden excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his firebolt 
 
 you get it harry 
 
 will you let me have a go 
 
 have you ridden it yet harry 
 
 have no chance all on cleansweep sevens 
 
 can i just hold it harry 
 
 after ten minutes or so during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione the only person who rushed over to them bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes harry and ron approached her table and at last she looked up 
 
 i got it back said harry grinning at her and holding up the firebolt 
 
 see hermione there anything wrong with it said ron 
 
 well there might have been said hermione i mean at least you know now that safe 
 
 yeah i suppose so said harry better put it upstairs 
 
 take it said ron eagerly got to give scabbers his rat tonic 
 
 he took the firebolt and holding it as if it were made of glass carried it away up the boys staircase 
 
 can i sit down then harry asked hermione 
 
 i suppose so said hermione moving a great stack of parchment off a chair 
 
 harry looked around at the cluttered table at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening at the even longer muggle studies essay explain why muggles need electricity and at the rune translation hermione was now poring over 
 
 how are you getting through all this stuff harry asked her 
 
 oh well you know working hard said hermione harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupin 
 
 why you just drop a couple of subjects harry asked watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary 
 
 i do that said hermione looking scandalized 
 
 arithmancy looks terrible said harry picking up a very number chart 
 
 oh no wonderful said hermione earnestly my favorite subject 
 
 but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy harry never found out at that precise moment a strangled yell echoed down the boys staircase the whole common room fell silent staring petrified at the entrance then came hurried footsteps growing louder and louder and then ron came leaping into view dragging with him a bedsheet 
 
 look he bellowed striding over to table look he yelled shaking the sheets in her face

 scabbers look scabbers 
 
 hermione was leaning away from ron looking utterly bewildered harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding there was something red on it something that looked horribly like

 through the gates flanked with statues of winged boars and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale leaning against the window harry could see hogwarts coming nearer its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps people who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle harry ron hermione and neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous entrance hall with its magnificent marble staircase 
 
 blimey said ron shaking his head and sending water everywhere if that keeps up the going to overflow soak arrgh 
 
 a large red balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto head and exploded drenched and sputtering ron staggered sideways into harry just as a second water bomb dropped narrowly missing hermione it burst at feet sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks people all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire harry looked up and saw floating twenty feet above them peeves the poltergeist a little man in a hat and orange bow tie his wide malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again 
 
 peeves yelled an angry voice peeves come down here at once 
 
 professor mcgonagall deputy headmistress and head of gryffindor house had come dashing out of the great hall she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling 
 
 ouch sorry miss granger 
 
 all right professor hermione gasped massaging her throat 
 
 peeves get down here now barked professor mcgonagall straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her spectacles 
 
 not doing nothing cackled peeves lobbing a water bomb at several girls who screamed and dived into the great hall already wet they little squirts wheeeeeeeeee and he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived 
 
 i shall call the headmaster shouted professor mcgonagall warning you peeves 
 
 peeves stuck out his tongue threw the last of his water bombs into the air and zoomed off up the marble staircase cackling insanely 
 
 well move along then said professor mcgonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd into the great hall come on 
 
 harry ron and hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face 
 
 the great hall looked its usual splendid self decorated for the feast golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles floating over the tables in midair the four long house tables were packed with chattering students at the top of the hall the staff sat along one side of a fifth table facing their pupils it was much warmer in here harry ron and hermione walked past the slytherins the ravenclaws and the hufflepuffs and sat down with the rest of the gryffindors at the far side of the hall next to nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost pearly white and semitransparent nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet but with a particularly large ruff which served the dual purpose of looking and insuring that his head wobble too much on his partially severed neck 
 
 good evening he said beaming at them 
 
 says who said harry taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water hope they hurry up with the sorting starving 
 
 the sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year but by an unlucky combination of circumstances harry been present at one since his own he was quite looking forward to it just then a highly excited breathless voice called down the table 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a third year to whom harry was something of a hero 
 
 hi colin said harry warily 
 
 harry guess what guess what harry my starting my brother dennis 
 
 er good said harry 
 
 really excited said colin practically bouncing up and down in his seat i just hope in gryffindor keep your fingers crossed eh harry 
 
 er yeah all right said harry he turned back to hermione ron and nearly headless nick brothers and sisters usually go in the same houses they he said he was judging by the weasleys all seven of whom had been put into gryffindor 
 
 oh no not necessarily said hermione parvati in ravenclaw and identical think be together you 
 
 harry looked up at the staff table there seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual hagrid of course was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years professor mcgonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor but there was another empty chair too and harry think who else was missing 
 
 the new defense against the dark arts teacher said hermione who was also looking up at the teachers 
 
 they had never yet had a defense against the dark arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms favorite by far had been professor lupin who had resigned last year he looked up and down the staff table there was definitely no new face there 
 
 maybe they get anyone said hermione looking anxious 
 
 harry scanned the table more carefully tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside professor sprout the herbology teacher whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair she was talking to professor sinistra of the astronomy department on professor other side was the potions master snape least favorite person at hogwarts loathing of snape was matched only by hatred of him a hatred which had if possible intensified last year when harry had helped sirius escape right under overlarge nose snape and sirius had been enemies since their own school days 
 
 on other side was an empty seat which harry guessed was professor next to it and in the very center of the table sat professor dumbledore the headmaster his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons the tips of long thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them staring up at the ceiling through his spectacles as though lost in thought harry glanced up at the ceiling too it was enchanted to look like the sky outside and he had never seen it look this stormy black and purple clouds were swirling across it and as another thunderclap sounded outside a fork of lightning flashed across it 
 
 oh hurry up ron moaned beside harry i could eat a hippogriff 
 
 the words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the great hall opened and silence fell professor mcgonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the hall if harry ron and hermione were wet it was nothing to how these first years looked they appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed all of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school all of them except the smallest of the lot a boy with mousy hair who was wrapped in what harry recognized as moleskin overcoat the coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent his small face protruded from over the collar looking almost painfully excited when he had lined up with his peers he caught colin eye gave a double and mouthed i fell in the lake he looked positively delighted about it 
 
 professor mcgonagall now placed a stool on the ground before the first years and on top of it an extremely old dirty patched hat the first years stared at it so did everyone else for a moment there was silence then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat broke into song 
 
 a thousand years or more ago 
 when i was newly lived four wizards of renown 
 whose names are still well known 
 bold gryffindor from wild moor 
 fair ravenclaw from glen 
 sweet hufflepuff from valley broad 
 shrewd slytherin from fin 
 they shared a wish a hope a dream 
 they hatched a daring plan 
 to educate young sorcerers 
 thus hogwarts school began 
 now each of these four founders 
 formed their own house for each 
 did value different virtues 
 in the ones they had to teach 
 by gryffindor the bravest were 
 prized far beyond the rest 
 for ravenclaw the cleverest 
 would always be the best 
 for hufflepuff hard workers were 
 most worthy of admission 
 and slytherin 
 loved those of great ambition 
 while still alive they did divide 
 their favorites from the throng 
 yet how to pick the worthy ones 
 when they were dead and gone 
 twas gryffindor who found the way 
 he whipped me off his head 
 the founders put some brains in me 
 so i could choose instead 
 now slip me snug about your ears 
 never yet been wrong 
 have a look inside your mind 
 and tell where you belong 
 
 the great hall rang with applause as the sorting hat finished 
 
 not the song it sang when it sorted us said harry clapping along with everyone else 
 
 sings a different one every year said ron got to be a pretty boring life it being a hat i suppose it spends all year making up the next one 
 
 professor mcgonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment 
 
 when i call out your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool she told the first years when the hat announces your house you will go and sit at the appropriate table 
 
 ackerley stewart 
 
 a boy walked forward visibly trembling from head to foot picked up the sorting hat put it on and sat down on the stool 
 
 ravenclaw shouted the hat 
 
 stewart ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the ravenclaw table where everyone was applauding him harry caught a glimpse of cho the ravenclaw seeker cheering stewart ackerley as he sat down for a fleeting second harry had a strange desire to join the ravenclaw table too 
 
 baddock malcolm 
 
 slytherin 
 
 the table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers harry could see malfoy clapping as baddock joined the slytherins harry wondered whether baddock knew that slytherin house had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other fred and george hissed malcolm baddock as he sat down 
 
 branstone eleanor 
 
 hufflepuff 
 
 cauldwell owen 
 
 hufflepuff 
 
 creevey dennis 
 
 tiny dennis creevey staggered forward tripping over moleskin just as hagrid himself sidled into the hall through a door behind the teachers table about twice as tall as a normal man and at least three times as broad hagrid with his long wild tangled black hair and beard looked slightly alarming a misleading impression for harry ron and hermione knew hagrid to possess a very kind nature he winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched dennis creevey putting on the sorting hat the rip at the brim opened wide 
 
 gryffindor the hat shouted 
 
 hagrid clapped along with the gryffindors as dennis creevey beaming widely took off the hat placed it back on the stool and hurried over to join his brother 
 
 colin i fell in he said shrilly throwing himself into an empty seat it was brilliant and something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat 
 
 cool said colin just as excitedly it was probably the giant squid dennis 
 
 wow said dennis as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a lake and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster 
 
 dennis dennis see that boy down there the one with the black hair and glasses see him know who he is dennis 
 
 harry looked away staring very hard at the sorting hat now sorting emma dobbs 
 
 the sorting continued boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the stool the line dwindling slowly as professor mcgonagall passed the 
 
 oh hurry up ron moaned massaging his stomach 
 
 now ron the much more important than food said nearly headless nick as madley laura became a hufflepuff 
 
 course it is if dead snapped ron 
 
 i do hope this batch of gryffindors are up to scratch said nearly headless nick applauding as mcdonald natalie joined the gryffindor table we want to break our winning streak do we 
 
 gryffindor had won the championship for the last three years in a row 
 
 pritchard graham 
 
 slytherin 
 
 quirke orla 
 
 ravenclaw 
 
 and finally with whitby kevin hufflepuff the sorting ended professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away 
 
 about time said ron seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate 
 
 professor dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was smiling around at the students his arms opened wide in welcome 
 
 i have only two words to say to you he told them his deep voice echoing around the hall tuck in 
 
 hear hear said harry and ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes 
 
 nearly headless nick watched mournfully as harry ron and hermione loaded their own plates 
 
 aaah said ron with his mouth full of mashed potato 
 
 lucky a feast at all tonight you know said nearly headless nick there was trouble in the kitchens earlier 
 
 why wha appened said harry through a sizable chunk of steak 
 
 peeves of course said nearly headless nick shaking his head which wobbled dangerously he pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck the usual argument you know he wanted to attend the feast well quite out of the question you know what like utterly uncivilized see a plate of food without throwing it we held a council the fat friar was all for giving him the chance but most wisely in my opinion the bloody baron put his foot down 
 
 the bloody baron was the slytherin ghost a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains he was the only person at hogwarts who could really control peeves 
 
 yeah we thought peeves seemed hacked off about something said ron darkly so what did he do in the kitchens 
 
 oh the usual said nearly headless nick shrugging wreaked havoc and mayhem pots and pans everywhere place swimming in soup terrified the out of their wits 
 
 clang 
 
 hermione had knocked over her golden goblet pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth staining several feet of white linen orange but hermione paid no attention 
 
 there are here she said staring at nearly headless nick here at hogwarts 
 
 certainly said nearly headless nick looking surprised at her reaction the largest number in any dwelling in britain i believe over a hundred 
 
 never seen one said hermione 
 
 well they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day do they said nearly headless nick they come out at night to do a bit of cleaningsee to the fires and so mean not supposed to see them are you the mark of a good it that you know there 
 
 hermione stared at him 
 
 but they get paid she said they get holidays they and and sick leave and pensions and everything 
 
 nearly headless nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck 
 
 sick leave and pensions he said pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff want sick leave and pensions 
 
 hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her 
 
 oh said ron accidentally spraying harry with bits of yorkshire pudding oops sorry arry he swallowed you get them sick leave by starving yourself 
 
 slave labor said hermione breathing hard through her nose what made this dinner slave labor 
 
 and she refused to eat another bite 
 
 the rain was still drumming heavily against the high dark glass another clap of thunder shook the windows and the stormy ceiling flashed illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced instantly with puddings 
 
 treacle tart hermione said ron deliberately wafting its smell toward her spotted dick look chocolate gateau 
 
 but hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of professor mcgonagall that he gave up 
 
 when the puddings too had been demolished and the last crumbs had faded off the plates leaving them sparkling clean albus dumbledore got to his feet again the buzz of chatter filling the hall ceased almost at once so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard 
 
 so said dumbledore smiling around at them all now that we are all fed and watered hmph said hermione i must once more ask for your attention while i give out a few notices 
 
 mr filch the caretaker has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include screaming fanged frisbees and boomerangs the full list comprises some four hundred and items i believe and can be viewed in mr office if anybody would like to check it 
 
 the corners of mouth twitched he continued as ever i would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is to students as is the village of hogsmeade to all below third year 
 
 it is also my painful duty to inform you that the quidditch cup will not take place this year 
 
 what harry gasped he looked around at fred and george his fellow members of the quidditch team they were mouthing soundlessly at dumbledore apparently too appalled to speak dumbhedore went on this is due to an event that will be starting in october and continuing throughout the school year taking up much of the teachers time and energy but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts 
 
 but at that moment there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the great hall banged open 
 
 a man stood in the doorway leaning upon a long staff shrouded in a black traveling cloak every head in the great hall swiveled toward the stranger suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling he lowered his hood shook out a long mane of grizzled dark gray hair then began to walk up toward the teachers table 
 
 a dull clunk echoed through the hall on his every other step he reached the end of the top table turned right and limped heavily toward dumbledore another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling hermione gasped 
 
 the lightning had thrown the face into sharp relief and it was a face unlike any harry had ever looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like and was none too skilled with a chisel every inch of skin seemed to be scarred the mouth looked like a diagonal gash and a large chunk of the nose was missing but it was the eyes that made him frightening 
 
 one of them was small dark and beady the other was large round as a coin and a vivid electric blue the blue eye was moving ceaselessly without blinking and was rolling up down and from side to side quite independently of the normal eye and then it rolled right over pointing into the back of the head so that all they could see was whiteness 
 
 the stranger reached dumbledore he stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face and dumbhedore shook it muttering words harry hear he seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his side 
 
 the stranger sat down shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face pulled a plate of sausages toward him raised it to what was left of his nose and sniffed it he then took a small knife out of his pocket speared a sausage on the end of it and began to eat his normal eye was fixed upon the sausages but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket taking in the hall and the students 
 
 may i introduce our new defense against the dark arts teacher said dumbledore brightly into the silence professor moody 
 
 it was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause but none of the staff or students chapped except dumbledore and hagrid who both put their hands together and applauded but the sound echoed dismally into the silence and they stopped fairly quickly everyone else seemed too transfixed by bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him 
 
 moody harry muttered to ron moody the one your dad went to help this morning 
 
 must be said ron in a low awed voice 
 
 what happened to him hermione whispered what happened to his face 
 
 dunno ron whispered back watching moody with fascination 
 
 moody seemed totally indifferent to his welcome ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him he reached again into his traveling cloak pulled out a hip flask and took a long draught from it as he lifted his arm to drink his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground and harry saw below the table several inches of carved wooden leg ending in a clawed foot 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat 
 
 as i was saying he said smiling at the sea of students before him all of whom were still gazing transfixed at moody we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months an event that has not been held for over a century it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this year 
 
 joking said fred weasley loudly 
 
 the tension that had filled the hall ever since arrival suddenly broke nearly everyone laughed and dumbledore chuckled appreciatively 
 
 i am not joking mr weasley he said though now that you mention it i did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll a hag and a leprechaun who all go into a bar 
 
 professor mcgonagall cleared her throat loudly 
 
 er but maybe this is not the timeno said dumbledore where was i ah yes the triwizard tournamentwell some of you will not know what this tournament involves so i hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation and allow their attention to wander freely 
 
 the triwizard tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest european schools of wizardry hogwarts beauxbatons and durmstrang a champion was selected to represent each school and the three champions competed in three magical tasks the schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities until that is the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued 
 
 death toll hermione whispered looking alarmed but her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the hall many of them were whispering excitedly to one another and harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago 
 
 there have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament dumbledore continued none of which has been very successful however our own departments of international magical cooperation and magical games and sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt we have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger 
 
 the heads of beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving with their contenders in october and the selection of the three champions will take place at halloween an impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the triwizard cup the glory of their school and a thousand galleons personal prize money 
 
 going for it fred weasley hissed down the table his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches he was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the hogwarts champion at every house table harry could see people either gazing raptly at dumbledore or else whispering fervently to their neighbors but then dumbledore spoke again and the hall quieted once more 
 
 eager though i know all of you will be to bring the triwizard cup to hogwarts he said the heads of the participating schools along with the ministry of magic have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year only students who are of age that is to say seventeen years or older will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration this dumbledore raised his voice slightly for several people had made noises of outrage at these words and the weasley twins were suddenly looking furious is a measure we feel is necessary given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous whatever precautions we take and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them i will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them hogwarts champion his light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over and mutinous faces i therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen 
 
 the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving in october and remaining with us for the greater part of this year i know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give your support to the hogwarts champion when he or she is selected and now it is late and i know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning bedtime chop chop 
 
 dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to moody there was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall 
 
 they do that said george weasley who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door but was standing up and glaring at dumbledore seventeen in april why we have a shot 
 
 not stopping me entering said fred stubbornly also scowling at the top table the get to do all sorts of stuff never be allowed to do normally and a thousand galleons prize money 
 
 yeah said ron a faraway look on his face yeah a thousand galleons 
 
 come on said hermione be the only ones left here if you move 
 
 harry ron hermione fred and george set off for the entrance hall fred and george debating the ways in which dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament 
 
 this impartial judge going to decide who the champions are said harry 
 
 dunno said fred but them have to fool i reckon a couple of drops of aging potion might do it george 
 
 dumbledore knows not of age though said ron 
 
 yeah but not the one who decides who the champion is is he said fred shrewdly sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are trying to stop us giving our names 
 
 people have died though said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another narrower staircase 
 
 yeah said fred airily but that was years ago it anyway the fun without a bit of risk hey ron what if we find out how to get round dumbledore fancy entering 
 
 what reckon ron asked harry be cool to enter it but i they might want someone if learned enough 
 
 i definitely came gloomy voice from behind fred and george 
 
 i expect my want me to try though always going on about how i should be upholding the family honor just have to oops 
 
 foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase there were many of these trick stairs at hogwarts it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step but memory was notoriously poor harry and ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked laughing wheezily 
 
 shut it you said ron banging down its visor as they passed 
 
 they made their way up to the entrance to gryffindor tower which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress 
 
 password she said as they approached 
 
 balderdash said george a prefect downstairs told me 
 
 the portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed a crackling fire warmed the circular common room which was full of squashy armchairs and tables hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look and harry distinctly heard her mutter slave labor before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls dormitory 
 
 harry ron and neville climbed up the last spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory which was situated at the top of the tower five beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls each with its trunk at the foot dean and seamus were already getting into bed seamus had pinned his ireland rosette to his headboard and dean had tacked up a poster of viktor krum over his bedside table his old poster of the west ham football team was pinned right next to it 
 
 mental ron sighed shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players 
 
 harry ron and neville got into their pajamas and into bed someone a no doubt had placed warming pans between the sheets it was extremely comfortable lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside 
 
 i might go in for it you know ron said sleepily through the darkness if fred and george find out how tothe never know do you 
 
 not 
 
 harry rolled over in bed a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was had become hogwarts championhe was standing on the grounds his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school all of whom were applauding and screaminghe had just won the triwizard tournament face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd her face glowing with admiration 
 
 harry grinned into his pillow exceptionally glad that ron see what he could 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelvethe triwizard tournamentcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 through the gates flanked with statues of winged boars and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale leaning against the window harry could see hogwarts coming nearer its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps people who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle harry ron hermione and neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous entrance hall with its magnificent marble staircase 
 
 blimey said ron shaking his head and sending water everywhere if that keeps up the going to overflow soak arrgh 
 
 a large red balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto head and exploded drenched and sputtering ron staggered sideways into harry just as a second water bomb dropped narrowly missing hermione it burst at feet sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks people all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire harry looked up and saw floating twenty feet above them peeves the poltergeist a little man in a hat and orange bow tie his wide malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again 
 
 peeves yelled an angry voice peeves come down here at once 
 
 professor mcgonagall deputy headmistress and head of gryffindor house had come dashing out of the great hall she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling 
 
 ouch sorry miss granger 
 
 all right professor hermione gasped massaging her throat 
 
 peeves get down here now barked professor mcgonagall straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her spectacles 
 
 not doing nothing cackled peeves lobbing a water bomb at several girls who screamed and dived into the great hall already wet they little squirts wheeeeeeeeee and he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived 
 
 i shall call the headmaster shouted professor mcgonagall warning you peeves 
 
 peeves stuck out his tongue threw the last of his water bombs into the air and zoomed off up the marble staircase cackling insanely 
 
 well move along then said professor mcgonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd into the great hall come on 
 
 harry ron and hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face 
 
 the great hall looked its usual splendid self decorated for the feast golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles floating over the tables in midair the four long house tables were packed with chattering students at the top of the hall the staff sat along one side of a fifth table facing their pupils it was much warmer in here harry ron and hermione walked past the slytherins the ravenclaws and the hufflepuffs and sat down with the rest of the gryffindors at the far side of the hall next to nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost pearly white and semitransparent nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet but with a particularly large ruff which served the dual purpose of looking and insuring that his head wobble too much on his partially severed neck 
 
 good evening he said beaming at them 
 
 says who said harry taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water hope they hurry up with the sorting starving 
 
 the sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year but by an unlucky combination of circumstances harry been present at one since his own he was quite looking forward to it just then a highly excited breathless voice called down the table 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a third year to whom harry was something of a hero 
 
 hi colin said harry warily 
 
 harry guess what guess what harry my starting my brother dennis 
 
 er good said harry 
 
 really excited said colin practically bouncing up and down in his seat i just hope in gryffindor keep your fingers crossed eh harry 
 
 er yeah all right said harry he turned back to hermione ron and nearly headless nick brothers and sisters usually go in the same houses they he said he was judging by the weasleys all seven of whom had been put into gryffindor 
 
 oh no not necessarily said hermione parvati in ravenclaw and identical think be together you 
 
 harry looked up at the staff table there seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual hagrid of course was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years professor mcgonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor but there was another empty chair too and harry think who else was missing 
 
 the new defense against the dark arts teacher said hermione who was also looking up at the teachers 
 
 they had never yet had a defense against the dark arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms favorite by far had been professor lupin who had resigned last year he looked up and down the staff table there was definitely no new face there 
 
 maybe they get anyone said hermione looking anxious 
 
 harry scanned the table more carefully tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside professor sprout the herbology teacher whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair she was talking to professor sinistra of the astronomy department on professor other side was the potions master snape least favorite person at hogwarts loathing of snape was matched only by hatred of him a hatred which had if possible intensified last year when harry had helped sirius escape right under overlarge nose snape and sirius had been enemies since their own school days 
 
 on other side was an empty seat which harry guessed was professor next to it and in the very center of the table sat professor dumbledore the headmaster his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons the tips of long thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them staring up at the ceiling through his spectacles as though lost in thought harry glanced up at the ceiling too it was enchanted to look like the sky outside and he had never seen it look this stormy black and purple clouds were swirling across it and as another thunderclap sounded outside a fork of lightning flashed across it 
 
 oh hurry up ron moaned beside harry i could eat a hippogriff 
 
 the words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the great hall opened and silence fell professor mcgonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the hall if harry ron and hermione were wet it was nothing to how these first years looked they appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed all of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school all of them except the smallest of the lot a boy with mousy hair who was wrapped in what harry recognized as moleskin overcoat the coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent his small face protruded from over the collar looking almost painfully excited when he had lined up with his peers he caught colin eye gave a double and mouthed i fell in the lake he looked positively delighted about it 
 
 professor mcgonagall now placed a stool on the ground before the first years and on top of it an extremely old dirty patched hat the first years stared at it so did everyone else for a moment there was silence then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat broke into song 
 
 a thousand years or more ago 
 when i was newly lived four wizards of renown 
 whose names are still well known

 the great hall rang with applause as the sorting hat finished 
 
 not the song it sang when it sorted us said harry clapping along with everyone else 
 
 sings a different one every year said ron got to be a pretty boring life it being a hat i suppose it spends all year making up the next one 
 
 professor mcgonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment 
 
 when i call out your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool she told the first years when the hat announces your house you will go and sit at the appropriate table 
 
 ackerley stewart 
 
 a boy walked forward visibly trembling from head to foot picked up the sorting hat put it on and sat down on the stool 
 
 ravenclaw shouted the hat 
 
 stewart ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the ravenclaw table where everyone was applauding him harry caught a glimpse of cho the ravenclaw seeker cheering stewart ackerley as he sat down for a fleeting second harry had a strange desire to join the ravenclaw table too 
 
 baddock malcolm 
 
 slytherin 
 
 the table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers harry could see malfoy clapping as baddock joined the slytherins harry wondered whether baddock knew that slytherin house had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other fred and george hissed malcolm baddock as he sat down 
 
 branstone eleanor 
 
 hufflepuff 
 
 cauldwell owen 
 
 hufflepuff 
 
 creevey dennis 
 
 tiny dennis creevey staggered forward tripping over moleskin just as hagrid himself sidled into the hall through a door behind the teachers table about twice as tall as a normal man and at least three times as broad hagrid with his long wild tangled black hair and beard looked slightly alarming a misleading impression for harry ron and hermione knew hagrid to possess a very kind nature he winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched dennis creevey putting on the sorting hat the rip at the brim opened wide 
 
 gryffindor the hat shouted 
 
 hagrid clapped along with the gryffindors as dennis creevey beaming widely took off the hat placed it back on the stool and hurried over to join his brother 
 
 colin i fell in he said shrilly throwing himself into an empty seat it was brilliant and something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat 
 
 cool said colin just as excitedly it was probably the giant squid dennis 
 
 wow said dennis as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a lake and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster 
 
 dennis dennis see that boy down there the one with the black hair and glasses see him know who he is dennis 
 
 harry looked away staring very hard at the sorting hat now sorting emma dobbs 
 
 the sorting continued boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the stool the line dwindling slowly as professor mcgonagall passed the 
 
 oh hurry up ron moaned massaging his stomach 
 
 now ron the much more important than food said nearly headless nick as madley laura became a hufflepuff 
 
 course it is if dead snapped ron 
 
 i do hope this batch of gryffindors are up to scratch said nearly headless nick applauding as mcdonald natalie joined the gryffindor table we want to break our winning streak do we 
 
 gryffindor had won the championship for the last three years in a row 
 
 pritchard graham 
 
 slytherin 
 
 quirke orla 
 
 ravenclaw 
 
 and finally with whitby kevin hufflepuff the sorting ended professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away 
 
 about time said ron seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate 
 
 professor dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was smiling around at the students his arms opened wide in welcome 
 
 i have only two words to say to you he told them his deep voice echoing around the hall tuck in 
 
 hear hear said harry and ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes 
 
 nearly headless nick watched mournfully as harry ron and hermione loaded their own plates 
 
 aaah said ron with his mouth full of mashed potato 
 
 lucky a feast at all tonight you know said nearly headless nick there was trouble in the kitchens earlier 
 
 why wha appened said harry through a sizable chunk of steak 
 
 peeves of course said nearly headless nick shaking his head which wobbled dangerously he pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck the usual argument you know he wanted to attend the feast well quite out of the question you know what like utterly uncivilized see a plate of food without throwing it we held a council the fat friar was all for giving him the chance but most wisely in my opinion the bloody baron put his foot down 
 
 the bloody baron was the slytherin ghost a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains he was the only person at hogwarts who could really control peeves 
 
 yeah we thought peeves seemed hacked off about something said ron darkly so what did he do in the kitchens 
 
 oh the usual said nearly headless nick shrugging wreaked havoc and mayhem pots and pans everywhere place swimming in soup terrified the out of their wits 
 
 clang 
 
 hermione had knocked over her golden goblet pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth staining several feet of white linen orange but hermione paid no attention 
 
 there are here she said staring at nearly headless nick here at hogwarts 
 
 certainly said nearly headless nick looking surprised at her reaction the largest number in any dwelling in britain i believe over a hundred 
 
 never seen one said hermione 
 
 well they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day do they said nearly headless nick they come out at night to do a bit of cleaningsee to the fires and so mean not supposed to see them are you the mark of a good it that you know there 
 
 hermione stared at him 
 
 but they get paid she said they get holidays they and and sick leave and pensions and everything 
 
 nearly headless nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck 
 
 sick leave and pensions he said pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff want sick leave and pensions 
 
 hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her 
 
 oh said ron accidentally spraying harry with bits of yorkshire pudding oops sorry arry he swallowed you get them sick leave by starving yourself 
 
 slave labor said hermione breathing hard through her nose what made this dinner slave labor 
 
 and she refused to eat another bite 
 
 the rain was still drumming heavily against the high dark glass another clap of thunder shook the windows and the stormy ceiling flashed illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced instantly with puddings 
 
 treacle tart hermione said ron deliberately wafting its smell toward her spotted dick look chocolate gateau 
 
 but hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of professor mcgonagall that he gave up 
 
 when the puddings too had been demolished and the last crumbs had faded off the plates leaving them sparkling clean albus dumbledore got to his feet again the buzz of chatter filling the hall ceased almost at once so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard 
 
 so said dumbledore smiling around at them all now that we are all fed and watered hmph said hermione i must once more ask for your attention while i give out a few notices 
 
 mr filch the caretaker has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include screaming fanged frisbees and boomerangs the full list comprises some four hundred and items i believe and can be viewed in mr office if anybody would like to check it 
 
 the corners of mouth twitched he continued as ever i would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is to students as is the village of hogsmeade to all below third year 
 
 it is also my painful duty to inform you that the quidditch cup will not take place this year 
 
 what harry gasped he looked around at fred and george his fellow members of the quidditch team they were mouthing soundlessly at dumbledore apparently too appalled to speak dumbhedore went on this is due to an event that will be starting in october and continuing throughout the school year taking up much of the teachers time and energy but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts 
 
 but at that moment there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the great hall banged open 
 
 a man stood in the doorway leaning upon a long staff shrouded in a black traveling cloak every head in the great hall swiveled toward the stranger suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling he lowered his hood shook out a long mane of grizzled dark gray hair then began to walk up toward the teachers table 
 
 a dull clunk echoed through the hall on his every other step he reached the end of the top table turned right and limped heavily toward dumbledore another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling hermione gasped 
 
 the lightning had thrown the face into sharp relief and it was a face unlike any harry had ever looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like and was none too skilled with a chisel every inch of skin seemed to be scarred the mouth looked like a diagonal gash and a large chunk of the nose was missing but it was the eyes that made him frightening 
 
 one of them was small dark and beady the other was large round as a coin and a vivid electric blue the blue eye was moving ceaselessly without blinking and was rolling up down and from side to side quite independently of the normal eye and then it rolled right over pointing into the back of the head so that all they could see was whiteness 
 
 the stranger reached dumbledore he stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face and dumbhedore shook it muttering words harry hear he seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his side 
 
 the stranger sat down shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face pulled a plate of sausages toward him raised it to what was left of his nose and sniffed it he then took a small knife out of his pocket speared a sausage on the end of it and began to eat his normal eye was fixed upon the sausages but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket taking in the hall and the students 
 
 may i introduce our new defense against the dark arts teacher said dumbledore brightly into the silence professor moody 
 
 it was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause but none of the staff or students chapped except dumbledore and hagrid who both put their hands together and applauded but the sound echoed dismally into the silence and they stopped fairly quickly everyone else seemed too transfixed by bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him 
 
 moody harry muttered to ron moody the one your dad went to help this morning 
 
 must be said ron in a low awed voice 
 
 what happened to him hermione whispered what happened to his face 
 
 dunno ron whispered back watching moody with fascination 
 
 moody seemed totally indifferent to his welcome ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him he reached again into his traveling cloak pulled out a hip flask and took a long draught from it as he lifted his arm to drink his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground and harry saw below the table several inches of carved wooden leg ending in a clawed foot 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat 
 
 as i was saying he said smiling at the sea of students before him all of whom were still gazing transfixed at moody we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months an event that has not been held for over a century it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this year 
 
 joking said fred weasley loudly 
 
 the tension that had filled the hall ever since arrival suddenly broke nearly everyone laughed and dumbledore chuckled appreciatively 
 
 i am not joking mr weasley he said though now that you mention it i did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll a hag and a leprechaun who all go into a bar 
 
 professor mcgonagall cleared her throat loudly 
 
 er but maybe this is not the timeno said dumbledore where was i ah yes the triwizard tournamentwell some of you will not know what this tournament involves so i hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation and allow their attention to wander freely 
 
 the triwizard tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest european schools of wizardry hogwarts beauxbatons and durmstrang a champion was selected to represent each school and the three champions competed in three magical tasks the schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities until that is the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued 
 
 death toll hermione whispered looking alarmed but her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the hall many of them were whispering excitedly to one another and harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago 
 
 there have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament dumbledore continued none of which has been very successful however our own departments of international magical cooperation and magical games and sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt we have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger 
 
 the heads of beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving with their contenders in october and the selection of the three champions will take place at halloween an impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the triwizard cup the glory of their school and a thousand galleons personal prize money 
 
 going for it fred weasley hissed down the table his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches he was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the hogwarts champion at every house table harry could see people either gazing raptly at dumbledore or else whispering fervently to their neighbors but then dumbledore spoke again and the hall quieted once more 
 
 eager though i know all of you will be to bring the triwizard cup to hogwarts he said the heads of the participating schools along with the ministry of magic have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year only students who are of age that is to say seventeen years or older will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration this dumbledore raised his voice slightly for several people had made noises of outrage at these words and the weasley twins were suddenly looking furious is a measure we feel is necessary given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous whatever precautions we take and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them i will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them hogwarts champion his light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over and mutinous faces i therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen 
 
 the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving in october and remaining with us for the greater part of this year i know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give your support to the hogwarts champion when he or she is selected and now it is late and i know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning bedtime chop chop 
 
 dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to moody there was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall 
 
 they do that said george weasley who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door but was standing up and glaring at dumbledore seventeen in april why we have a shot 
 
 not stopping me entering said fred stubbornly also scowling at the top table the get to do all sorts of stuff never be allowed to do normally and a thousand galleons prize money 
 
 yeah said ron a faraway look on his face yeah a thousand galleons 
 
 come on said hermione be the only ones left here if you move 
 
 harry ron hermione fred and george set off for the entrance hall fred and george debating the ways in which dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament 
 
 this impartial judge going to decide who the champions are said harry 
 
 dunno said fred but them have to fool i reckon a couple of drops of aging potion might do it george 
 
 dumbledore knows not of age though said ron 
 
 yeah but not the one who decides who the champion is is he said fred shrewdly sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are trying to stop us giving our names 
 
 people have died though said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another narrower staircase 
 
 yeah said fred airily but that was years ago it anyway the fun without a bit of risk hey ron what if we find out how to get round dumbledore fancy entering 
 
 what reckon ron asked harry be cool to enter it but i they might want someone if learned enough 
 
 i definitely came gloomy voice from behind fred and george 
 
 i expect my want me to try though always going on about how i should be upholding the family honor just have to oops 
 
 foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase there were many of these trick stairs at hogwarts it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step but memory was notoriously poor harry and ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked laughing wheezily 
 
 shut it you said ron banging down its visor as they passed 
 
 they made their way up to the entrance to gryffindor tower which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress 
 
 password she said as they approached 
 
 balderdash said george a prefect downstairs told me 
 
 the portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed a crackling fire warmed the circular common room which was full of squashy armchairs and tables hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look and harry distinctly heard her mutter slave labor before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls dormitory 
 
 harry ron and neville climbed up the last spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory which was situated at the top of the tower five beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls each with its trunk at the foot dean and seamus were already getting into bed seamus had pinned his ireland rosette to his headboard and dean had tacked up a poster of viktor krum over his bedside table his old poster of the west ham football team was pinned right next to it 
 
 mental ron sighed shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players 
 
 harry ron and neville got into their pajamas and into bed someone a no doubt had placed warming pans between the sheets it was extremely comfortable lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside 
 
 i might go in for it you know ron said sleepily through the darkness if fred and george find out how tothe never know do you 
 
 not 
 
 harry rolled over in bed a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was had become hogwarts championhe was standing on the grounds his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school all of whom were applauding and screaminghe had just won the triwizard tournament face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd her face glowing with admiration 
 
 harry grinned into his pillow exceptionally glad that ron see what he could 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelve professor umbridgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before harry had even put on his socks 
 
 does he think turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long asked harry loudly as the hem of robes wnipped out of sight 
 
 worry about it harry dean muttered hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder just 
 
 but apparently he was unable to say exactly what seamus was and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room 
 
 neville and ron both gave harry an look but harry was not much consoled how much more of this would he have to take 
 
 the matter asked hermione five minutes later catching up with harry and ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast you look absolutelyoh for heavens sake 
 
 she was staring at the noticeboard where a large new sign had been put up 
 
 gallons of galleons 
 
 pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings 
 
 like to earn a little extra gold 
 
 contact fred and george weasley gryffindor common room 
 
 for simple virtually painless jobs 
 
 we regret that all work is undertaken at own risk 
 
 they are the limit said hermione grimly taking down the sign which fred and george had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first hogsmeade weekend which was to be in october have to talk to them ron 
 
 ron looked positively alarmed 
 
 why 
 
 because prefects said hermione as they climbed out through the portrait hole up to us to stop this kind of thing 
 
 ron said nothing harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping fred and george doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting 
 
 anyway up harry hermione continued as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards all of whom ignored them being engrossed in their own conversation you look really angry about something 
 
 seamus reckons lying about said ron succinctly when harry did not respond 
 
 hermione who harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf sighed 
 
 yes lavender thinks so too she said gloomily 
 
 been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not a lying prat have you harry said loudly 
 
 no said hermione calmly i told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you actually and it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats harry because in case you noticed ron and i are on your side 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 sorry said harry in a low voice 
 
 quite all right said hermione with dignity then she shook her head you remember what dumbledore said at the last feast 
 
 harry and ron both looked at her blankly and hermione sighed again 
 
 about he said his gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust 
 
 how do you remember stuff like that asked ron looking at her in admiration 
 
 i listen ron said hermione with a touch of asperity 
 
 so do i but i still tell you exactly what 
 
 the point hermione pressed on loudly is that this sort of thing is exactly what dumbledore was talking about only been back two months and already started fighting among ourselves and the sorting warning was the same stand together be united 
 
 and harry got it right last night retorted ron if that means supposed to get matey with the slytherinsfat chance 
 
 well i think a pity not trying for a bit of unity said hermione crossly 
 
 they had reached the foot of the marble staircase a line of ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall they caught sight of harry and hurried to form a tighter group as though frightened he might attack stragglers 
 
 yeah we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that said harry sarcastically 
 
 they followed the ravenclaws into the great hall all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered professor was chatting to professor sinistra the astronomy teacher and hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence the enchanted ceiling above them echoed mood it was a miserable grey 
 
 dumbledore even mention how long that staying he said as they made their way across to the gryffindor table 
 
 maybe said hermione thoughtfully 
 
 what said both harry and ron together 
 
 well maybe he want to draw attention to hagrid not being here 
 
 what mean draw attention to it said ron how could we not notice 
 
 before hermione could answer a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to harry 
 
 hi angelina 
 
 hi she said briskly good summer and without waiting for an answer listen been made gryffindor quidditch captain 
 
 nice one said harry grinning at her he suspected pep talks might not be as as oliver had been which could only be an improvement 
 
 yeah well we need a new keeper now left tryouts are on friday at five and i want the whole team there all right then we can see how the new fit in 
 
 ok said harry 
 
 angelina smiled at him and departed 
 
 forgotten wood had left said hermione vaguely as she sat down beside ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her i suppose that will make quite a difference to the team 
 
 i said harry taking the bench opposite he was a good keeper 
 
 still it hurt to have some new blood will it said ron 
 
 with a whoosh and a clatter hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows they descended all over the hall bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water it was clearly raining hard outside hedwig was nowhere to be seen but harry was hardly surprised his only correspondent was sirius and he doubted sirius would have anything new to tell him after only hours apart hermione however had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way gor a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden daily prophet in its beak 
 
 what are you still getting that for said harry irritably thinking of seamus as hermione placed a knut in the leather pouch on the leg and it took off again not bothering load of rubbish 
 
 best to know what the enemy is saying said hermione darkly and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it not emerging until harry and ron had finished eating 
 
 nothing she said simply rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate nothing about you or dumbledore or anything 
 
 professor mcgonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables 
 
 look at today groaned ron history of magic double potions divination and double defence against the dark arts binns snape trelawney and that umbridge woman all in one day i wish fred and hurry up and get those skiving snackboxes sorted 
 
 do mine ears deceive me said fred arriving with george and squeezing on to the bench beside harry hogwarts prefects surely wish to skive off lessons 
 
 look what got today said ron grumpily shoving his timetable under nose the worst monday ever seen 
 
 fair point little bro said fred scanning the column you can have a bit of nosebleed nougat cheap if you like 
 
 it cheap said ron suspiciously 
 
 because keep bleeding till you shrivel up we got an antidote yet said george helping himself to a kipper 
 
 cheers said ron moodily pocketing his timetable but i think take the lessons 
 
 and speaking of your skiving snackboxes said hermione eyeing fred and george beadily you advertise for testers on the gryffindor noticeboard 
 
 says who said george looking astonished 
 
 says me said hermione and ron 
 
 leave me out of it said ron hastily 
 
 hermione glared at him fred and george sniggered 
 
 be singing a different tune soon enough hermione said fred thickly buttering a crumpet starting your fifth year be begging us for a snackbox before long 
 
 and why would starting fifth year mean i want a skiving snackbox asked hermione 
 
 fifth owl year said george 
 
 so 
 
 so got your exams coming up you be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone be rubbed raw said fred with satisfaction 
 
 half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to owls said george happily tears and tantrums patricia stimpson kept coming over faint 
 
 kenneth towler came out in boils remember said fred remmiscently 
 
 cause you put bulbadox powder in his pyjamas said george 
 
 oh yeah said fred grinning forgotten hard to keep track sometimes it 
 
 anyway a nightmare of a year the fifth said george if you care about exam results anyway fred and i managed to keep our peckers up somehow 
 
 yeah you got what was it three owls each said ron 
 
 yep said fred unconcernedly but we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement 
 
 we seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year said george brightly now that got 
 
 he broke off at a warning look from harry who knew george had been about to mention the triwizard winnings he had given them 
 
 now that got our owls george said hastily i mean do we really need newts but we think mum could take us leaving school early not on top of percy turning out to be the biggest prat 
 
 not going to waste our last year here though said fred looking affectionately around at the great hall going to use it to do a bit of market research find out exactly what the average hogwarts student requires from a joke shop carefully evaluate the results of our research then produce products to fit the demand 
 
 but where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop hermione asked sceptically going to need all the ingredients and materialsand premises too i suppose 
 
 harry did not look at the twins his face felt hot he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it he heard fred say overhead ask us no questions and tell you no lies hermione george if we get there early we might be able to sell a few extendable ears before herbology 
 
 harry emerged from under the table to see fred and george walking away each carrying a stack of toast 
 
 what did that mean said hermione looking from harry to ron ask us no questions does that mean already got some gold to start a joke shop 
 
 you know been wondering about that said ron his brow furrowed they bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and i understand where they got the galleons 
 
 harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters 
 
 reckon true this going to be really tough because of the exams 
 
 oh yeah said ron bound to be it owls are really important affect the jobs you can apply for and everything we get career advice too later this year bill told me so you can choose what newts you want to do next year 
 
 know what you want to do after hogwarts harry asked the other two as they left the great hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their history of magic classroom 
 
 not really said ron slowly except well 
 
 he looked slightly sheepish 
 
 what harry urged him 
 
 well be cool to be an auror said ron in an voice 
 
 yeah it would said harry fervently 
 
 but like the elite said ron got to be really good what about you hermione 
 
 i know she said i think like to do something really worthwhile 
 
 an worthwhile said harry 
 
 yes it is but not the only worthwhile thing said hermione thoughtfully i mean if i could take spew further 
 
 harry and ron carefully avoided looking at each other 
 
 history of magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind professor binns their ghost teacher had a wheezy droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes five in warm weather he never varied the form of their lessons but lectured them without pausing while they took notes or rather gazed sleepily into space harry and ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying notes before exams she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of voice 
 
 today they suffered an hour and a droning on the subject of giant wars harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another hands this subject might have been mildly interesting but then his brain disengaged and he spent the remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with ron while hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye 
 
 how would it be she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break binns drifting away through the blackboard if i refused to lend you my notes this year 
 
 fail our owl said ron if you want that on your conscience hermione 
 
 well deserve it she snapped you even try to listen to him do you 
 
 we do try said ron we just got your brains or your memory or your concentration just cleverer than we areis it nice to rub it in 
 
 oh give me that rubbish said hermione but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard 
 
 a fine misty drizzle was falling so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges harry ron and hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly september air and talking about what snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year they had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult just to catch them off guard after a holiday when someone walked around the corner towards them 
 
 hello harry 
 
 it was cho chang and what was more she was on her own again this was most unusual cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the yule ball 
 
 hi said harry feeling his face grow hot at least not covered in stinksap this time he told himself cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines 
 
 you got that stuff off then 
 
 yeah said harry trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying so did you er have a good summer 
 
 the moment he had said this he wished he had been boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected something seemed to tauten in her face but she said oh it was all right you know 
 
 is that a tornados badge ron demanded suddenly pointing to the front of robes where a badge emblazoned with a double gold t was pinned you support them do you 
 
 yeah i do said cho 
 
 have you always supported them or just since they started winning the league said ron in what harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice 
 
 supported them since i was six said cho coolly anyway see you harry 
 
 she walked away hermione waited until cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on ron 
 
 you are so tactless 
 
 what i only asked her if 
 
 you tell she wanted to talk to harry on her own 
 
 so she done i stopping 
 
 why on earth were you attacking her about her quidditch team 
 
 attacking i attacking her i was only 
 
 who cares if she supports the tornados 
 
 oh come on half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season 
 
 but what does it matter 
 
 it means not real fans just jumping on the bandwagon 
 
 the bell said harry dully because ron and hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it they did not stop arguing all the way down to snapes dungeon which gave harry plenty of time to reflect that between neville and ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country 
 
 and yet he thought as they joined the queue lining up outside classroom door she had chosen to come and talk to him she she had been girlfriend she could easily have hated harry for coming out of the triwizard maze alive when cedric had died yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way not as though she thought him mad or a liar or in some horrible way responsible for death yes she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him and that made the second time in two days and at this thought spirits rose even the ominous sound of dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest he filed into the classroom behind ron and hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back where he sat down between ron and hermione and ignored the huffy irritable noises now issuing from both of them 
 
 settle down said snape coldly shutting the door behind him 
 
 there was no real need for the call to order the moment the class had heard the door close quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped mere presence was usually enough to ensure a silence 
 
 before we begin lesson said snape sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all i think it appropriate to remind you that next june you will be sitting an important examination during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are i expect you to scrape an acceptable in your owl or suffer my displeasure 
 
 his gaze lingered this time on neville who gulped 
 
 after this year of course many of you will cease studying with me snape went on i take only the very best into my newt potions class which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye 
 
 his eyes rested on harry and his lip curled harry glared back feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up potions after fifth year 
 
 but we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell said snape softly so whether or not you are intending to attempt newt i advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level i have come to expect from my owl students 
 
 today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at ordinary wizarding level the draught of peace a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation be warned if you are too with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing on left hermione sat up a little straighter her expression one of utmost attention the ingredients and method snape flicked his wand are on the appeared there you will find everything you need he flicked his wand again in the store cupboard the door of the said cupboard sprang open you have an hour and a half start 
 
 just as harry ron and hermione had predicted snape could hardly have set them a more difficult fiddly potion the ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times firstly in clockwise then in directions the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added 
 
 a light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion called snape with ten minutes left to go 
 
 harry who was sweating profusely looked desperately around the dungeon his own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam was spitting green sparks seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand as they seemed to be going out the surface of potion however was a shimmering mist of silver vapour and as snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment which meant he could find nothing to criticise 
 
 at cauldron however snape stopped and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his face 
 
 potter what is this supposed to be 
 
 the slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly they loved hearing snape taunt harry 
 
 the draught of peace said harry tensely 
 
 tell me potter said snape softly can you read 
 
 draco malfoy laughed 
 
 yes i can said harry his fingers clenched tightly around his wand 
 
 read the third line of the instructions for me potter 
 
 harry squinted at the blackboard it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of steam now filling the dungeon 
 
 add powdered moonstone stir three times allow to simmer for seven minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore 
 
 his heart sank he had not added syrup of hellebore but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes 
 
 did you do everything on the third line potter 
 
 no said harry very quietly 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 no said harry more loudly i forgot the hellebore 
 
 i know you did potter which means that this mess is utterly worthless evanesce 
 
 the contents of potion vanished he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron 
 
 those of you who have managed to read the instructions fill one flagon with a sample of your potion label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing said snape homework twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in to be handed in on thursday 
 
 while everyone around him filled their flagons harry cleared away his things seething his potion had been no worse than which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs or which had achieved the consistency of cement and which neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron yet it was he harry who would be receiving zero marks for the work he stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat watching everyone else march up to desk with filled and corked flagons when at long last the bell rang harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time ron and hermione joined him in the great hall the ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning rain was lashing the high windows 
 
 that was really unfair said hermione consolingly sitting down next to harry and helping herself to pie your potion nearly as bad as when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire 
 
 yeah well said harry glowering at his plate since when has snape ever been fair to me 
 
 neither of the others answered all three of them knew that snape and mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment harry had set foot in hogwarts 
 
 i did think he might be a bit better this year said hermione in a disappointed voice i mean you know she looked around carefully there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table now in the order and everything 
 
 poisonous toadstools change their spots said ron sagely anyway always thought dumbledore was cracked to trust snape the evidence he ever really stopped working for 
 
 i think probably got plenty of evidence even if he share it with you ron snapped hermione 
 
 oh shut up the pair of you said harry heavily as ron opened his mouth to argue back hermione and ron both froze looking angry and offended you give it a rest said harry always having a go at each other driving me mad and abandoning his pie he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there 
 
 he walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time past the many students hurrying towards lunch the anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him and the vision of ron and shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction serve them right he thought why they give it a rest bickering all the time enough to drive anyone up the wall 
 
 he passed the large picture of sir cadogan the knight on a landing sir cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at harry who ignored him 
 
 come back you scurvy dog stand fast and fight yelled sir cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor but harry merely walked on and when sir cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighbouring picture he was rebuffed by its inhabitant a large and wolfhound 
 
 harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of north tower consequently he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to sybill classroom when the bell rang 
 
 after potions divination was least favourite class which was due mainly to professor habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons a thin woman heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads she always reminded harry of some kind of insect with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes she was busy putting copies of battered books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when harry entered the room but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows the rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes ron emerged from the trapdoor looked around carefully spotted harry and made directly for him or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables chairs and overstuffed pouffes 
 
 hermione and me have stopped arguing he said sitting down beside harry 
 
 good grunted harry 
 
 but hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us said ron 
 
 i m not 
 
 just passing on the message said ron talking over him but i reckon right not our fault how seamus and snape treat you 
 
 i never said it 
 
 said professor trelawney in her usual misty dreamy voice and harry broke off again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself and welcome back to divination i have of course been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays and am delighted to see that you have all returned to hogwarts safelyas of course i knew you would 
 
 you will find on the tables before you copies of the dream oracle by inigo imago dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your owl not of course that i believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination if you have the seeing eye certificates and grades matter very little however the headmaster likes you to sit the examination so 
 
 her voice trailed away delicately leaving them all in no doubt that professor trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations 
 
 turn please to the introduction and read what imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation then divide into pairs use the dream oracle to interpret each most recent dreams carry on 
 
 the one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period by the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation at the table next to harry and ron dean had paired up with neville who immediately embarked on a explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his best hat harry and ron merely looked at each other glumly 
 
 i never remember my dreams said ron you say one 
 
 you must remember one of them said harry impatiently 
 
 he was not going to share his dreams with anyone he knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant he did not need ron or proiessor trelawney or the stupid dream oracle to tell him 
 
 well i dreamed i was playing quidditch the other night said ron screwing up his face in an effort to remember what reckon that means 
 
 probably that going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something said harry turning the pages of the dream oracle without interest it was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the oracle and harry was not cheered up when professor trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework when the bell went he and ron led the way back down the ladder ron grumbling loudly 
 
 realise how much homework got already binns set us a essay on giant wars snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones and now got a dream diary from trelawney fred and george wrong about owl year were they that umbridge woman had better not give us any 
 
 when they entered the defence against the dark arts classroom they found professor umbridge already seated at the teachers desk wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad 
 
 the class was quiet as it entered the room professor umbridge was as yet an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be 
 
 well good afternoon she said when finally the whole class had sat down 
 
 a few people mumbled good afternoon in reply 
 
 tut tut said professor umbridge that do now will it i should like you please to reply good afternoon professor umbridge one more time please good afternoon class 
 
 good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted back at her 
 
 there now said professor umbridge sweetly that too difficult was it wands away and quills out please 
 
 many of the class exchanged gloomy looks the order wands away had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill ink and parchment professor umbridge opened her handbag extracted her own wand which was an unusually short one and tapped the blackboard sharply with it words appeared on the board at once 
 
 defence against the dark arts 
 
 a return to basic principles 
 
 well now your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented it stated professor umbridge turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her the constant changing of teachers many of whom do not seem to have followed any curriculum has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your owl year 
 
 you will be pleased to know however that these problems are now to be rectified we will be following a carefully structured course of defensive magic this year copy down the following please 
 
 she rapped the blackboard again the first message vanished and was replaced by 
 
 course aims 
 understanding the principles underlying defensive magic 
 
 learning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally be used 
 
 placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use 
 
 for a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment when everyone had copied down professor three course aims she asked has everybody got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 there was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class 
 
 i think try that again said professor umbridge when i ask you a question i should like you to reply yes professor umbridge or no professor umbridge so has everyone got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 yes professor umbridge rang through the room 
 
 good said professor umbridge i should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one basics for beginners there will be no need to talk 
 
 professor umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the desk observing them all closely with those pouchy eyes harry turned to page five of his copy of defensive magical theory and started to read 
 
 it was desperately dull quite as bad as listening to professor binns he felt his concentration sliding away from him he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words several silent minutes passed next to him ron was turning his quill over and over in his fingers staring at the same spot on the page harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor hermione had not even opened her copy of defensive magical was staring fixedly at professor umbridge with her hand in the air 
 
 harry could not remember hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose he looked at her enquiringly but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions and continued to stare at professor umbridge who was looking just as resolutely in another direction 
 
 after several more minutes had passed however harry was not the only one watching hermione the chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch mute attempt to catch professor eye rather than struggle on with basics for beginners 
 
 when more than half the class were staring at hermione rather than at their books professor umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer 
 
 did you want to ask something about the chapter dear she asked hermione as though she had only just noticed her 
 
 not about the chapter no said hermione 
 
 well reading just now said professor umbridge showing her small pointed teeth if you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class 
 
 got a query about your course aims said hermione 
 
 professor umbridge raised her eyebrows 
 
 and your name is 
 
 hermione granger said hermione 
 
 well miss granger i think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully said professor umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness 
 
 well i said hermione bluntly nothing written up there about using defensive spells 
 
 there was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard 
 
 using defensive spells professor umbridge repeated with a little laugh why i imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell miss granger you surely expecting to be attacked during class 
 
 not going to use magic ron exclaimed loudly 
 
 students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class mr 
 
 weasley said ron thrusting his hand into the air 
 
 professor umbridge smiling still more widely turned her back on him harry and hermione immediately raised their hands too professor pouchy eyes lingered on harry for a moment before she addressed hermione 
 
 yes miss granger you wanted to ask something else 
 
 yes said hermione surely the whole point of defence against the dark arts is to practise defensive spells 
 
 are you a educational expert miss granger asked professor umbridge in her falsely sweet voice 
 
 no but 
 
 well then afraid you are not qualified to decide what the whole point of any class is wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new programme of study you will be learning about defensive spells in a secure way 
 
 what use is that said harry loudly if going to be attacked it be in a 
 
 potter sang professor umbridge 
 
 harry thrust his fist in the air again professor umbridge promptly turned away from him but now several other people had their hands up too 
 
 and your name is professor umbridge said to dean 
 
 dean thomas 
 
 well mr thomas 
 
 well like harry said it said dean if going to be attacked it be risk free 
 
 i repeat said professor umbridge smiling in a very irritating fashion at dean do you expect to be attacked during my classes 
 
 no but 
 
 professor umbridge talked over him i do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school she said an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class very irresponsible indeednot to mention she gave a nasty little laugh extremely dangerous 
 
 if you mean professor lupin piped up dean angrily he was the best we ever 
 
 thomas as i was sayingyou have been introduced to spells that have been complex inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal you have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet dark attacks every other day 
 
 no we hermione said we just 
 
 your hand is not up miss granger 
 
 hermione put up her hand professor umbridge turned away from her 
 
 it is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you he actually performed them on you 
 
 well he turned out to be a maniac he said dean hotly mind you we still learned loads 
 
 your hand is not up mr thomas trilled professor umbridge now it is the view of the ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination which after all is what school is all about and your name is she added staring at parvati whose hand had just shot up 
 
 parvati patil and there a practical bit in our defence against the dark arts owl we supposed to show that we can actually do the and things 
 
 as long as you have studied the theory hard enough there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions said professor umbridge dismissively 
 
 without ever practising them beforehand said parvati incredulously are you telling us that the first time get to do the spells will be during our exam 
 
 i repeat as long as you have studied the theory hard enough 
 
 and what theory going to be in the real world said harry loudly his fist in the air again 
 
 professor umbridge looked up 
 
 this is school mr potter not the real world she said softly 
 
 so not supposed to be prepared for waiting for us out there 
 
 there is nothing waiting out there mr potter 
 
 oh yeah said harry his temper which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day was reaching boiling point 
 
 who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves enquired professor umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice 
 
 hmm think said harry in a mock thoughtful voice maybe lord voldemort 
 
 ron gasped lavender brown uttered a little scream neville slipped sideways off his stool professor umbridge however did not flinch she was staring at harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face 
 
 ten points from gryffindor mr potter 
 
 the classroom was silent and still everyone was staring at either umbridge or harry 
 
 now let me make a few things quite plain 
 
 professor umbridge stood up and leaned towards them her hands splayed on her desk 
 
 you have been told that a certain dark wizard has returned from the dead 
 
 he dead said harry angrily but yeah returned 
 
 said professor umbridge in one breath without looking at him as i was saying you have been informed that a certain dark wizard is at large once again this is a lie 
 
 it is not a lie said harry i saw him i fought him 
 
 detention mr potter said professor umbridge triumphantly tomorrow evening five my office i repeat this is a ministry of magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any dark wizard if you are still worried by all means come and see me outside class hours if someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn dark wizards i would like to hear about it i am here to help i am your friend and now you will kindly continue your reading page five basics for beginners 
 
 professor umbridge sat down behind her desk harry however stood up everyone was staring at him seamus looked 
 
 harry no hermione whispered in a warning voice tugging at his sleeve but harry jerked his arm out of her reach 
 
 so according to you cedric diggory dropped dead of his own accord did he harry asked his voice shaking 
 
 there was a collective intake of breath from the class for none of them apart from ron and hermione had ever heard harry talk about what had happened on the night cedric had died they stared avidly from harry to professor umbridge who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face 
 
 cedric death was a tragic accident she said coldly 
 
 it was murder said harry he could feel himself shaking he had hardly spoken to anyone about this least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates voldemort killed him and you know it 
 
 professor face was quite blank for a moment harry thought she was going to scream at him then she said in her softest most sweetly girlish voice come here mr potter dear 
 
 he kicked his chair aside strode around ron and hermione and up to the desk he could feel the rest of the class holding its breath he felt so angry he did not care what happened next 
 
 professor umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag stretched it out on the desk dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling hunched over so that harry could not see what she was writing nobody spoke after a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it 
 
 take this to professor mcgonagall dear said professor umbridge holding out the note to him 
 
 he took it from her without saying a word turned on his heel and left the room not even looking back at ron and hermione slamming the classroom door shut behind him he walked very fast along the corridor the note to mcgonagall clutched tight in his hand and turning a corner walked slap into peeves the poltergeist a little man floating on his back in midair juggling several inkwells 
 
 why potty wee potter cackled peeves allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl 
 
 get out of it peeves 
 
 oooh feeling cranky said peeves pursuing harry along the corridor leering as he zoomed along above him what is it this time my fine potty friend hearing voices seeing visions speaking in peeves blew a gigantic raspberry tongues 
 
 i said leave me alone harry shouted running down the nearest flight of stairs but peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him 
 
 oh most think barking the potty wee lad 
 
 but some are more kindly and think just sad 
 
 but peevesy knows better and says that mad 
 
 
 
 shut up 
 
 a door to his left flew open and professor mcgonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed 
 
 what on earth are you shouting about potter she snapped as peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight why you in class 
 
 been sent to see you said harry stiffly 
 
 sent what do you mean sent 
 
 he held out the note from professor umbridge professor mcgonagall took it from him frowning slit it open with a tap of her wand stretched it out and began to read her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what umbridge had written and with each line they became narrower 
 
 come in here potter 
 
 he followed her inside her study the door closed automatically behind him 
 
 well said professor mcgonagall rounding on him is this true 
 
 is what true harry asked rather more aggressively than he had intended professor he added in an attempt to sound more polite 
 
 is it true that you shouted at professor umbridge 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you called her a liar 
 
 yes 
 
 you told her he who must not be named is back 
 
 yes 
 
 professor mcgonagall sat down behind her desk watching harry closely then she said have a biscuit potter 
 
 havewhat 
 
 have a biscuit she repeated impatiently indicating a tartan tin lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk and sit down 
 
 there had been a previous occasion when harry expecting to be caned by professor mcgonagall had instead been appointed by her to the gryffindor quidditch team he sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a ginger newt feeling just as confused and as he had done on that occasion 
 
 professor mcgonagall set down professor note and looked very seriously at harry 
 
 potter you need to be careful 
 
 harry swallowed his mouthful of ginger newt and stared at her her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to it was not brisk crisp and stern it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual 
 
 misbehaviour in dolores class could cost you much more than house points and a detention 
 
 what do you 
 
 potter use your common sense snapped professor mcgonagall with an abrupt return to her usual manner you know where she comes from you must know to whom she is reporting 
 
 the bell rang for the end of the lesson overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move 
 
 it says here given you detention every evening this week starting tomorrow professor mcgonagall said looking down at note again 
 
 every evening this week harry repeated horrified but professor you 
 
 no i said professor mcgonagall flatly 
 
 but 
 
 she is your teacher and has every right to give you detention you will go to her room at five tomorrow for the first one just remember tread carefully around dolores umbridge 
 
 but i was telling the truth said harry outraged voldemort is back you know he is professor dumbledore knows he is 
 
 for sake potter said professor mcgonagall straightening her glasses angrily she had winced horribly when he had used name do you really think this is about truth or lies about keeping your head down and your temper under control 
 
 she stood up nostrils wide and mouth very thin and harry stood up too 
 
 have another biscuit she said irritably thrusting the tin at him 
 
 no thanks said harry coldly 
 
 be ridiculous she snapped 
 
 he took one 
 
 thanks he said grudgingly 
 
 you listen to dolores speech at the feast potter 
 
 yeah said harry yeah she said progress will be prohibited or well it meant that that the ministry of magic is trying to interfere at hogwarts 
 
 professor mcgonagall eyed him closely for a moment then sniffed walked around her desk and held open the door for him 
 
 well glad you listen to hermione granger at any rate she said pointing him out of her office 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelve professor umbridgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before harry had even put on his socks 
 
 does he think turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long asked harry loudly as the hem of robes wnipped out of sight 
 
 worry about it harry dean muttered hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder just 
 
 but apparently he was unable to say exactly what seamus was and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room 
 
 neville and ron both gave harry an look but harry was not much consoled how much more of this would he have to take 
 
 the matter asked hermione five minutes later catching up with harry and ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast you look absolutelyoh for heavens sake 
 
 she was staring at the noticeboard where a large new sign had been put up 
 
 gallons of galleons 
 
 pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings 
 
 like to earn a little extra gold 
 
 contact fred and george weasley gryffindor common room 
 
 for simple virtually painless jobs 
 
 we regret that all work is undertaken at own risk 
 
 they are the limit said hermione grimly taking down the sign which fred and george had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first hogsmeade weekend which was to be in october have to talk to them ron 
 
 ron looked positively alarmed 
 
 why 
 
 because prefects said hermione as they climbed out through the portrait hole up to us to stop this kind of thing 
 
 ron said nothing harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping fred and george doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting 
 
 anyway up harry hermione continued as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards all of whom ignored them being engrossed in their own conversation you look really angry about something 
 
 seamus reckons lying about said ron succinctly when harry did not respond 
 
 hermione who harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf sighed 
 
 yes lavender thinks so too she said gloomily 
 
 been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not a lying prat have you harry said loudly 
 
 no said hermione calmly i told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you actually and it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats harry because in case you noticed ron and i are on your side 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 sorry said harry in a low voice 
 
 quite all right said hermione with dignity then she shook her head you remember what dumbledore said at the last feast 
 
 harry and ron both looked at her blankly and hermione sighed again 
 
 about he said his gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust 
 
 how do you remember stuff like that asked ron looking at her in admiration 
 
 i listen ron said hermione with a touch of asperity 
 
 so do i but i still tell you exactly what 
 
 the point hermione pressed on loudly is that this sort of thing is exactly what dumbledore was talking about only been back two months and already started fighting among ourselves and the sorting warning was the same stand together be united 
 
 and harry got it right last night retorted ron if that means supposed to get matey with the slytherinsfat chance 
 
 well i think a pity not trying for a bit of unity said hermione crossly 
 
 they had reached the foot of the marble staircase a line of ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall they caught sight of harry and hurried to form a tighter group as though frightened he might attack stragglers 
 
 yeah we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that said harry sarcastically 
 
 they followed the ravenclaws into the great hall all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered professor was chatting to professor sinistra the astronomy teacher and hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence the enchanted ceiling above them echoed mood it was a miserable grey 
 
 dumbledore even mention how long that staying he said as they made their way across to the gryffindor table 
 
 maybe said hermione thoughtfully 
 
 what said both harry and ron together 
 
 well maybe he want to draw attention to hagrid not being here 
 
 what mean draw attention to it said ron how could we not notice 
 
 before hermione could answer a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to harry 
 
 hi angelina 
 
 hi she said briskly good summer and without waiting for an answer listen been made gryffindor quidditch captain 
 
 nice one said harry grinning at her he suspected pep talks might not be as as oliver had been which could only be an improvement 
 
 yeah well we need a new keeper now left tryouts are on friday at five and i want the whole team there all right then we can see how the new fit in 
 
 ok said harry 
 
 angelina smiled at him and departed 
 
 forgotten wood had left said hermione vaguely as she sat down beside ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her i suppose that will make quite a difference to the team 
 
 i said harry taking the bench opposite he was a good keeper 
 
 still it hurt to have some new blood will it said ron 
 
 with a whoosh and a clatter hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows they descended all over the hall bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water it was clearly raining hard outside hedwig was nowhere to be seen but harry was hardly surprised his only correspondent was sirius and he doubted sirius would have anything new to tell him after only hours apart hermione however had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way gor a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden daily prophet in its beak 
 
 what are you still getting that for said harry irritably thinking of seamus as hermione placed a knut in the leather pouch on the leg and it took off again not bothering load of rubbish 
 
 best to know what the enemy is saying said hermione darkly and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it not emerging until harry and ron had finished eating 
 
 nothing she said simply rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate nothing about you or dumbledore or anything 
 
 professor mcgonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables 
 
 look at today groaned ron history of magic double potions divination and double defence against the dark arts binns snape trelawney and that umbridge woman all in one day i wish fred and hurry up and get those skiving snackboxes sorted 
 
 do mine ears deceive me said fred arriving with george and squeezing on to the bench beside harry hogwarts prefects surely wish to skive off lessons 
 
 look what got today said ron grumpily shoving his timetable under nose the worst monday ever seen 
 
 fair point little bro said fred scanning the column you can have a bit of nosebleed nougat cheap if you like 
 
 it cheap said ron suspiciously 
 
 because keep bleeding till you shrivel up we got an antidote yet said george helping himself to a kipper 
 
 cheers said ron moodily pocketing his timetable but i think take the lessons 
 
 and speaking of your skiving snackboxes said hermione eyeing fred and george beadily you advertise for testers on the gryffindor noticeboard 
 
 says who said george looking astonished 
 
 says me said hermione and ron 
 
 leave me out of it said ron hastily 
 
 hermione glared at him fred and george sniggered 
 
 be singing a different tune soon enough hermione said fred thickly buttering a crumpet starting your fifth year be begging us for a snackbox before long 
 
 and why would starting fifth year mean i want a skiving snackbox asked hermione 
 
 fifth owl year said george 
 
 so 
 
 so got your exams coming up you be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone be rubbed raw said fred with satisfaction 
 
 half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to owls said george happily tears and tantrums patricia stimpson kept coming over faint 
 
 kenneth towler came out in boils remember said fred remmiscently 
 
 cause you put bulbadox powder in his pyjamas said george 
 
 oh yeah said fred grinning forgotten hard to keep track sometimes it 
 
 anyway a nightmare of a year the fifth said george if you care about exam results anyway fred and i managed to keep our peckers up somehow 
 
 yeah you got what was it three owls each said ron 
 
 yep said fred unconcernedly but we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement 
 
 we seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year said george brightly now that got 
 
 he broke off at a warning look from harry who knew george had been about to mention the triwizard winnings he had given them 
 
 now that got our owls george said hastily i mean do we really need newts but we think mum could take us leaving school early not on top of percy turning out to be the biggest prat 
 
 not going to waste our last year here though said fred looking affectionately around at the great hall going to use it to do a bit of market research find out exactly what the average hogwarts student requires from a joke shop carefully evaluate the results of our research then produce products to fit the demand 
 
 but where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop hermione asked sceptically going to need all the ingredients and materialsand premises too i suppose 
 
 harry did not look at the twins his face felt hot he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it he heard fred say overhead ask us no questions and tell you no lies hermione george if we get there early we might be able to sell a few extendable ears before herbology 
 
 harry emerged from under the table to see fred and george walking away each carrying a stack of toast 
 
 what did that mean said hermione looking from harry to ron ask us no questions does that mean already got some gold to start a joke shop 
 
 you know been wondering about that said ron his brow furrowed they bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and i understand where they got the galleons 
 
 harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters 
 
 reckon true this going to be really tough because of the exams 
 
 oh yeah said ron bound to be it owls are really important affect the jobs you can apply for and everything we get career advice too later this year bill told me so you can choose what newts you want to do next year 
 
 know what you want to do after hogwarts harry asked the other two as they left the great hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their history of magic classroom 
 
 not really said ron slowly except well 
 
 he looked slightly sheepish 
 
 what harry urged him 
 
 well be cool to be an auror said ron in an voice 
 
 yeah it would said harry fervently 
 
 but like the elite said ron got to be really good what about you hermione 
 
 i know she said i think like to do something really worthwhile 
 
 an worthwhile said harry 
 
 yes it is but not the only worthwhile thing said hermione thoughtfully i mean if i could take spew further 
 
 harry and ron carefully avoided looking at each other 
 
 history of magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind professor binns their ghost teacher had a wheezy droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes five in warm weather he never varied the form of their lessons but lectured them without pausing while they took notes or rather gazed sleepily into space harry and ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying notes before exams she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of voice 
 
 today they suffered an hour and a droning on the subject of giant wars harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another hands this subject might have been mildly interesting but then his brain disengaged and he spent the remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with ron while hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye 
 
 how would it be she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break binns drifting away through the blackboard if i refused to lend you my notes this year 
 
 fail our owl said ron if you want that on your conscience hermione 
 
 well deserve it she snapped you even try to listen to him do you 
 
 we do try said ron we just got your brains or your memory or your concentration just cleverer than we areis it nice to rub it in 
 
 oh give me that rubbish said hermione but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard 
 
 a fine misty drizzle was falling so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges harry ron and hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly september air and talking about what snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year they had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult just to catch them off guard after a holiday when someone walked around the corner towards them 
 
 hello harry 
 
 it was cho chang and what was more she was on her own again this was most unusual cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the yule ball 
 
 hi said harry feeling his face grow hot at least not covered in stinksap this time he told himself cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines 
 
 you got that stuff off then 
 
 yeah said harry trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying so did you er have a good summer 
 
 the moment he had said this he wished he had been boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected something seemed to tauten in her face but she said oh it was all right you know 
 
 is that a tornados badge ron demanded suddenly pointing to the front of robes where a badge emblazoned with a double gold t was pinned you support them do you 
 
 yeah i do said cho 
 
 have you always supported them or just since they started winning the league said ron in what harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice 
 
 supported them since i was six said cho coolly anyway see you harry 
 
 she walked away hermione waited until cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on ron 
 
 you are so tactless 
 
 what i only asked her if 
 
 you tell she wanted to talk to harry on her own 
 
 so she done i stopping 
 
 why on earth were you attacking her about her quidditch team 
 
 attacking i attacking her i was only 
 
 who cares if she supports the tornados 
 
 oh come on half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season 
 
 but what does it matter 
 
 it means not real fans just jumping on the bandwagon 
 
 the bell said harry dully because ron and hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it they did not stop arguing all the way down to snapes dungeon which gave harry plenty of time to reflect that between neville and ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country 
 
 and yet he thought as they joined the queue lining up outside classroom door she had chosen to come and talk to him she she had been girlfriend she could easily have hated harry for coming out of the triwizard maze alive when cedric had died yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way not as though she thought him mad or a liar or in some horrible way responsible for death yes she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him and that made the second time in two days and at this thought spirits rose even the ominous sound of dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest he filed into the classroom behind ron and hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back where he sat down between ron and hermione and ignored the huffy irritable noises now issuing from both of them 
 
 settle down said snape coldly shutting the door behind him 
 
 there was no real need for the call to order the moment the class had heard the door close quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped mere presence was usually enough to ensure a silence 
 
 before we begin lesson said snape sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all i think it appropriate to remind you that next june you will be sitting an important examination during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are i expect you to scrape an acceptable in your owl or suffer my displeasure 
 
 his gaze lingered this time on neville who gulped 
 
 after this year of course many of you will cease studying with me snape went on i take only the very best into my newt potions class which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye 
 
 his eyes rested on harry and his lip curled harry glared back feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up potions after fifth year 
 
 but we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell said snape softly so whether or not you are intending to attempt newt i advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level i have come to expect from my owl students 
 
 today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at ordinary wizarding level the draught of peace a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation be warned if you are too with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing on left hermione sat up a little straighter her expression one of utmost attention the ingredients and method snape flicked his wand are on the appeared there you will find everything you need he flicked his wand again in the store cupboard the door of the said cupboard sprang open you have an hour and a half start 
 
 just as harry ron and hermione had predicted snape could hardly have set them a more difficult fiddly potion the ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times firstly in clockwise then in directions the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added 
 
 a light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion called snape with ten minutes left to go 
 
 harry who was sweating profusely looked desperately around the dungeon his own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam was spitting green sparks seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand as they seemed to be going out the surface of potion however was a shimmering mist of silver vapour and as snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment which meant he could find nothing to criticise 
 
 at cauldron however snape stopped and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his face 
 
 potter what is this supposed to be 
 
 the slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly they loved hearing snape taunt harry 
 
 the draught of peace said harry tensely 
 
 tell me potter said snape softly can you read 
 
 draco malfoy laughed 
 
 yes i can said harry his fingers clenched tightly around his wand 
 
 read the third line of the instructions for me potter 
 
 harry squinted at the blackboard it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of steam now filling the dungeon 
 
 add powdered moonstone stir three times allow to simmer for seven minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore 
 
 his heart sank he had not added syrup of hellebore but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes 
 
 did you do everything on the third line potter 
 
 no said harry very quietly 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 no said harry more loudly i forgot the hellebore 
 
 i know you did potter which means that this mess is utterly worthless evanesce 
 
 the contents of potion vanished he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron 
 
 those of you who have managed to read the instructions fill one flagon with a sample of your potion label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing said snape homework twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in to be handed in on thursday 
 
 while everyone around him filled their flagons harry cleared away his things seething his potion had been no worse than which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs or which had achieved the consistency of cement and which neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron yet it was he harry who would be receiving zero marks for the work he stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat watching everyone else march up to desk with filled and corked flagons when at long last the bell rang harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time ron and hermione joined him in the great hall the ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning rain was lashing the high windows 
 
 that was really unfair said hermione consolingly sitting down next to harry and helping herself to pie your potion nearly as bad as when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire 
 
 yeah well said harry glowering at his plate since when has snape ever been fair to me 
 
 neither of the others answered all three of them knew that snape and mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment harry had set foot in hogwarts 
 
 i did think he might be a bit better this year said hermione in a disappointed voice i mean you know she looked around carefully there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table now in the order and everything 
 
 poisonous toadstools change their spots said ron sagely anyway always thought dumbledore was cracked to trust snape the evidence he ever really stopped working for 
 
 i think probably got plenty of evidence even if he share it with you ron snapped hermione 
 
 oh shut up the pair of you said harry heavily as ron opened his mouth to argue back hermione and ron both froze looking angry and offended you give it a rest said harry always having a go at each other driving me mad and abandoning his pie he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there 
 
 he walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time past the many students hurrying towards lunch the anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him and the vision of ron and shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction serve them right he thought why they give it a rest bickering all the time enough to drive anyone up the wall 
 
 he passed the large picture of sir cadogan the knight on a landing sir cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at harry who ignored him 
 
 come back you scurvy dog stand fast and fight yelled sir cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor but harry merely walked on and when sir cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighbouring picture he was rebuffed by its inhabitant a large and wolfhound 
 
 harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of north tower consequently he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to sybill classroom when the bell rang 
 
 after potions divination was least favourite class which was due mainly to professor habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons a thin woman heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads she always reminded harry of some kind of insect with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes she was busy putting copies of battered books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when harry entered the room but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows the rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes ron emerged from the trapdoor looked around carefully spotted harry and made directly for him or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables chairs and overstuffed pouffes 
 
 hermione and me have stopped arguing he said sitting down beside harry 
 
 good grunted harry 
 
 but hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us said ron 
 
 i m not 
 
 just passing on the message said ron talking over him but i reckon right not our fault how seamus and snape treat you 
 
 i never said it 
 
 said professor trelawney in her usual misty dreamy voice and harry broke off again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself and welcome back to divination i have of course been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays and am delighted to see that you have all returned to hogwarts safelyas of course i knew you would 
 
 you will find on the tables before you copies of the dream oracle by inigo imago dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your owl not of course that i believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination if you have the seeing eye certificates and grades matter very little however the headmaster likes you to sit the examination so 
 
 her voice trailed away delicately leaving them all in no doubt that professor trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations 
 
 turn please to the introduction and read what imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation then divide into pairs use the dream oracle to interpret each most recent dreams carry on 
 
 the one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period by the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation at the table next to harry and ron dean had paired up with neville who immediately embarked on a explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his best hat harry and ron merely looked at each other glumly 
 
 i never remember my dreams said ron you say one 
 
 you must remember one of them said harry impatiently 
 
 he was not going to share his dreams with anyone he knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant he did not need ron or proiessor trelawney or the stupid dream oracle to tell him 
 
 well i dreamed i was playing quidditch the other night said ron screwing up his face in an effort to remember what reckon that means 
 
 probably that going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something said harry turning the pages of the dream oracle without interest it was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the oracle and harry was not cheered up when professor trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework when the bell went he and ron led the way back down the ladder ron grumbling loudly 
 
 realise how much homework got already binns set us a essay on giant wars snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones and now got a dream diary from trelawney fred and george wrong about owl year were they that umbridge woman had better not give us any 
 
 when they entered the defence against the dark arts classroom they found professor umbridge already seated at the teachers desk wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad 
 
 the class was quiet as it entered the room professor umbridge was as yet an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be 
 
 well good afternoon she said when finally the whole class had sat down 
 
 a few people mumbled good afternoon in reply 
 
 tut tut said professor umbridge that do now will it i should like you please to reply good afternoon professor umbridge one more time please good afternoon class 
 
 good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted back at her 
 
 there now said professor umbridge sweetly that too difficult was it wands away and quills out please 
 
 many of the class exchanged gloomy looks the order wands away had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill ink and parchment professor umbridge opened her handbag extracted her own wand which was an unusually short one and tapped the blackboard sharply with it words appeared on the board at once 
 
 defence against the dark arts 
 
 a return to basic principles 
 
 well now your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented it stated professor umbridge turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her the constant changing of teachers many of whom do not seem to have followed any curriculum has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your owl year 
 
 you will be pleased to know however that these problems are now to be rectified we will be following a carefully structured course of defensive magic this year copy down the following please 
 
 she rapped the blackboard again the first message vanished and was replaced by 
 
 course aims 
 understanding the principles underlying defensive magic 
 
 learning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally be used 
 
 placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use 
 
 for a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment when everyone had copied down professor three course aims she asked has everybody got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 there was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class 
 
 i think try that again said professor umbridge when i ask you a question i should like you to reply yes professor umbridge or no professor umbridge so has everyone got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 yes professor umbridge rang through the room 
 
 good said professor umbridge i should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one basics for beginners there will be no need to talk 
 
 professor umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the desk observing them all closely with those pouchy eyes harry turned to page five of his copy of defensive magical theory and started to read 
 
 it was desperately dull quite as bad as listening to professor binns he felt his concentration sliding away from him he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words several silent minutes passed next to him ron was turning his quill over and over in his fingers staring at the same spot on the page harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor hermione had not even opened her copy of defensive magical was staring fixedly at professor umbridge with her hand in the air 
 
 harry could not remember hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose he looked at her enquiringly but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions and continued to stare at professor umbridge who was looking just as resolutely in another direction 
 
 after several more minutes had passed however harry was not the only one watching hermione the chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch mute attempt to catch professor eye rather than struggle on with basics for beginners 
 
 when more than half the class were staring at hermione rather than at their books professor umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer 
 
 did you want to ask something about the chapter dear she asked hermione as though she had only just noticed her 
 
 not about the chapter no said hermione 
 
 well reading just now said professor umbridge showing her small pointed teeth if you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class 
 
 got a query about your course aims said hermione 
 
 professor umbridge raised her eyebrows 
 
 and your name is 
 
 hermione granger said hermione 
 
 well miss granger i think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully said professor umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness 
 
 well i said hermione bluntly nothing written up there about using defensive spells 
 
 there was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard 
 
 using defensive spells professor umbridge repeated with a little laugh why i imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell miss granger you surely expecting to be attacked during class 
 
 not going to use magic ron exclaimed loudly 
 
 students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class mr 
 
 weasley said ron thrusting his hand into the air 
 
 professor umbridge smiling still more widely turned her back on him harry and hermione immediately raised their hands too professor pouchy eyes lingered on harry for a moment before she addressed hermione 
 
 yes miss granger you wanted to ask something else 
 
 yes said hermione surely the whole point of defence against the dark arts is to practise defensive spells 
 
 are you a educational expert miss granger asked professor umbridge in her falsely sweet voice 
 
 no but 
 
 well then afraid you are not qualified to decide what the whole point of any class is wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new programme of study you will be learning about defensive spells in a secure way 
 
 what use is that said harry loudly if going to be attacked it be in a 
 
 potter sang professor umbridge 
 
 harry thrust his fist in the air again professor umbridge promptly turned away from him but now several other people had their hands up too 
 
 and your name is professor umbridge said to dean 
 
 dean thomas 
 
 well mr thomas 
 
 well like harry said it said dean if going to be attacked it be risk free 
 
 i repeat said professor umbridge smiling in a very irritating fashion at dean do you expect to be attacked during my classes 
 
 no but 
 
 professor umbridge talked over him i do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school she said an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class very irresponsible indeednot to mention she gave a nasty little laugh extremely dangerous 
 
 if you mean professor lupin piped up dean angrily he was the best we ever 
 
 thomas as i was sayingyou have been introduced to spells that have been complex inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal you have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet dark attacks every other day 
 
 no we hermione said we just 
 
 your hand is not up miss granger 
 
 hermione put up her hand professor umbridge turned away from her 
 
 it is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you he actually performed them on you 
 
 well he turned out to be a maniac he said dean hotly mind you we still learned loads 
 
 your hand is not up mr thomas trilled professor umbridge now it is the view of the ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination which after all is what school is all about and your name is she added staring at parvati whose hand had just shot up 
 
 parvati patil and there a practical bit in our defence against the dark arts owl we supposed to show that we can actually do the and things 
 
 as long as you have studied the theory hard enough there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions said professor umbridge dismissively 
 
 without ever practising them beforehand said parvati incredulously are you telling us that the first time get to do the spells will be during our exam 
 
 i repeat as long as you have studied the theory hard enough 
 
 and what theory going to be in the real world said harry loudly his fist in the air again 
 
 professor umbridge looked up 
 
 this is school mr potter not the real world she said softly 
 
 so not supposed to be prepared for waiting for us out there 
 
 there is nothing waiting out there mr potter 
 
 oh yeah said harry his temper which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day was reaching boiling point 
 
 who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves enquired professor umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice 
 
 hmm think said harry in a mock thoughtful voice maybe lord voldemort 
 
 ron gasped lavender brown uttered a little scream neville slipped sideways off his stool professor umbridge however did not flinch she was staring at harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face 
 
 ten points from gryffindor mr potter 
 
 the classroom was silent and still everyone was staring at either umbridge or harry 
 
 now let me make a few things quite plain 
 
 professor umbridge stood up and leaned towards them her hands splayed on her desk 
 
 you have been told that a certain dark wizard has returned from the dead 
 
 he dead said harry angrily but yeah returned 
 
 said professor umbridge in one breath without looking at him as i was saying you have been informed that a certain dark wizard is at large once again this is a lie 
 
 it is not a lie said harry i saw him i fought him 
 
 detention mr potter said professor umbridge triumphantly tomorrow evening five my office i repeat this is a ministry of magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any dark wizard if you are still worried by all means come and see me outside class hours if someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn dark wizards i would like to hear about it i am here to help i am your friend and now you will kindly continue your reading page five basics for beginners 
 
 professor umbridge sat down behind her desk harry however stood up everyone was staring at him seamus looked 
 
 harry no hermione whispered in a warning voice tugging at his sleeve but harry jerked his arm out of her reach 
 
 so according to you cedric diggory dropped dead of his own accord did he harry asked his voice shaking 
 
 there was a collective intake of breath from the class for none of them apart from ron and hermione had ever heard harry talk about what had happened on the night cedric had died they stared avidly from harry to professor umbridge who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face 
 
 cedric death was a tragic accident she said coldly 
 
 it was murder said harry he could feel himself shaking he had hardly spoken to anyone about this least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates voldemort killed him and you know it 
 
 professor face was quite blank for a moment harry thought she was going to scream at him then she said in her softest most sweetly girlish voice come here mr potter dear 
 
 he kicked his chair aside strode around ron and hermione and up to the desk he could feel the rest of the class holding its breath he felt so angry he did not care what happened next 
 
 professor umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag stretched it out on the desk dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling hunched over so that harry could not see what she was writing nobody spoke after a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it 
 
 take this to professor mcgonagall dear said professor umbridge holding out the note to him 
 
 he took it from her without saying a word turned on his heel and left the room not even looking back at ron and hermione slamming the classroom door shut behind him he walked very fast along the corridor the note to mcgonagall clutched tight in his hand and turning a corner walked slap into peeves the poltergeist a little man floating on his back in midair juggling several inkwells 
 
 why potty wee potter cackled peeves allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl 
 
 get out of it peeves 
 
 oooh feeling cranky said peeves pursuing harry along the corridor leering as he zoomed along above him what is it this time my fine potty friend hearing voices seeing visions speaking in peeves blew a gigantic raspberry tongues 
 
 i said leave me alone harry shouted running down the nearest flight of stairs but peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him 
 
 oh most think barking the potty wee lad 
 
 but some are more kindly and think just sad 
 
 but peevesy knows better and says that mad 
 
 
 
 shut up 
 
 a door to his left flew open and professor mcgonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed 
 
 what on earth are you shouting about potter she snapped as peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight why you in class 
 
 been sent to see you said harry stiffly 
 
 sent what do you mean sent 
 
 he held out the note from professor umbridge professor mcgonagall took it from him frowning slit it open with a tap of her wand stretched it out and began to read her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what umbridge had written and with each line they became narrower 
 
 come in here potter 
 
 he followed her inside her study the door closed automatically behind him 
 
 well said professor mcgonagall rounding on him is this true 
 
 is what true harry asked rather more aggressively than he had intended professor he added in an attempt to sound more polite 
 
 is it true that you shouted at professor umbridge 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you called her a liar 
 
 yes 
 
 you told her he who must not be named is back 
 
 yes 
 
 professor mcgonagall sat down behind her desk watching harry closely then she said have a biscuit potter 
 
 havewhat 
 
 have a biscuit she repeated impatiently indicating a tartan tin lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk and sit down 
 
 there had been a previous occasion when harry expecting to be caned by professor mcgonagall had instead been appointed by her to the gryffindor quidditch team he sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a ginger newt feeling just as confused and as he had done on that occasion 
 
 professor mcgonagall set down professor note and looked very seriously at harry 
 
 potter you need to be careful 
 
 harry swallowed his mouthful of ginger newt and stared at her her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to it was not brisk crisp and stern it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual 
 
 misbehaviour in dolores class could cost you much more than house points and a detention 
 
 what do you 
 
 potter use your common sense snapped professor mcgonagall with an abrupt return to her usual manner you know where she comes from you must know to whom she is reporting 
 
 the bell rang for the end of the lesson overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move 
 
 it says here given you detention every evening this week starting tomorrow professor mcgonagall said looking down at note again 
 
 every evening this week harry repeated horrified but professor you 
 
 no i said professor mcgonagall flatly 
 
 but 
 
 she is your teacher and has every right to give you detention you will go to her room at five tomorrow for the first one just remember tread carefully around dolores umbridge 
 
 but i was telling the truth said harry outraged voldemort is back you know he is professor dumbledore knows he is 
 
 for sake potter said professor mcgonagall straightening her glasses angrily she had winced horribly when he had used name do you really think this is about truth or lies about keeping your head down and your temper under control 
 
 she stood up nostrils wide and mouth very thin and harry stood up too 
 
 have another biscuit she said irritably thrusting the tin at him 
 
 no thanks said harry coldly 
 
 be ridiculous she snapped 
 
 he took one 
 
 thanks he said grudgingly 
 
 you listen to dolores speech at the feast potter 
 
 yeah said harry yeah she said progress will be prohibited or well it meant that that the ministry of magic is trying to interfere at hogwarts 
 
 professor mcgonagall eyed him closely for a moment then sniffed walked around her desk and held open the door for him 
 
 well glad you listen to hermione granger at any rate she said pointing him out of her office

lionfish nov chapter twelve silver and opalscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 where was dumbledore and what was he doing harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks he rarely appeared at meals anymore and harry was sure hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time had dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving harry dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy harry had felt bolstered comforted and now he felt slightly abandoned 
 
 halfway through october came their first trip of the term to hogsmeade harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed given the increasingly tight security measures around the school but was pleased to know that they were going ahead it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours 
 
 harry woke early on the morning of the trip which was proving stormy and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of advanced he did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks that sort of behavior as ron rightly said was indecent in anybody except hermione who was simply weird that way harry felt however that the copy of advanced hardly qualified as a textbook the more harry pored over the book the more he realized how much was in there not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a glowing reputation with slughorn but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins which harry was sure judging by the and revisions that the prince had invented himself 
 
 harry had already attempted a few of the spells there had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast he had tried this on crabbe in the corridor with very entertaining results a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth which he had twice used to general applause on an unsuspecting argus filch and perhaps most useful of all muffliato a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard the only person who did not find these charms amusing was hermione who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if harry had used the muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity 
 
 sitting up in bed harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the prince some trouble there were many and alterations but finally crammed into a corner of the page the scribble 
 
 levicorpus 
 
 while the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows and neville snored loudly harry stared at the letters in brackets that had to mean harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell he was still having difficulty with spells something snape had been quick to comment on in every class on the other hand the prince had proved a much more effective teacher than snape so far 
 
 pointing his wand at nothing in particular he gave it an upward flick and said levicorpus inside his head 
 
 aaaaaaaargh 
 
 there was a flash of light and the room was full of voices everyone had woken up as ron had let out a yell harry sent advanced flying in panic ron was dangling in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle 
 
 sorry yelled harry as dean and seamus roared with laughter and neville picked himself up from the floor having fallen out of bed hang let you down 
 
 he groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered the cramped word underneath the spell praying that this was the harry thought liberacorpus with all his might there was another flash of light and ron fell in a heap onto his mattress 
 
 sorry repeated harry weakly while dean and seamus continued to roar with laughter 
 
 tomorrow said ron in a muffled voice rather you set the alarm clock 
 
 by the time they had got dressed padding themselves out with several of mrs sweaters and carrying cloaks scarves and gloves shock had subsided and he had decided that new spell was highly amusing so amusing in fact that he lost no time in regaling hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast 
 
 and then there was another flash of light and i landed on the bed again ron grinned helping himself to sausages 
 
 hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon harry 
 
 was this spell by any chance another one from that potion book of yours she asked 
 
 harry frowned at her 
 
 always jump to the worst conclusion you 
 
 was it 
 
 well yeah it was but so what 
 
 so you just decided to try out an unknown handwritten incantation and see what would happen 
 
 why does it matter if handwritten said harry preferring not to answer the rest of the question 
 
 because probably not ministry of magic approved said hermione and also she added as harry and ron rolled their eyes because starting to think this prince character was a bit dodgy 
 
 both harry and ron shouted her down at once 
 
 it was a laugh said ron upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages just a laugh hermione all 
 
 dangling people upside down by the ankle said hermione who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that 
 
 fred and george said ron shrugging their kind of thing and er 
 
 my dad said harry he had only just remembered 
 
 what said ron and hermione together 
 
 my dad used this spell said harry ilupin told me 
 
 this last part was not true in fact harry had seen his father use the spell on snape but he had never told ron and hermione about that particular excursion into the pensieve now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him could the prince possibly be 
 
 maybe your dad did use it harry said hermione but not the only one seen a whole bunch of people use it in case forgotten dangling people in the air making them float along asleep helpless 
 
 harry stared at her with a sinking feeling he too remembered the behavior of the death eaters at the quidditch world cup ron came to his aid 
 
 that was different he said robustly they were abusing it harry and his dad were just having a laugh you like the prince hermione he added pointing a sausage at her sternly because better than you at potions 
 
 got nothing to do with that said hermione her cheeks reddening i just think very irresponsible to start performing spells when you even know what for and stop talking about the prince as if his title i bet just a stupid nickname and it seem as though he was a very nice person to me 
 
 i see where you get that from said harry heatedly if been a budding death eater he have been boasting about being would he 
 
 even as he said it harry remembered that his father had been but he pushed the thought out of his mind he would worry about that later 
 
 the death eaters all be there enough wizards left said hermione stubbornly i expect most of them are pretending to be pure only they hate be quite happy to let you and ron join up 
 
 there is no way let me be a death eater said ron indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at hermione and hitting ernie macmillan on the head my whole family are blood traitors as bad as to death eaters 
 
 and love to have me said harry sarcastically be best pals if they keep trying to do me in 
 
 this made ron laugh even hermione gave a grudging smile and a distraction arrived in the shape of ginny 
 
 hey harry supposed to give you this 
 
 it was a scroll of parchment with name written upon it in familiar thin slanting writing 
 
 thanks ginny next lesson harry told ron and hermione pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents monday evening he felt suddenly light and happy want to join us in hogsmeade ginny he asked 
 
 going with deanmight see you there she replied waving at them as she left 
 
 filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual checking off the names of people who had permission to go into hogsmeade the process took even longer than normal as filch was everybody with his secrecy sensor 
 
 what does it matter if smuggling dark stuff out demanded ron eyeing the long thin secrecy sensor with apprehension surely you ought to be checking what we bring back in 
 
 his cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the sensor and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet 
 
 the walk into hogsmeade was not enjoyable harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb the road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind more than once harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room and when they finally reached hogsmeade and saw that joke shop had been boarded up harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun ron pointed with a thickly gloved hand toward honeydukes which was mercifully open and harry and hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop 
 
 thank god shivered ron as they were enveloped by warm air stay here all afternoon 
 
 harry said a booming voice from behind them 
 
 oh no muttered harry the three of them turned to see professor slughorn who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop 
 
 harry three of my little suppers missed now said slughorn poking him genially in the chest it do determined to have you miss granger loves them you 
 
 yes said hermione helplessly really 
 
 so why you come along harry demanded slughorn 
 
 well had quidditch practice professor said harry who had indeed been scheduling practices every time slughorn had sent him a little violet invitation this strategy meant that ron was not left out and they usually had a laugh with ginny imagining hermione shut up with mclaggen and zabini 
 
 well i certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work said slughorn but a little recreation never hurt any body now how about monday night you possibly want to practice in this weather 
 
 i professor got eran appointment with professor dumbledore that evening 
 
 unlucky again cried slughorn dramatically ah well you evade me forever harry 
 
 and with a regal wave he waddled out of the shop taking as little notice of ron as though he had been a display of cockroach clusters 
 
 i believe wriggled out of another one said hermione shaking her head not that bad you know even quite fun sometimes but then she caught sight of expression oh got deluxe sugar quillsthose would last hours 
 
 glad that hermione had changed the subject harry showed much more interest in the new sugar quills than he would normally have done but ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when hermione asked him where he wanted to go next 
 
 go to the three broomsticks said harry be warm 
 
 they bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop the bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of honeydukes the street was not very busy nobody was lingering to chat just hurrying toward their destinations the exceptions were two men a little ahead of them standing just outside the three broomsticks one was very tall and thin squinting through his glasses harry recognized the barman who worked in the other hogsmeade pub the head as harry ron and hermione drew closer the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms they were barely feet from him when harry realized who the man was 
 
 mundungus 
 
 the squat man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase which burst open releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window 
 
 oh ello arry said mundungus fletcher with a most unconvincing stab at airiness well let me keep ya 
 
 and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone 
 
 are you selling this stuff asked harry watching mundungus grab an assortment of objects from the ground 
 
 oh well gotta scrape a living said mundungus gimme that 
 
 ron had stooped down and picked up something silver 
 
 hang on ron said slowly this looks familiar 
 
 thank you said mundungus snatching the goblet out of hand and stuffing it back into the case well see you allouch 
 
 harry had pinned mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat holding him fast with one hand he pulled out his wand 
 
 harry squealed hermione 
 
 you took that from house said harry who was almost nose to nose with mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits that had the black family crest on it 
 
 inowhat spluttered mundungus who was slowly turning purple 
 
 what did you do go back the night he died and strip the place snarled harry 
 
 ino 
 
 give it to me 
 
 harry you shrieked hermione as mundungus started to turn blue 
 
 there was a bang and harry felt his hands fly off throat gasping and spluttering mundungus seized his fallen case thencrack he disapparated 
 
 harry swore at the top of his voice spinning on the spot to see where mundungus had gone 
 
 come back you thieving 
 
 no point harry tonks had appeared out of nowhere her mousy hair wet with sleet 
 
 mundungus will probably be in london by now no point yelling 
 
 nicked stuff nicked it 
 
 yes but still said tonks who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information you should get out of the cold 
 
 she watched them go through the door of the three broomsticks the moment he was inside harry burst out he was nicking stuff 
 
 i know harry but please shout people are staring whispered hermione go and sit down get you a drink 
 
 harry was still fuming when hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer 
 
 the order control mundungus harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper they at least stop him stealing everything not fixed down when at headquarters 
 
 shh said hermione desperately looking around to make sure nobody was listening there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at harry with great interest and zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away harry be annoyed too i know your things stealing 
 
 harry gagged on his butterbeer he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 yeah my stuff he said no wonder he pleased to see me well going to tell dumbledore going on the only one who scares mundungus 
 
 good idea whispered hermione clearly pleased that harry was calming down ron what are you staring at 
 
 nothing said ron hastily looking away from the bar but harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid madam rosmerta for whom he had long nursed a soft spot 
 
 i expect in the back getting more firewhisky said hermione waspishly 
 
 ron ignored this jibe sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence harry was thinking about sirius and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway hermione drummed her fingers on the table her eyes flickering between ron and the bar the moment harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said shall we call it a day and go back to school then 
 
 the other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them rearranged their scarves pulled on their gloves then followed katie bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the high street thoughts strayed to ginny as they trudged up the road to hogwarts through the frozen slush they had not met up with her undoubtedly thought harry because she and dean were cozily closeted in madam tea shop that haunt of happy couples scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on 
 
 it was a little while before harry became aware that the voices of katie bell and her friend which were being carried back to him on the wind had become shriller and louder harry squinted at their indistinct figures the two girls were having an argument about something katie was holding in her hand 
 
 nothing to do with you leanne harry heard katie say 
 
 they rounded a corner in the lane sleet coming thick and fast blurring glasses just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them leanne made to grab hold of the package katie was holding katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground 
 
 at once katie rose into the air not as ron had done suspended comically by the ankle but gracefully her arms outstretched as though she was about to fly yet there was something wrong something eerie her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression harry ron hermione and leanne had all halted in their tracks watching 
 
 then six feet above the ground katie let out a terrible scream her eyes flew open but whatever she could see or whatever she was feeling was clearly causing her terrible anguish she screamed and screamed leanne started to scream too and seized ankles trying to tug her back to the ground harry ron and hermione rushed forward to help but even as they grabbed legs she fell on top of them harry and ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them 
 
 harry looked around the landscape seemed deserted 
 
 stay there he shouted at the others over the howling wind going for help 
 
 he began to sprint toward the school he had never seen anyone behave as katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs 
 
 hagrid he panted disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen 
 
 harry said hagrid who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard and was wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat jus bin visitin grawp comin on so well yeh wouldn 
 
 hagrid hurt back there or cursed or something 
 
 wha said hagrid bending lower to hear what harry was saying over the raging wind 
 
 been cursed bellowed harry 
 
 cursed bin cursednot ron hermione 
 
 no not them katie bellthis way 
 
 together they ran back along the lane it took them no time to find the little group of people around katie who was still writhing and screaming on the ground ron hermione and leanne were all trying to quiet her 
 
 get back shouted hagrid lemme see her 
 
 happened to her sobbed leanne i know what 
 
 hagrid stared at katie for a second then without a word bent down scooped her into his arms and ran off toward the castle with her within seconds piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind 
 
 hermione hurried over to wailing friend and put an arm around her 
 
 leanne it 
 
 the girl nodded 
 
 did it just happen all of a sudden or 
 
 it was when that package tore sobbed leanne pointing at the now sodden package on the ground which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter ron bent down his hand outstretched but harry seized his arm and pulled him back 
 
 touch it 
 
 he crouched down an ornate opal necklace was visible poking out of the paper 
 
 seen that before said harry staring at the thing it was on display in borgin and burkes ages ago the label said it was cursed katie must have touched it he looked up at leanne who had started to shake uncontrollably how did katie get hold of this 
 
 well why we were arguing she came back from the bathroom in the three broomsticks holding it said it was a surprise for somebody at hogwarts and she had to deliver it she looked all funny when she said it oh no oh no i bet been imperiused and i realize 
 
 leanne shook with renewed sobs hermione patted her shoulder gently 
 
 she say given it to her leanne 
 
 no she tell me and i said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school but she just listen and and then i tried to grab it from her and and 
 
 leanne let out a wail of despair 
 
 better get up to school said hermione her arm still around leanne be able to find out how she is come on 
 
 harry hesitated for a moment then pulled his scarf from around his face and ignoring gasp carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up 
 
 need to show this to madam pomfrey he said 
 
 as they followed hermione and leanne up the road harry was thinking furiously they had just entered the grounds when he spoke unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer 
 
 malfoy knows about this necklace it was in a case at borgin and burkes four years ago i saw him having a good look at it while i was hiding from him and his dad this is what he was buying that day when we followed him he remembered it and he went back for it 
 
 ii dunno harry said ron hesitantly loads of people go to borgin and burke and that girl say katie got it in the girls bathroom 
 
 she said she came back from the bathroom with it she necessarily get it in the bathroom itself 
 
 mcgonagall said ron warningly 
 
 harry looked up sure enough professor mcgonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them 
 
 hagrid says you four saw what happened to katie bellupstairs to my office at once please that holding potter 
 
 the thing she touched said harry 
 
 good lord said professor mcgonagall looking alarmed as she took the necklace from harry no no filch with me she added hastily as filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his secrecy sensor aloft take this necklace to professor snape at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf 
 
 harry and the others followed professor mcgonagall upstairs and into her office the windows were rattling in their frames and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate professor mcgonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face harry ron hermione and the still sobbing leanne 
 
 well she said sharply what happened 
 
 haltingly and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying leanne told professor mcgonagall how katie had gone to the bathroom in the three broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package how katie had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel which tore open at this point leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her 
 
 all right said professor mcgonagall not unkindly go up to the hospital wing please leanne and get madam pomfrey to give you something for shock 
 
 when she had left the room professor mcgonagall turned back to harry ron and hermione 
 
 what happened when katie touched the necklace 
 
 she rose up in the air said harry before either ron or hermione could speak and then began to scream and collapsed professor can i see professor dumbledore please 
 
 the headmaster is away until monday potter said professor mcgonagall looking surprised 
 
 away harry repeated angrily 
 
 yes potter away said professor mcgonagall tartly but anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me sure 
 
 for a split second harry hesitated professor mcgonagall did not invite confidences dumbledore though in many ways more intimidating still seemed less likely to scorn a theory however wild this was a matter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at 
 
 i think draco malfoy gave katie that necklace professor 
 
 on one side of him ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment on the other hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and harry 
 
 that is a very serious accusation potter said professor mcgonagall after a shocked pause do you have any proof 
 
 no said harry but and he told her about following malfoy to borgin and burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and mr borgin 
 
 when he had finished speaking professor mcgonagall looked slightly confused 
 
 malfoy took something to borgin and burkes for repair 
 
 no professor he just wanted borgin to tell him how to mend something he have it with him but not the point the thing is that he bought something at the same time and i think it was that necklace 
 
 you saw malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package 
 
 no professor he told borgin to keep it in the shop for him 
 
 but harry hermione interrupted borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and malfoy said no 
 
 because he want to touch it obviously said harry angrily 
 
 what he actually said was how would i look carrying that down the street said hermione 
 
 well he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace interjected ron 
 
 oh ron said hermione despairingly it would be all wrapped up so he have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would see it i think whatever he reserved at borgin and burkes was noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the streetand in any case she pressed on loudly before harry could interrupt i asked borgin about the necklace you remember when i went in to try and find out what malfoy had asked him to keep i saw it there and borgin just told me the price he say it was already sold or anything 
 
 well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five seconds of course he going to tell youanyway malfoy sent off for it since 
 
 enough said professor mcgonagall as hermione opened her mouth to retort looking furious potter i appreciate you telling me this but we cannot point the finger of blame at mr malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased the same is probably true of hundreds of people 
 
 what i said muttered ron 
 
 and in any case we have put stringent security measures in place this year i do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge 
 
 but 
 
 and what is more said professor mcgonagall with an air of awful finality mr malfoy was not in hogsmeade today 
 
 harry gaped at her deflating 
 
 how do you know professor 
 
 because he was doing detention with me he has now failed to complete his transfiguration homework twice in a row so thank you for telling me your suspicions potter she said as she marched past them but i need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on katie bell good day to you all 
 
 she held open her office door they had no choice but to file past her without another word 
 
 harry was angry with the other two for siding with mcgonagall nevertheless he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened 
 
 so who do you reckon katie was supposed to give the necklace to asked ron as they climbed the stairs to the common room 
 
 goodness only knows said hermione but whoever it was has had a narrow escape no one could have opened that package without touching the necklace 
 
 it been meant for loads of people said harry dumbledorethe death eaters would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top targets or slughorn dumbledore reckons voldemort really wanted him and they be pleased that sided with dumbledore or 
 
 or you said hermione looking troubled 
 
 have been said harry or katie just turned around in the lane and given it to me she i was behind her all the way out of the three broomsticks it would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside hogwarts what with filch searching everyone who goes in and out i wonder why malfoy told her to take it into the castle 
 
 harry malfoy in hogsmeade said hermione actually stamping her foot in frustration 
 
 he must have used an accomplice then said harry crabbe or goyleor come to think of it another death eater have loads better cronies than crabbe and goyle now joined up 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged looks that plainly said no point arguing with him 
 
 dilligrout said hermione firmly as they reached the fat lady 
 
 the portrait swung open to admit them to the common room it was quite full and smelled of damp clothing many people seemed to have returned from hogsmeade early because of the bad weather there was no buzz of fear or speculation however clearly the news of fate had not yet spread 
 
 it a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it said ron casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down the curse even make it into the castle not what call foolproof 
 
 right said hermione prodding ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again it very well at all 
 
 but since when has malfoy been one of the great thinkers asked harry 
 
 neither ron nor hermione answered him

 pointing his wand at nothing in particular he gave it an upward flick and said levicorpus inside his head 
 
 aaaaaaaargh 
 
 there was a flash of light and the room was full of voices everyone had woken up as ron had let out a yell harry sent advanced flying in panic ron was dangling in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle 
 
 sorry yelled harry as dean and seamus roared with laughter and neville picked himself up from the floor having fallen out of bed hang let you down 
 
 he groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered the cramped word underneath the spell praying that this was the harry thought liberacorpus with all his might there was another flash of light and ron fell in a heap onto his mattress 
 
 sorry repeated harry weakly while dean and seamus continued to roar with laughter 
 
 tomorrow said ron in a muffled voice rather you set the alarm clock 
 
 by the time they had got dressed padding themselves out with several of mrs sweaters and carrying cloaks scarves and gloves shock had subsided and he had decided that new spell was highly amusing so amusing in fact that he lost no time in regaling hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast 
 
 and then there was another flash of light and i landed on the bed again ron grinned helping himself to sausages 
 
 hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon harry 
 
 was this spell by any chance another one from that potion book of yours she asked 
 
 harry frowned at her 
 
 always jump to the worst conclusion you 
 
 was it 
 
 well yeah it was but so what 
 
 so you just decided to try out an unknown handwritten incantation and see what would happen 
 
 why does it matter if handwritten said harry preferring not to answer the rest of the question 
 
 because probably not ministry of magic approved said hermione and also she added as harry and ron rolled their eyes because starting to think this prince character was a bit dodgy 
 
 both harry and ron shouted her down at once 
 
 it was a laugh said ron upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages just a laugh hermione all 
 
 dangling people upside down by the ankle said hermione who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that 
 
 fred and george said ron shrugging their kind of thing and er 
 
 my dad said harry he had only just remembered 
 
 what said ron and hermione together 
 
 my dad used this spell said harry ilupin told me 
 
 this last part was not true in fact harry had seen his father use the spell on snape but he had never told ron and hermione about that particular excursion into the pensieve now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him could the prince possibly be 
 
 maybe your dad did use it harry said hermione but not the only one seen a whole bunch of people use it in case forgotten dangling people in the air making them float along asleep helpless 
 
 harry stared at her with a sinking feeling he too remembered the behavior of the death eaters at the quidditch world cup ron came to his aid 
 
 that was different he said robustly they were abusing it harry and his dad were just having a laugh you like the prince hermione he added pointing a sausage at her sternly because better than you at potions 
 
 got nothing to do with that said hermione her cheeks reddening i just think very irresponsible to start performing spells when you even know what for and stop talking about the prince as if his title i bet just a stupid nickname and it seem as though he was a very nice person to me 
 
 i see where you get that from said harry heatedly if been a budding death eater he have been boasting about being would he 
 
 even as he said it harry remembered that his father had been but he pushed the thought out of his mind he would worry about that later 
 
 the death eaters all be there enough wizards left said hermione stubbornly i expect most of them are pretending to be pure only they hate be quite happy to let you and ron join up 
 
 there is no way let me be a death eater said ron indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at hermione and hitting ernie macmillan on the head my whole family are blood traitors as bad as to death eaters 
 
 and love to have me said harry sarcastically be best pals if they keep trying to do me in 
 
 this made ron laugh even hermione gave a grudging smile and a distraction arrived in the shape of ginny 
 
 hey harry supposed to give you this 
 
 it was a scroll of parchment with name written upon it in familiar thin slanting writing 
 
 thanks ginny next lesson harry told ron and hermione pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents monday evening he felt suddenly light and happy want to join us in hogsmeade ginny he asked 
 
 going with deanmight see you there she replied waving at them as she left 
 
 filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual checking off the names of people who had permission to go into hogsmeade the process took even longer than normal as filch was everybody with his secrecy sensor 
 
 what does it matter if smuggling dark stuff out demanded ron eyeing the long thin secrecy sensor with apprehension surely you ought to be checking what we bring back in 
 
 his cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the sensor and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet 
 
 the walk into hogsmeade was not enjoyable harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb the road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind more than once harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room and when they finally reached hogsmeade and saw that joke shop had been boarded up harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun ron pointed with a thickly gloved hand toward honeydukes which was mercifully open and harry and hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop 
 
 thank god shivered ron as they were enveloped by warm air stay here all afternoon 
 
 harry said a booming voice from behind them 
 
 oh no muttered harry the three of them turned to see professor slughorn who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop 
 
 harry three of my little suppers missed now said slughorn poking him genially in the chest it do determined to have you miss granger loves them you 
 
 yes said hermione helplessly really 
 
 so why you come along harry demanded slughorn 
 
 well had quidditch practice professor said harry who had indeed been scheduling practices every time slughorn had sent him a little violet invitation this strategy meant that ron was not left out and they usually had a laugh with ginny imagining hermione shut up with mclaggen and zabini 
 
 well i certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work said slughorn but a little recreation never hurt any body now how about monday night you possibly want to practice in this weather 
 
 i professor got eran appointment with professor dumbledore that evening 
 
 unlucky again cried slughorn dramatically ah well you evade me forever harry 
 
 and with a regal wave he waddled out of the shop taking as little notice of ron as though he had been a display of cockroach clusters 
 
 i believe wriggled out of another one said hermione shaking her head not that bad you know even quite fun sometimes but then she caught sight of expression oh got deluxe sugar quillsthose would last hours 
 
 glad that hermione had changed the subject harry showed much more interest in the new sugar quills than he would normally have done but ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when hermione asked him where he wanted to go next 
 
 go to the three broomsticks said harry be warm 
 
 they bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop the bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of honeydukes the street was not very busy nobody was lingering to chat just hurrying toward their destinations the exceptions were two men a little ahead of them standing just outside the three broomsticks one was very tall and thin squinting through his glasses harry recognized the barman who worked in the other hogsmeade pub the head as harry ron and hermione drew closer the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms they were barely feet from him when harry realized who the man was 
 
 mundungus 
 
 the squat man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase which burst open releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window 
 
 oh ello arry said mundungus fletcher with a most unconvincing stab at airiness well let me keep ya 
 
 and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone 
 
 are you selling this stuff asked harry watching mundungus grab an assortment of objects from the ground 
 
 oh well gotta scrape a living said mundungus gimme that 
 
 ron had stooped down and picked up something silver 
 
 hang on ron said slowly this looks familiar 
 
 thank you said mundungus snatching the goblet out of hand and stuffing it back into the case well see you allouch 
 
 harry had pinned mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat holding him fast with one hand he pulled out his wand 
 
 harry squealed hermione 
 
 you took that from house said harry who was almost nose to nose with mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits that had the black family crest on it 
 
 inowhat spluttered mundungus who was slowly turning purple 
 
 what did you do go back the night he died and strip the place snarled harry 
 
 ino 
 
 give it to me 
 
 harry you shrieked hermione as mundungus started to turn blue 
 
 there was a bang and harry felt his hands fly off throat gasping and spluttering mundungus seized his fallen case thencrack he disapparated 
 
 harry swore at the top of his voice spinning on the spot to see where mundungus had gone 
 
 come back you thieving 
 
 no point harry tonks had appeared out of nowhere her mousy hair wet with sleet 
 
 mundungus will probably be in london by now no point yelling 
 
 nicked stuff nicked it 
 
 yes but still said tonks who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information you should get out of the cold 
 
 she watched them go through the door of the three broomsticks the moment he was inside harry burst out he was nicking stuff 
 
 i know harry but please shout people are staring whispered hermione go and sit down get you a drink 
 
 harry was still fuming when hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer 
 
 the order control mundungus harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper they at least stop him stealing everything not fixed down when at headquarters 
 
 shh said hermione desperately looking around to make sure nobody was listening there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at harry with great interest and zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away harry be annoyed too i know your things stealing 
 
 harry gagged on his butterbeer he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 yeah my stuff he said no wonder he pleased to see me well going to tell dumbledore going on the only one who scares mundungus 
 
 good idea whispered hermione clearly pleased that harry was calming down ron what are you staring at 
 
 nothing said ron hastily looking away from the bar but harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid madam rosmerta for whom he had long nursed a soft spot 
 
 i expect in the back getting more firewhisky said hermione waspishly 
 
 ron ignored this jibe sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence harry was thinking about sirius and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway hermione drummed her fingers on the table her eyes flickering between ron and the bar the moment harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said shall we call it a day and go back to school then 
 
 the other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them rearranged their scarves pulled on their gloves then followed katie bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the high street thoughts strayed to ginny as they trudged up the road to hogwarts through the frozen slush they had not met up with her undoubtedly thought harry because she and dean were cozily closeted in madam tea shop that haunt of happy couples scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on 
 
 it was a little while before harry became aware that the voices of katie bell and her friend which were being carried back to him on the wind had become shriller and louder harry squinted at their indistinct figures the two girls were having an argument about something katie was holding in her hand 
 
 nothing to do with you leanne harry heard katie say 
 
 they rounded a corner in the lane sleet coming thick and fast blurring glasses just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them leanne made to grab hold of the package katie was holding katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground 
 
 at once katie rose into the air not as ron had done suspended comically by the ankle but gracefully her arms outstretched as though she was about to fly yet there was something wrong something eerie her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression harry ron hermione and leanne had all halted in their tracks watching 
 
 then six feet above the ground katie let out a terrible scream her eyes flew open but whatever she could see or whatever she was feeling was clearly causing her terrible anguish she screamed and screamed leanne started to scream too and seized ankles trying to tug her back to the ground harry ron and hermione rushed forward to help but even as they grabbed legs she fell on top of them harry and ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them 
 
 harry looked around the landscape seemed deserted 
 
 stay there he shouted at the others over the howling wind going for help 
 
 he began to sprint toward the school he had never seen anyone behave as katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs 
 
 hagrid he panted disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen 
 
 harry said hagrid who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard and was wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat jus bin visitin grawp comin on so well yeh wouldn 
 
 hagrid hurt back there or cursed or something 
 
 wha said hagrid bending lower to hear what harry was saying over the raging wind 
 
 been cursed bellowed harry 
 
 cursed bin cursednot ron hermione 
 
 no not them katie bellthis way 
 
 together they ran back along the lane it took them no time to find the little group of people around katie who was still writhing and screaming on the ground ron hermione and leanne were all trying to quiet her 
 
 get back shouted hagrid lemme see her 
 
 happened to her sobbed leanne i know what 
 
 hagrid stared at katie for a second then without a word bent down scooped her into his arms and ran off toward the castle with her within seconds piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind 
 
 hermione hurried over to wailing friend and put an arm around her 
 
 leanne it 
 
 the girl nodded 
 
 did it just happen all of a sudden or 
 
 it was when that package tore sobbed leanne pointing at the now sodden package on the ground which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter ron bent down his hand outstretched but harry seized his arm and pulled him back 
 
 touch it 
 
 he crouched down an ornate opal necklace was visible poking out of the paper 
 
 seen that before said harry staring at the thing it was on display in borgin and burkes ages ago the label said it was cursed katie must have touched it he looked up at leanne who had started to shake uncontrollably how did katie get hold of this 
 
 well why we were arguing she came back from the bathroom in the three broomsticks holding it said it was a surprise for somebody at hogwarts and she had to deliver it she looked all funny when she said it oh no oh no i bet been imperiused and i realize 
 
 leanne shook with renewed sobs hermione patted her shoulder gently 
 
 she say given it to her leanne 
 
 no she tell me and i said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school but she just listen and and then i tried to grab it from her and and 
 
 leanne let out a wail of despair 
 
 better get up to school said hermione her arm still around leanne be able to find out how she is come on 
 
 harry hesitated for a moment then pulled his scarf from around his face and ignoring gasp carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up 
 
 need to show this to madam pomfrey he said 
 
 as they followed hermione and leanne up the road harry was thinking furiously they had just entered the grounds when he spoke unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer 
 
 malfoy knows about this necklace it was in a case at borgin and burkes four years ago i saw him having a good look at it while i was hiding from him and his dad this is what he was buying that day when we followed him he remembered it and he went back for it 
 
 ii dunno harry said ron hesitantly loads of people go to borgin and burke and that girl say katie got it in the girls bathroom 
 
 she said she came back from the bathroom with it she necessarily get it in the bathroom itself 
 
 mcgonagall said ron warningly 
 
 harry looked up sure enough professor mcgonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them 
 
 hagrid says you four saw what happened to katie bellupstairs to my office at once please that holding potter 
 
 the thing she touched said harry 
 
 good lord said professor mcgonagall looking alarmed as she took the necklace from harry no no filch with me she added hastily as filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his secrecy sensor aloft take this necklace to professor snape at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf 
 
 harry and the others followed professor mcgonagall upstairs and into her office the windows were rattling in their frames and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate professor mcgonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face harry ron hermione and the still sobbing leanne 
 
 well she said sharply what happened 
 
 haltingly and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying leanne told professor mcgonagall how katie had gone to the bathroom in the three broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package how katie had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel which tore open at this point leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her 
 
 all right said professor mcgonagall not unkindly go up to the hospital wing please leanne and get madam pomfrey to give you something for shock 
 
 when she had left the room professor mcgonagall turned back to harry ron and hermione 
 
 what happened when katie touched the necklace 
 
 she rose up in the air said harry before either ron or hermione could speak and then began to scream and collapsed professor can i see professor dumbledore please 
 
 the headmaster is away until monday potter said professor mcgonagall looking surprised 
 
 away harry repeated angrily 
 
 yes potter away said professor mcgonagall tartly but anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me sure 
 
 for a split second harry hesitated professor mcgonagall did not invite confidences dumbledore though in many ways more intimidating still seemed less likely to scorn a theory however wild this was a matter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at 
 
 i think draco malfoy gave katie that necklace professor 
 
 on one side of him ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment on the other hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and harry 
 
 that is a very serious accusation potter said professor mcgonagall after a shocked pause do you have any proof 
 
 no said harry but and he told her about following malfoy to borgin and burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and mr borgin 
 
 when he had finished speaking professor mcgonagall looked slightly confused 
 
 malfoy took something to borgin and burkes for repair 
 
 no professor he just wanted borgin to tell him how to mend something he have it with him but not the point the thing is that he bought something at the same time and i think it was that necklace 
 
 you saw malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package 
 
 no professor he told borgin to keep it in the shop for him 
 
 but harry hermione interrupted borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and malfoy said no 
 
 because he want to touch it obviously said harry angrily 
 
 what he actually said was how would i look carrying that down the street said hermione 
 
 well he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace interjected ron 
 
 oh ron said hermione despairingly it would be all wrapped up so he have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would see it i think whatever he reserved at borgin and burkes was noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the streetand in any case she pressed on loudly before harry could interrupt i asked borgin about the necklace you remember when i went in to try and find out what malfoy had asked him to keep i saw it there and borgin just told me the price he say it was already sold or anything 
 
 well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five seconds of course he going to tell youanyway malfoy sent off for it since 
 
 enough said professor mcgonagall as hermione opened her mouth to retort looking furious potter i appreciate you telling me this but we cannot point the finger of blame at mr malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased the same is probably true of hundreds of people 
 
 what i said muttered ron 
 
 and in any case we have put stringent security measures in place this year i do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge 
 
 but 
 
 and what is more said professor mcgonagall with an air of awful finality mr malfoy was not in hogsmeade today 
 
 harry gaped at her deflating 
 
 how do you know professor 
 
 because he was doing detention with me he has now failed to complete his transfiguration homework twice in a row so thank you for telling me your suspicions potter she said as she marched past them but i need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on katie bell good day to you all 
 
 she held open her office door they had no choice but to file past her without another word 
 
 harry was angry with the other two for siding with mcgonagall nevertheless he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened 
 
 so who do you reckon katie was supposed to give the necklace to asked ron as they climbed the stairs to the common room 
 
 goodness only knows said hermione but whoever it was has had a narrow escape no one could have opened that package without touching the necklace 
 
 it been meant for loads of people said harry dumbledorethe death eaters would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top targets or slughorn dumbledore reckons voldemort really wanted him and they be pleased that sided with dumbledore or 
 
 or you said hermione looking troubled 
 
 have been said harry or katie just turned around in the lane and given it to me she i was behind her all the way out of the three broomsticks it would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside hogwarts what with filch searching everyone who goes in and out i wonder why malfoy told her to take it into the castle 
 
 harry malfoy in hogsmeade said hermione actually stamping her foot in frustration 
 
 he must have used an accomplice then said harry crabbe or goyleor come to think of it another death eater have loads better cronies than crabbe and goyle now joined up 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged looks that plainly said no point arguing with him 
 
 dilligrout said hermione firmly as they reached the fat lady 
 
 the portrait swung open to admit them to the common room it was quite full and smelled of damp clothing many people seemed to have returned from hogsmeade early because of the bad weather there was no buzz of fear or speculation however clearly the news of fate had not yet spread 
 
 it a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it said ron casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down the curse even make it into the castle not what call foolproof 
 
 right said hermione prodding ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again it very well at all 
 
 but since when has malfoy been one of the great thinkers asked harry 
 
 neither ron nor hermione answered him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelve magic is mightcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 as august wore on the square of unkempt grass in the middle of grimmauld place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown the inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses and nor was number twelve itself the muggles who lived in grimmauld place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen 
 
 and yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in grimmauld place with no other purpose or so it seemed than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen watching the join between the two houses the lurkers were never the same two days running although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing most of the londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice though occasionally one of them might glance back wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat 
 
 the watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil occasionally one of them started forward excitedly as if they had seen something interesting at last only to fall back looking disappointed 
 
 on the first day of september there were more people lurking in the square than ever before half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive as evening drew in bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting the man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion a podgy pallid man started forward but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity looking frustrated and disappointed 
 
 meanwhile inside number twelve harry had just entered the hall he had nearly lost his balance as he apparated onto the top step just outside the front door and thought that the death eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow shutting the front door carefully behind him he pulled off the invisibility cloak draped it over his arm and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement a stolen copy of the daily prophet clutched in his hand 
 
 the usual low whisper of severus snape greeted him the chill wind swept him and his tongue rolled up for a moment 
 
 i didnt kill you he said once it had unrolled then held his breath as the dusty exploded he waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen out of earshot of mrs black and clear of the dust cloud before calling ive got news and you wont like it 
 
 the kitchen was almost unrecognizable every surface now shone copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow the wooden tabletop gleamed the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire on which a cauldron was simmering nothing in the room however was more dramatically different than the who now came hurrying toward harry dressed in a towel his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool reguluss locket bouncing on his thin chest 
 
 shoes off if you please master harry and hands washed before dinner croaked kreacher seizing the invisibility cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall beside a number of robes that had been freshly laundered 
 
 whats happened ron asked apprehensively he are hermione had been pouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table but now they watched harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment 
 
 a large picture of a familiar man stared up at them all beneath a headline that read 
 
 
 
 
 severus snape confirmed 
 as hogwarts headmaster 
 no said ron and hermione loudly 
 
 hermione was quickest she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud 
 
 severus snape potions master at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school following the resignation of the previous muggle studies teacher alecto carrow will take over the post while her brother amycus fills the position of defense against the dark arts professor 
 
 i welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest wizarding traditions and values c like committing murder and cutting off peoples ears i suppose snape headmaster snape in dumbledores study c merlins pants she shrieked making both harry and ron jump she leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room shouting as she went ill be back in a minute 
 
 merlins pants repeated ron looking amused she must be upset he pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about snape 
 
 the other teachers wont stand for this mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout all know the truth they know how dumbledore died they wont accept snape as headmaster and who are these carrows 
 
 death eaters said harry there are pictures of them inside they were at the top of the tower when snape killed dumbledore so its all friends together and harry went on bitterly drawing up a chair i cant see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay if the ministry and voldemort are behind snape itll be a choice between staying and teaching or a nice few years in azkaban c and thats if theyre lucky i reckon theyll stay to try and protect the students 
 
 kreacher came bustling to the table with a large curcen in his hands and ladled out soup into pristine bowls whistling between his teeth as he did so 
 
 thanks kreacher said harry flipping over the prophet so as not to have to look at snapes face well at least we know exactly where snape is now 
 
 he began to spoon soup into his mouth the quality of kreachers cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given reguluss locket todays french onion was as good as harry had ever tasted 
 
 there are still a load of death eaters watching this house he told ron as he ate more than usual its like theyre hoping well march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the hogwarts express 
 
 ron glanced at his watch 
 
 ive been thinking about that all day it left nearly six hours ago weird not being on it isnt it 
 
 in his minds eye harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and ron had once followed it by air shimmering between fields and hills a rippling scarlet caterpillar he was sure ginny neville and luna were sitting together at this moment perhaps wondering where he ron and hermione were or debating how best to undermine snapes new regime 
 
 they nearly saw me coming back in just now harry said i landed badly on the top step and the cloak slipped 
 
 i do that every time oh here she is ron added craning around in his seat to watch hermione reentering the kitchen and what in the name of merlins most baggy y fronts was that about 
 
 i remembered this hermione panted 
 
 she was carrying a large framed picture which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard opening it she proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag within a few seconds it had vanished like so much ease into the bags capacious depths 
 
 phineas nigellus hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous clanking crash 
 
 sorry said ron but harry understood the painted image of phineas nigellus black was able to travel between his portrait in grimmauld place and the one that hung in the headmasters office at hogwarts the circular room where snape was no doubt sitting right now in triumphant possession of dumbledores collection of delicate silver magical instruments the stone pensieve the sorting hat and unless it ad been moved elsewhere the sword of gryffindor 
 
 snape could send phineas nigellus to look inside this house for him hermione explained to ron as she resumed her seat but let him try it now all phineas nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag 
 
 good thinking said ron looking impressed 
 
 thank you smiled hermione pulling her soup toward her so harry what else happened today 
 
 nothing said harry watched the ministry entrance for seven hours no sign of her saw your dad though ron he looks fine 
 
 ron nodded his appreciation of this news the had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with mr weasley while he walked in and out of the ministry because he was always surrounded by other ministry workers it was however reassuring to catch these glimpses of him even if he did look very strained and anxious 
 
 dad always told us most ministry people use the floo network to get to work ron said thats why we havent seen umbridge shed never walk shed think shes too important 
 
 and what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes hermione asked 
 
 oh yeah the bloke from magical maintenance said ron 
 
 how do you know he works for magical maintenance hermione asked her soupspoon suspended in midair 
 
 dad said everyone from magical maintenance wears navy blue robes 
 
 but you never told us that 
 
 hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and ron had been examining when harry had entered the kitchen 
 
 theres nothing in here about navy blue robes nothing she said flipping feverishly through the pages 
 
 well does it really matter 
 
 ron it all matters if were going to get into the ministry and not give ourselves away when theyre bound to be on the lookout for intruders every little detail matters weve been over and over this i mean whats the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you arent even bothering to tell us c 
 
 blimey hermione i forget one little thing c 
 
 you do realize dont you that theres probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the ministry of c 
 
 i think we should do it tomorrow said harry 
 
 hermione stopped dead her jaw hanging ron choked a little over his soup 
 
 tomorrow repeated hermione you arent serious harry 
 
 i am said harry i dont think were going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the ministry entrance for another month the longer we put it off the farther away that locket could be theres already a good chance umbridge has chucked it away the thing doesnt open 
 
 unless said ron shes found a way of opening it and shes now possessed 
 
 wouldnt make any difference to her she was so evil in the first place harry shrugged 
 
 hermione was biting her lip deep in thought 
 
 we know everything important harry went on addressing hermione we know theyve stopped apparition in and out of the ministry we know only the most senior ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the floo network now because ron heard those two unspeakables complaining about it and we know roughly where umbridges office is because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate c 
 
 ill be up on level one dolores wants to see me hermione recited immediately 
 
 exactly said harry and we know you get in using those funny coins or tokens or whatever they are because i saw that witch borrowing one from her friend c 
 
 but we havent got any 
 
 if the plan works we will have harry continued calmly 
 
 i dont know harry i dont know there are an awful lot of things that could go wrong so much relies on chance 
 
 thatll be true even if we spend another three months preparing said harry its time to act 
 
 he could tell from rons and hermiones faces that they were scared he was not particularly confident himself and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation 
 
 they had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the invisibility cloak and spy on the official entrance to the ministry which ron thanks to mr weasley had known since childhood they had tailed ministry workers on their way in eavesdropped on their conversations and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear alone at the same time every day occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a daily prophet out of somebodys briefcase slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of hermione 
 
 all right said ron slowly lets say we go for it tomorrow i think it should just be me and harry 
 
 oh dont start that again sighed hermione i thought wed settled this 
 
 its one thing hanging around the entrances under the cloak but this is different hermione ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the daily prophet dated ten days previously youre on the list of who didnt present themselves for interrogation 
 
 and youre supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the burrow if anyone shouldnt go its harry hes got a price on his head c 
 
 fine ill stay here said harry let me know if you ever defeat voldemort wont you 
 
 as ron and hermione laughed pain shot through the scar on harrys forehead his hand jumped to it he saw hermiones eyes narrow and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes 
 
 well if all three of us go well have to disapparate separately ron was saying we cant all fit under the cloak anymore 
 
 harrys scar was becoming more and more painful he stood up at once kreacher hurried forward 
 
 master has not finished his soup would master prefer the savory stew or else the treacle tart to which master is so partial 
 
 thanks kreacher but ill be back in a minute c er c bathroom 
 
 aware that hermione was watching him suspiciously harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again grunting with pain he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of serpents and closed his eyes 
 
 he was gliding along a twilit street the buildings on either side of him had high timbered gables they looked like gingerbread houses he approached one of them then saw the whiteness of his own hand against the door he knocked he felt a mounting excitement 
 
 the door opened a laughing woman stood there her face fell as she looked into harrys face humor gone terror replacing it 
 
 gregorovitch said a high cold voice 
 
 she shook her head she was trying to close the door a white hand held it steady prevented her shutting him out 
 
 i want gregorovitch 
 
 er wohnt hier nicht mehr she cried shaking her head he no live here he no live here i know him not 
 
 abandoning the attempt to close the door she began to back away down the dark hall and harry followed gliding toward her and his hand had drawn his wand 
 
 where is he 
 
 das wei ich nicht he move i know not i know not 
 
 he raised his hand she screamed two young children came running into the hall she tried to shield them with her arms there was a flash of green light c 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes he had sunk to the floor hermione was pounding on the door again 
 
 harry open up 
 
 he had shouted out he knew it he got up and unbolted the door hermione toppled inside at once regained her balance and looked around suspiciously ron was right behind her looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom 
 
 what were you doing asked hermione sternly 
 
 what dyou think i was doing asked harry with feeble bravado 
 
 you were yelling your head off said ron 
 
 oh yeah i mustve dozed off or c 
 
 harry please dont insult our intelligence said hermione taking deep breaths we know your scar hurt downstairs and youre white as a sheet 
 
 harry sat down on the edge of the bath 
 
 fine ive just seen voldemort murdering a woman by now hes probably killed her whole family and he didnt need to it was cedric all over again they were just there 
 
 harry you arent supposed to let this happen anymore hermione cried her voice echoing through the bathroom dumbledore wanted you to use occlumency he thought the connection was dangerous c voldemort can use it harry what good is it to watch him kill and torture how can it help 
 
 because it means i know what hes doing said harry 
 
 so youre not even going to try to shut him out 
 
 hermione i cant you know im lousy at occlumency i never got the hang of it 
 
 you never really tried she said hotly i dont get it harry c do you like having this special connection or relationship or what c whatever c 
 
 she faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up 
 
 like it he said quietly would you like it 
 
 i c no c im sorry harry i just didnt mean c 
 
 i hate it i hate the fact that he can get inside me that i have to watch him when hes most dangerous but im going to use it 
 
 dumbledore c 
 
 forget dumbledore this is my choice nobody elses i want to know why hes after gregorovitch 
 
 who 
 
 hes a foreign wandmaker said harry he made krums wand and krum reckons hes brilliant 
 
 but according to you said ron voldemorts got ollivander locked up somewhere if hes already got a wandmaker what does he need another one for 
 
 maybe he agrees with krum maybe he thinks gregorovitch is better or else he thinks gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me because ollivander didnt know 
 
 harry glanced into the cracked dusty mirror and saw ron and hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back 
 
 harry you keep talking about what your wand did said hermione but you made it happen why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power 
 
 because i know it wasnt me and so does voldemort hermione we both know what really happened 
 
 they glared at each other harry knew that he had not convinced hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into voldemorts mind to his relief ron intervened 
 
 drop it he advised her its up to him and if were going to the ministry tomorrow dont you reckon we should go over the plan 
 
 reluctantly as the other two could tell hermione let the matter rest though harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity in the meantime they returned to the basement kitchen where kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart 
 
 they did not get to bed until late that night after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it word perfect to each other harry who was now sleeping in siriuss room lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father sirius lupin and pettigrew and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes as he extinguished his wand however he was thinking not of polyjuice potion puking pastilles or the navy blue robes of magical maintenance he thought of gregorovitch the wandmaker and how long he could hope to remain hidden while voldemort sought him so determinedly 
 
 dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste 
 
 you look terrible was rons greeting as he entered the room to wake harry 
 
 not for long said harry yawning 
 
 they found hermione downstairs in the kitchen she was being served coffee and hot rolls by kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that harry associated with exam review 
 
 robes she said under her breath acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag polyjuice potion invisibility cloak decoy detonators you should each take a couple just in case puking pastilles nosebleed norgat extendable ears 
 
 they gulped down their breakfast then set off upstairs kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a pie ready for them when they returned 
 
 bless him said ron fondly and when you think i used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall 
 
 they made their way onto the front step with immense caution they could see a couple of death eaters watching the house from across the misty square 
 
 hermione disapparated with ron first then came back for harry 
 
 after the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place it was as yet deserted except for a couple of large bins the first ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight oclock 
 
 right then said hermione checking her watch she ought to be here in about five minutes when ive stunned her c 
 
 hermione we know said ron sternly and i thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here 
 
 hermione squealed 
 
 i nearly forgot stand back c 
 
 she pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them which burst open with a crash the dark corridor behind it led as they knew from their careful scouting trips into an empty theater hermione pulled the door back toward her to make it look as thought it was still closed 
 
 and now she said turning back to face the other two in the alleyway we put on the cloak again c 
 
 c and we wait ron finished throwing it over hermiones head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at harry 
 
 little more than a minute later there was a tiny pop and a little ministry witch with flyaway gray hair apparated feet from them blinking a little in the sudden brightness the sun had just come out from behind a cloud she barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth however before hermiones silent stunning spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over 
 
 nicely done hermione said ron emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as harry took off the invisibility cloak together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage hermione plucked a few hairs from the witchs head and added them to a flask of muddy polyjuice potion she had taken from the beaded bag ron was rummaging through the little witchs handbag 
 
 shes mafalda hopkirk he said reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the improper use of magic office youd better take this hermione and here are the tokens 
 
 he passed her several small golden coins all embossed with the letters which he had taken from the witchs purse 
 
 hermione drank the polyjuice potion which was now a pleasant heliotrope color and within seconds stood before them the double of mafalda hopkirk as she removed mafaldas spectacles and put them on harry checked his watch 
 
 were running late mr magical maintenance will be here any second 
 
 they hurried to close the door on the real mafalda harry and ron threw the invisibility cloak over themselves but hermione remained in view waiting seconds later there was another pop and a small ferrety looking wizard appeared before them 
 
 oh hello mafalda 
 
 hello said hermione in a quavery voice how are you today 
 
 not so good actually replied the little wizard who looked thoroughly downcast 
 
 as hermione and the wizard headed for the main road harry and ron crept along behind them 
 
 im sorry to hear youre under the weather said hermione talking firmly over the little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems it was essential to stop him from reaching the street here have a sweet 
 
 eh oh no thanks c 
 
 i insist said hermione aggressively shaking the bag of pastilles in his face looking rather alarmed the little wizard took one 
 
 the effect was instantaneous the moment the pastille touched his tongue the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head 
 
 oh dear she said as he splattered the alley with sick perhaps youd better take the day off 
 
 no c no he choked and retched trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight i must c today c must go c 
 
 but thats just silly said hermione alarmed you cant go to work in this state c i think you ought to go to st mungos and get them to sort you out 
 
 the wizard had collapsed heaving onto all fours still trying to crawl toward the main street 
 
 you simply cant go to work like this cried hermione 
 
 at last he seemed to accept the truth of her words using a reposed hermione to claw his way back into a standing position he turned on the spot and vanished leaving nothing behind but the bag ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit 
 
 urgh said hermione holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick it would have made much less mess to stun him too 
 
 yeah said ron emerging from under the cloak holding the wizards bag but i still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention keen on his job though isnt he chuck us the hair and the potion then 
 
 within two minutes ron stood before them as small and ferrety as the sick wizard and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag 
 
 weird he wasnt wearing them today wasnt it seeing how much he wanted to go anyway im reg cattermole according to the label in the back 
 
 now wait here hermione told harry who was still under the invisibility cloak and well be back with some hairs for you 
 
 he had to wait ten minutes but it seemed much longer to harry skulking alone in the alleyway beside the door concealing the stunned mafalda finally ron and hermione reappeared 
 
 we dont know who he is hermione said passing harry several curly black hairs but hes gone home with a dreadful nosebleed here hes pretty tall youll need bigger robes 
 
 she pulled out a set of the old robes kreacher had laundered for them and harry retired to take the potion and change 
 
 once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and from what he could tell from his arms powerfully built he also had a beard stowing the invisibility cloak and his glasses inside his new robes he rejoined the other two 
 
 blimey thats scary said ron looking up at harry who now towered over him 
 
 take one of mafaldas tokens hermione told harry and lets go its nearly nine 
 
 they stepped out of the alleyway together fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs one labeled gentlemen the other ladies 
 
 see you in a moment then said hermione nervously and she tottered off down the steps to ladies harry and ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet tiled in grimy black and white 
 
 morning reg called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door blooming pain in the bum this eh forcing us all to get to work this way who are they expecting to turn up harry potter 
 
 the wizard roared with laughter at his own wit ron gave a forced chuckle 
 
 yeah he said stupid isnt it 
 
 and he and harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles 
 
 to harrys left and right came the sound of flushing he crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door he looked left and saw ron blinking at him 
 
 we have to flush ourselves in he whispered 
 
 looks like it harry whispered back his voice came out deep and gravelly 
 
 they both stood up feeling exceptionally foolish harry clambered into the toilet 
 
 he knew at once that he had done the right thing thought he appeared to be standing in water his shoes feet and robes remained quite dry he reached up pulled the chain and next moment had zoomed down a short chute emerging out of a fireplace into the ministry of magic 
 
 he got up clumsily there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to the great atrium seemed darker than harry remembered it previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene it was rather frightening this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones looking down at the ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them engraved in letters at the base of the statue were the words magic is might 
 
 harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him 
 
 out of the way cant y c oh sorry runcorn 
 
 clearly frightened the balding wizard hurried away apparently the man who harry was impersonating runcorn was intimidating 
 
 psst said a voice and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from magical maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue harry hastened to join them 
 
 you got in all right then hermione whispered to harry 
 
 no hes still stuck in the hog said ron 
 
 oh very funny its horrible isnt it she said to harry who was staring up at the statue have you seen what theyre sitting on 
 
 harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies men women and children all with rather stupid ugly faces twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards 
 
 muggles whispered hermione in their rightful place come on lets get going 
 
 they joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of dolores umbridge they passed through the gates and into a smaller hall where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts they had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said cattermole 
 
 they looked around harrys stomach turned over one of the death eaters who had witnessed dumbledores death was striding toward them the ministry workers beside them fell silent their eyes downcast harry could feel fear rippling through them 
 
 the mans scowling slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent sweeping robes which were embroidered with much gold thread someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically morning yaxley yaxley ignored them 
 
 i requested somebody from magical maintenance to sort out my office cattermole its still raining in there 
 
 ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene but nobody spoke 
 
 raining in your office thats c thats not good is it 
 
 ron gave a nervous laugh yaxleys eyes widened 
 
 you think its funny cattermole do you 
 
 a pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off 
 
 no said ron no of course c 
 
 you realize that i am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife cattermole in fact im quite surprised youre not down there holding her hand while she waits already given her up as a bad job have you probably wise be sure and marry a pureblood next time 
 
 hermione had let out a little squeak of horror yaxley looked at her she cough feebly and turned away 
 
 i c i c stammered ron 
 
 but if my wife were accused of being a mudblood said yaxley c not that any woman i married would ever be mistaken for such filth c and the head of department of magical law enforcement needed a job doing i would make it my priority to do this job cattermole do you understand me 
 
 yes whispered ron 
 
 then attend to it cattermole and if my office is not completely dry within an hour your wifes blood status will be in even greater doubt than it is now 
 
 the golden grille before them clattered open with a nod and unpleasant smile to harry who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of cattermole yaxley swept away toward another lift harry ron and hermione entered theirs but nobody followed them it was as if they were infectious the grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward 
 
 what am i going to do ron asked the other two at once he looked stricken if i dont turn up my wife i mean cattermoles wife c 
 
 well come with you we should stick together c began harry but ron shook his head feverishly 
 
 thats mental we havent got much time you two find umbridge ill go and sort out yaxleys office c but how do i stop a raining 
 
 try finite incantatem said hermione at once that should stop the rain if its a hex or curse if it doesnt somethings gone wrong with an atmospheric charm which will be more difficult to fix so as an interim measure try impervius to protect his belongings c 
 
 say it again slowly c said ron searching his pockets desperately for a quill but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt a disembodied female voice said level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau and the grilles slid open again admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift 
 
 morning albert said a bushily whiskered man smiling at harry he glanced over at ron and hermione as the lift creaked upward once more hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to ron the wizard leaned toward harry leering and muttering dirk cresswell eh from goblin liaison nice one albert im pretty confident ill get his job now 
 
 he winked harry smiled back hoping that this would suffice the lift stopped the grilles opened once more 
 
 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services said the disembodied witchs voice 
 
 harry saw hermione give ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift followed by the other wizards leaving harry and hermione alone the moment the golden door had closed hermione said very fast actually harry i think id better go after him i dont think he knows what hes doing and if he gets caught the whole thing c 
 
 level one minister of magic and support staff 
 
 the golden grilles slid apart again and hermione gasped four people stood before them two of them deep in conversation a wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold and a squat toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter twelve magic is mightcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 as august wore on the square of unkempt grass in the middle of grimmauld place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown the inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses and nor was number twelve itself the muggles who lived in grimmauld place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen 
 
 and yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in grimmauld place with no other purpose or so it seemed than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen watching the join between the two houses the lurkers were never the same two days running although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing most of the londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice though occasionally one of them might glance back wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat 
 
 the watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil occasionally one of them started forward excitedly as if they had seen something interesting at last only to fall back looking disappointed 
 
 on the first day of september there were more people lurking in the square than ever before half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive as evening drew in bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting the man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion a podgy pallid man started forward but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity looking frustrated and disappointed 
 
 meanwhile inside number twelve harry had just entered the hall he had nearly lost his balance as he apparated onto the top step just outside the front door and thought that the death eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow shutting the front door carefully behind him he pulled off the invisibility cloak draped it over his arm and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement a stolen copy of the daily prophet clutched in his hand 
 
 the usual low whisper of severus snape greeted him the chill wind swept him and his tongue rolled up for a moment 
 
 i didnt kill you he said once it had unrolled then held his breath as the dusty exploded he waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen out of earshot of mrs black and clear of the dust cloud before calling ive got news and you wont like it 
 
 the kitchen was almost unrecognizable every surface now shone copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow the wooden tabletop gleamed the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire on which a cauldron was simmering nothing in the room however was more dramatically different than the who now came hurrying toward harry dressed in a towel his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool reguluss locket bouncing on his thin chest 
 
 shoes off if you please master harry and hands washed before dinner croaked kreacher seizing the invisibility cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall beside a number of robes that had been freshly laundered 
 
 whats happened ron asked apprehensively he are hermione had been pouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table but now they watched harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment 
 
 a large picture of a familiar man stared up at them all beneath a headline that read 
 
 
 
 
 severus snape confirmed 
 as hogwarts headmaster 
 no said ron and hermione loudly 
 
 hermione was quickest she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud 
 
 severus snape potions master at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school following the resignation of the previous muggle studies teacher alecto carrow will take over the post while her brother amycus fills the position of defense against the dark arts professor 
 
 i welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest wizarding traditions and values c like committing murder and cutting off peoples ears i suppose snape headmaster snape in dumbledores study c merlins pants she shrieked making both harry and ron jump she leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room shouting as she went ill be back in a minute 
 
 merlins pants repeated ron looking amused she must be upset he pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about snape 
 
 the other teachers wont stand for this mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout all know the truth they know how dumbledore died they wont accept snape as headmaster and who are these carrows 
 
 death eaters said harry there are pictures of them inside they were at the top of the tower when snape killed dumbledore so its all friends together and harry went on bitterly drawing up a chair i cant see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay if the ministry and voldemort are behind snape itll be a choice between staying and teaching or a nice few years in azkaban c and thats if theyre lucky i reckon theyll stay to try and protect the students 
 
 kreacher came bustling to the table with a large curcen in his hands and ladled out soup into pristine bowls whistling between his teeth as he did so 
 
 thanks kreacher said harry flipping over the prophet so as not to have to look at snapes face well at least we know exactly where snape is now 
 
 he began to spoon soup into his mouth the quality of kreachers cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given reguluss locket todays french onion was as good as harry had ever tasted 
 
 there are still a load of death eaters watching this house he told ron as he ate more than usual its like theyre hoping well march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the hogwarts express 
 
 ron glanced at his watch 
 
 ive been thinking about that all day it left nearly six hours ago weird not being on it isnt it 
 
 in his minds eye harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and ron had once followed it by air shimmering between fields and hills a rippling scarlet caterpillar he was sure ginny neville and luna were sitting together at this moment perhaps wondering where he ron and hermione were or debating how best to undermine snapes new regime 
 
 they nearly saw me coming back in just now harry said i landed badly on the top step and the cloak slipped 
 
 i do that every time oh here she is ron added craning around in his seat to watch hermione reentering the kitchen and what in the name of merlins most baggy y fronts was that about 
 
 i remembered this hermione panted 
 
 she was carrying a large framed picture which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard opening it she proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag within a few seconds it had vanished like so much ease into the bags capacious depths 
 
 phineas nigellus hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous clanking crash 
 
 sorry said ron but harry understood the painted image of phineas nigellus black was able to travel between his portrait in grimmauld place and the one that hung in the headmasters office at hogwarts the circular room where snape was no doubt sitting right now in triumphant possession of dumbledores collection of delicate silver magical instruments the stone pensieve the sorting hat and unless it ad been moved elsewhere the sword of gryffindor 
 
 snape could send phineas nigellus to look inside this house for him hermione explained to ron as she resumed her seat but let him try it now all phineas nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag 
 
 good thinking said ron looking impressed 
 
 thank you smiled hermione pulling her soup toward her so harry what else happened today 
 
 nothing said harry watched the ministry entrance for seven hours no sign of her saw your dad though ron he looks fine 
 
 ron nodded his appreciation of this news the had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with mr weasley while he walked in and out of the ministry because he was always surrounded by other ministry workers it was however reassuring to catch these glimpses of him even if he did look very strained and anxious 
 
 dad always told us most ministry people use the floo network to get to work ron said thats why we havent seen umbridge shed never walk shed think shes too important 
 
 and what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes hermione asked 
 
 oh yeah the bloke from magical maintenance said ron 
 
 how do you know he works for magical maintenance hermione asked her soupspoon suspended in midair 
 
 dad said everyone from magical maintenance wears navy blue robes 
 
 but you never told us that 
 
 hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and ron had been examining when harry had entered the kitchen 
 
 theres nothing in here about navy blue robes nothing she said flipping feverishly through the pages 
 
 well does it really matter 
 
 ron it all matters if were going to get into the ministry and not give ourselves away when theyre bound to be on the lookout for intruders every little detail matters weve been over and over this i mean whats the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you arent even bothering to tell us c 
 
 blimey hermione i forget one little thing c 
 
 you do realize dont you that theres probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the ministry of c 
 
 i think we should do it tomorrow said harry 
 
 hermione stopped dead her jaw hanging ron choked a little over his soup 
 
 tomorrow repeated hermione you arent serious harry 
 
 i am said harry i dont think were going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the ministry entrance for another month the longer we put it off the farther away that locket could be theres already a good chance umbridge has chucked it away the thing doesnt open 
 
 unless said ron shes found a way of opening it and shes now possessed 
 
 wouldnt make any difference to her she was so evil in the first place harry shrugged 
 
 hermione was biting her lip deep in thought 
 
 we know everything important harry went on addressing hermione we know theyve stopped apparition in and out of the ministry we know only the most senior ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the floo network now because ron heard those two unspeakables complaining about it and we know roughly where umbridges office is because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate c 
 
 ill be up on level one dolores wants to see me hermione recited immediately 
 
 exactly said harry and we know you get in using those funny coins or tokens or whatever they are because i saw that witch borrowing one from her friend c 
 
 but we havent got any 
 
 if the plan works we will have harry continued calmly 
 
 i dont know harry i dont know there are an awful lot of things that could go wrong so much relies on chance 
 
 thatll be true even if we spend another three months preparing said harry its time to act 
 
 he could tell from rons and hermiones faces that they were scared he was not particularly confident himself and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation 
 
 they had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the invisibility cloak and spy on the official entrance to the ministry which ron thanks to mr weasley had known since childhood they had tailed ministry workers on their way in eavesdropped on their conversations and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear alone at the same time every day occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a daily prophet out of somebodys briefcase slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of hermione 
 
 all right said ron slowly lets say we go for it tomorrow i think it should just be me and harry 
 
 oh dont start that again sighed hermione i thought wed settled this 
 
 its one thing hanging around the entrances under the cloak but this is different hermione ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the daily prophet dated ten days previously youre on the list of who didnt present themselves for interrogation 
 
 and youre supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the burrow if anyone shouldnt go its harry hes got a price on his head c 
 
 fine ill stay here said harry let me know if you ever defeat voldemort wont you 
 
 as ron and hermione laughed pain shot through the scar on harrys forehead his hand jumped to it he saw hermiones eyes narrow and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes 
 
 well if all three of us go well have to disapparate separately ron was saying we cant all fit under the cloak anymore 
 
 harrys scar was becoming more and more painful he stood up at once kreacher hurried forward 
 
 master has not finished his soup would master prefer the savory stew or else the treacle tart to which master is so partial 
 
 thanks kreacher but ill be back in a minute c er c bathroom 
 
 aware that hermione was watching him suspiciously harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again grunting with pain he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of serpents and closed his eyes 
 
 he was gliding along a twilit street the buildings on either side of him had high timbered gables they looked like gingerbread houses he approached one of them then saw the whiteness of his own hand against the door he knocked he felt a mounting excitement 
 
 the door opened a laughing woman stood there her face fell as she looked into harrys face humor gone terror replacing it 
 
 gregorovitch said a high cold voice 
 
 she shook her head she was trying to close the door a white hand held it steady prevented her shutting him out 
 
 i want gregorovitch 
 
 er wohnt hier nicht mehr she cried shaking her head he no live here he no live here i know him not 
 
 abandoning the attempt to close the door she began to back away down the dark hall and harry followed gliding toward her and his hand had drawn his wand 
 
 where is he 
 
 das wei ich nicht he move i know not i know not 
 
 he raised his hand she screamed two young children came running into the hall she tried to shield them with her arms there was a flash of green light c 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes he had sunk to the floor hermione was pounding on the door again 
 
 harry open up 
 
 he had shouted out he knew it he got up and unbolted the door hermione toppled inside at once regained her balance and looked around suspiciously ron was right behind her looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom 
 
 what were you doing asked hermione sternly 
 
 what dyou think i was doing asked harry with feeble bravado 
 
 you were yelling your head off said ron 
 
 oh yeah i mustve dozed off or c 
 
 harry please dont insult our intelligence said hermione taking deep breaths we know your scar hurt downstairs and youre white as a sheet 
 
 harry sat down on the edge of the bath 
 
 fine ive just seen voldemort murdering a woman by now hes probably killed her whole family and he didnt need to it was cedric all over again they were just there 
 
 harry you arent supposed to let this happen anymore hermione cried her voice echoing through the bathroom dumbledore wanted you to use occlumency he thought the connection was dangerous c voldemort can use it harry what good is it to watch him kill and torture how can it help 
 
 because it means i know what hes doing said harry 
 
 so youre not even going to try to shut him out 
 
 hermione i cant you know im lousy at occlumency i never got the hang of it 
 
 you never really tried she said hotly i dont get it harry c do you like having this special connection or relationship or what c whatever c 
 
 she faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up 
 
 like it he said quietly would you like it 
 
 i c no c im sorry harry i just didnt mean c 
 
 i hate it i hate the fact that he can get inside me that i have to watch him when hes most dangerous but im going to use it 
 
 dumbledore c 
 
 forget dumbledore this is my choice nobody elses i want to know why hes after gregorovitch 
 
 who 
 
 hes a foreign wandmaker said harry he made krums wand and krum reckons hes brilliant 
 
 but according to you said ron voldemorts got ollivander locked up somewhere if hes already got a wandmaker what does he need another one for 
 
 maybe he agrees with krum maybe he thinks gregorovitch is better or else he thinks gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me because ollivander didnt know 
 
 harry glanced into the cracked dusty mirror and saw ron and hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back 
 
 harry you keep talking about what your wand did said hermione but you made it happen why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power 
 
 because i know it wasnt me and so does voldemort hermione we both know what really happened 
 
 they glared at each other harry knew that he had not convinced hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into voldemorts mind to his relief ron intervened 
 
 drop it he advised her its up to him and if were going to the ministry tomorrow dont you reckon we should go over the plan 
 
 reluctantly as the other two could tell hermione let the matter rest though harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity in the meantime they returned to the basement kitchen where kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart 
 
 they did not get to bed until late that night after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it word perfect to each other harry who was now sleeping in siriuss room lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father sirius lupin and pettigrew and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes as he extinguished his wand however he was thinking not of polyjuice potion puking pastilles or the navy blue robes of magical maintenance he thought of gregorovitch the wandmaker and how long he could hope to remain hidden while voldemort sought him so determinedly 
 
 dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste 
 
 you look terrible was rons greeting as he entered the room to wake harry 
 
 not for long said harry yawning 
 
 they found hermione downstairs in the kitchen she was being served coffee and hot rolls by kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that harry associated with exam review 
 
 robes she said under her breath acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag polyjuice potion invisibility cloak decoy detonators you should each take a couple just in case puking pastilles nosebleed norgat extendable ears 
 
 they gulped down their breakfast then set off upstairs kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a pie ready for them when they returned 
 
 bless him said ron fondly and when you think i used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall 
 
 they made their way onto the front step with immense caution they could see a couple of death eaters watching the house from across the misty square 
 
 hermione disapparated with ron first then came back for harry 
 
 after the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place it was as yet deserted except for a couple of large bins the first ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight oclock 
 
 right then said hermione checking her watch she ought to be here in about five minutes when ive stunned her c 
 
 hermione we know said ron sternly and i thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here 
 
 hermione squealed 
 
 i nearly forgot stand back c 
 
 she pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them which burst open with a crash the dark corridor behind it led as they knew from their careful scouting trips into an empty theater hermione pulled the door back toward her to make it look as thought it was still closed 
 
 and now she said turning back to face the other two in the alleyway we put on the cloak again c 
 
 c and we wait ron finished throwing it over hermiones head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at harry 
 
 little more than a minute later there was a tiny pop and a little ministry witch with flyaway gray hair apparated feet from them blinking a little in the sudden brightness the sun had just come out from behind a cloud she barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth however before hermiones silent stunning spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over 
 
 nicely done hermione said ron emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as harry took off the invisibility cloak together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage hermione plucked a few hairs from the witchs head and added them to a flask of muddy polyjuice potion she had taken from the beaded bag ron was rummaging through the little witchs handbag 
 
 shes mafalda hopkirk he said reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the improper use of magic office youd better take this hermione and here are the tokens 
 
 he passed her several small golden coins all embossed with the letters which he had taken from the witchs purse 
 
 hermione drank the polyjuice potion which was now a pleasant heliotrope color and within seconds stood before them the double of mafalda hopkirk as she removed mafaldas spectacles and put them on harry checked his watch 
 
 were running late mr magical maintenance will be here any second 
 
 they hurried to close the door on the real mafalda harry and ron threw the invisibility cloak over themselves but hermione remained in view waiting seconds later there was another pop and a small ferrety looking wizard appeared before them 
 
 oh hello mafalda 
 
 hello said hermione in a quavery voice how are you today 
 
 not so good actually replied the little wizard who looked thoroughly downcast 
 
 as hermione and the wizard headed for the main road harry and ron crept along behind them 
 
 im sorry to hear youre under the weather said hermione talking firmly over the little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems it was essential to stop him from reaching the street here have a sweet 
 
 eh oh no thanks c 
 
 i insist said hermione aggressively shaking the bag of pastilles in his face looking rather alarmed the little wizard took one 
 
 the effect was instantaneous the moment the pastille touched his tongue the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head 
 
 oh dear she said as he splattered the alley with sick perhaps youd better take the day off 
 
 no c no he choked and retched trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight i must c today c must go c 
 
 but thats just silly said hermione alarmed you cant go to work in this state c i think you ought to go to st mungos and get them to sort you out 
 
 the wizard had collapsed heaving onto all fours still trying to crawl toward the main street 
 
 you simply cant go to work like this cried hermione 
 
 at last he seemed to accept the truth of her words using a reposed hermione to claw his way back into a standing position he turned on the spot and vanished leaving nothing behind but the bag ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit 
 
 urgh said hermione holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick it would have made much less mess to stun him too 
 
 yeah said ron emerging from under the cloak holding the wizards bag but i still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention keen on his job though isnt he chuck us the hair and the potion then 
 
 within two minutes ron stood before them as small and ferrety as the sick wizard and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag 
 
 weird he wasnt wearing them today wasnt it seeing how much he wanted to go anyway im reg cattermole according to the label in the back 
 
 now wait here hermione told harry who was still under the invisibility cloak and well be back with some hairs for you 
 
 he had to wait ten minutes but it seemed much longer to harry skulking alone in the alleyway beside the door concealing the stunned mafalda finally ron and hermione reappeared 
 
 we dont know who he is hermione said passing harry several curly black hairs but hes gone home with a dreadful nosebleed here hes pretty tall youll need bigger robes 
 
 she pulled out a set of the old robes kreacher had laundered for them and harry retired to take the potion and change 
 
 once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and from what he could tell from his arms powerfully built he also had a beard stowing the invisibility cloak and his glasses inside his new robes he rejoined the other two 
 
 blimey thats scary said ron looking up at harry who now towered over him 
 
 take one of mafaldas tokens hermione told harry and lets go its nearly nine 
 
 they stepped out of the alleyway together fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs one labeled gentlemen the other ladies 
 
 see you in a moment then said hermione nervously and she tottered off down the steps to ladies harry and ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet tiled in grimy black and white 
 
 morning reg called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door blooming pain in the bum this eh forcing us all to get to work this way who are they expecting to turn up harry potter 
 
 the wizard roared with laughter at his own wit ron gave a forced chuckle 
 
 yeah he said stupid isnt it 
 
 and he and harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles 
 
 to harrys left and right came the sound of flushing he crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door he looked left and saw ron blinking at him 
 
 we have to flush ourselves in he whispered 
 
 looks like it harry whispered back his voice came out deep and gravelly 
 
 they both stood up feeling exceptionally foolish harry clambered into the toilet 
 
 he knew at once that he had done the right thing thought he appeared to be standing in water his shoes feet and robes remained quite dry he reached up pulled the chain and next moment had zoomed down a short chute emerging out of a fireplace into the ministry of magic 
 
 he got up clumsily there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to the great atrium seemed darker than harry remembered it previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene it was rather frightening this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones looking down at the ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them engraved in letters at the base of the statue were the words magic is might 
 
 harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him 
 
 out of the way cant y c oh sorry runcorn 
 
 clearly frightened the balding wizard hurried away apparently the man who harry was impersonating runcorn was intimidating 
 
 psst said a voice and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from magical maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue harry hastened to join them 
 
 you got in all right then hermione whispered to harry 
 
 no hes still stuck in the hog said ron 
 
 oh very funny its horrible isnt it she said to harry who was staring up at the statue have you seen what theyre sitting on 
 
 harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies men women and children all with rather stupid ugly faces twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards 
 
 muggles whispered hermione in their rightful place come on lets get going 
 
 they joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of dolores umbridge they passed through the gates and into a smaller hall where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts they had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said cattermole 
 
 they looked around harrys stomach turned over one of the death eaters who had witnessed dumbledores death was striding toward them the ministry workers beside them fell silent their eyes downcast harry could feel fear rippling through them 
 
 the mans scowling slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent sweeping robes which were embroidered with much gold thread someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically morning yaxley yaxley ignored them 
 
 i requested somebody from magical maintenance to sort out my office cattermole its still raining in there 
 
 ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene but nobody spoke 
 
 raining in your office thats c thats not good is it 
 
 ron gave a nervous laugh yaxleys eyes widened 
 
 you think its funny cattermole do you 
 
 a pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off 
 
 no said ron no of course c 
 
 you realize that i am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife cattermole in fact im quite surprised youre not down there holding her hand while she waits already given her up as a bad job have you probably wise be sure and marry a pureblood next time 
 
 hermione had let out a little squeak of horror yaxley looked at her she cough feebly and turned away 
 
 i c i c stammered ron 
 
 but if my wife were accused of being a mudblood said yaxley c not that any woman i married would ever be mistaken for such filth c and the head of department of magical law enforcement needed a job doing i would make it my priority to do this job cattermole do you understand me 
 
 yes whispered ron 
 
 then attend to it cattermole and if my office is not completely dry within an hour your wifes blood status will be in even greater doubt than it is now 
 
 the golden grille before them clattered open with a nod and unpleasant smile to harry who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of cattermole yaxley swept away toward another lift harry ron and hermione entered theirs but nobody followed them it was as if they were infectious the grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward 
 
 what am i going to do ron asked the other two at once he looked stricken if i dont turn up my wife i mean cattermoles wife c 
 
 well come with you we should stick together c began harry but ron shook his head feverishly 
 
 thats mental we havent got much time you two find umbridge ill go and sort out yaxleys office c but how do i stop a raining 
 
 try finite incantatem said hermione at once that should stop the rain if its a hex or curse if it doesnt somethings gone wrong with an atmospheric charm which will be more difficult to fix so as an interim measure try impervius to protect his belongings c 
 
 say it again slowly c said ron searching his pockets desperately for a quill but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt a disembodied female voice said level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau and the grilles slid open again admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift 
 
 morning albert said a bushily whiskered man smiling at harry he glanced over at ron and hermione as the lift creaked upward once more hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to ron the wizard leaned toward harry leering and muttering dirk cresswell eh from goblin liaison nice one albert im pretty confident ill get his job now 
 
 he winked harry smiled back hoping that this would suffice the lift stopped the grilles opened once more 
 
 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services said the disembodied witchs voice 
 
 harry saw hermione give ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift followed by the other wizards leaving harry and hermione alone the moment the golden door had closed hermione said very fast actually harry i think id better go after him i dont think he knows what hes doing and if he gets caught the whole thing c 
 
 level one minister of magic and support staff 
 
 the golden grilles slid apart again and hermione gasped four people stood before them two of them deep in conversation a wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold and a squat toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 everything in the right place 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it is more than a hundred years ago at the border of the wood 
 near a large lake stood the old mansion deep ditches surrounded it 
 on every side in which reeds and bulrushes grew close by the 
 drawbridge near the gate there was an old willow tree which bent 
 over the reeds 
 
 from the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the trampling of 
 horses feet therefore a little girl who was watching the geese 
 hastened to drive them away from the bridge before the whole 
 hunting party came galloping up they came however so quickly 
 that the girl in order to avoid being run over placed herself on one 
 of the high of the bridge she was still half a child 
 and very delicately built she had bright blue eyes and a gentle 
 sweet expression but such things the baron did not notice while he 
 was riding past the little he reversed his hunting crop 
 and in rough play gave her such a push with it that she fell 
 backward into the ditch 
 
 everything in the right place he cried into the ditch with 
 you 
 
 then he burst out laughing for that he called fun the others 
 joined in the whole party shouted and cried while the hounds barked 
 
 while the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of the 
 branches of the willow tree by the help of which she held herself 
 over the water and as soon as the baron with his company and the dogs had disappeared through the gate the girl endeavoured to scramble up but the branch broke off and she would have fallen backward among the rushes had not a strong hand from above seized her at this moment it was the hand of a pedlar he had witnessed what had happened from a short distance and now hastened to assist her 
 everything in the right place he said imitating the noble 
 baron and pulling the little maid up to the dry ground he wished 
 to put the branch back in the place it had been broken off but it 
 is not possible to put everything in the right place therefore he 
 stuck the branch into the soft ground 
 
 grow and thrive if you can and produce a good flute for them 
 yonder at the mansion he said it would have given him great 
 pleasure to see the noble baron and his companions well thrashed 
 then he entered the castle but not the banqueting hall he was too 
 humble for that no he went to the servants hall the 
 and maids looked over his stock of articles and bargained with him 
 loud crying and screaming were heard from the table above 
 they called it singing indeed they did their best laughter and 
 the howls of dogs were heard through the open windows there they were feasting and revelling wine and strong old ale were foaming in the glasses and jugs the favourite dogs ate with their masters now and then the squires kissed one of these animals after having wiped its mouth first with the tablecloth they ordered the pedlar to come up but only to make fun of him the wine had got into their heads and reason had left them they poured beer into a stocking that he could drink with them but quick what they called fun and it made them laugh then meadows peasants and farmyards were staked on one card and lost 
 
 everything in the right place the pedlar said when he had at 
 last safely got out of sodom and gomorrah as he called it the 
 open high road is my right place up there i did not feel at ease 
 the little maid who was still watching the geese nodded kindly 
 to him as he passed through the gate 
 
 days and weeks passed and it was seen that the broken 
 which the peddlar had stuck into the ground near the 
 ditch remained fresh and green nay it even put forth fresh twigs 
 the little saw that the branch had taken root and was very 
 pleased the tree so she said was now her tree while the tree was 
 advancing everything else at the castle was going backward through 
 feasting and gambling for these are two rollers upon which nobody 
 stands safely less than six years afterwards the baron passed out 
 of his a poor beggar while the baronial seat had been 
 bought by a rich tradesman he was the very pedlar they had made fun of and poured beer into a stocking for him to drink but honesty and industry bring one forward and now the pedlar was the possessor of the baronial estate from that time forward no was permitted there 
 
 a bad pastime he said when the devil saw the bible for 
 the first time he wanted to produce a caricature in opposition to 
 it and invented 
 
 the new proprietor of the estate took a wife and whom did he 
 take the little who had always remained good and kind 
 and who looked as beautiful in her new clothes as if she had been a 
 lady of high birth and how did all this come about that would be too long a tale to tell in our busy time but it really happened and 
 the most important events have yet to be told 
 
 it was pleasant and cheerful to live in the old place now the 
 mother superintended the household and the father looked after things and they were indeed very prosperous 
 
 where honesty leads the way prosperity is sure to follow the old 
 mansion was repaired and painted the ditches were cleaned and 
 planted all was homely and pleasant and the floors 
 were as white and shining as a pasteboard in the long winter evenings 
 the mistress and her maids sat at the in the large 
 hall every sunday the counsellor this title the pedlar had obtained 
 although only in his old days read aloud a portion from the bible 
 
 the children for they had children all received the best education but they were not all equally clever as is the case in all families 
 
 in the meantime the willow tree near the drawbridge had grown up 
 into a splendid tree and stood there free and was never clipped 
 it is our genealogical tree said the old people to their 
 children and therefore it must be honoured 
 
 a hundred years had elapsed it was in our own days the lake 
 had been transformed into marsh land the whole baronial seat had 
 as it were disappeared a pool of water near some ruined walls was 
 the only remainder of the deep ditches and here stood a magnificent 
 old tree with overhanging branches that was the genealogical tree 
 here it stood and showed how beautiful a willow can look if one 
 does not interfere with it the trunk it is true was cleft in the 
 middle from the root to the crown the storms had bent it a little 
 but it still stood there and out of every crevice and cleft in which 
 wind and weather had carried mould blades of grass and flowers sprang forth especially above where the large boughs parted there was quite a hanging garden in which wild raspberries and ferns throve and even a little mistletoe had taken root and grew gracefully in the old willow branches which were reflected in the 
 dark water beneath when the wind blew the chickweed into the corner of the pool a footpath which led across the fields passed close by the old tree high up on the woody hillside stood the new mansion it had a splendid view and was large and magnificent its window panes were so clear that one might have thought there were none there at all the large flight of steps which led to the entrance looked like a 
 bower covered with roses and plants the lawn was as 
 green as if each blade of grass was cleaned separately morning and 
 evening inside in the hall valuable oil paintings were hanging on 
 the walls here stood chairs and sofas covered with silk and velvet 
 which could be easily rolled about on castors there were tables 
 with polished marble tops and books bound in morocco with gilt edges 
 
 indeed and distinguished people lived here it was the 
 dwelling of the baron and his family each article was in keeping with 
 its surroundings everything in the right place was the motto 
 according to which they also acted here and therefore all the 
 paintings which had once been the honour and glory of the old 
 mansion were now hung up in the passage which led to the servants 
 rooms it was all old lumber especially two portraits one 
 representing a man in a scarlet coat with a wig and the other a 
 lady with powdered and curled hair holding a rose in her hand each of them being surrounded by a large wreath of willow branches both 
 portraits had many holes in them because the sons used the 
 two old people as targets for their crossbows they represented the 
 counsellor and his wife from whom the whole family descended 
 but they did not properly belong to our family said one of the boys he was a pedlar and she kept the geese they were not like papa and mamma the portraits were old lumber and everything in its right place that was why the had been hung up in the passage leading to the servants rooms 
 
 the son of the village pastor was tutor at the mansion one day he 
 went for a walk across the fields with his young pupils and their 
 elder sister who had lately been confirmed they walked along the 
 road which passed by the old willow tree and while they were on the 
 road she picked a bunch of everything in the right 
 place and indeed the bunch looked very beautiful at the same time 
 she listened to all that was said and she very much liked to hear the 
 son speak about the elements and of the great men and women in history she had a healthy mind noble in thought and deed and with a heart full of love for everything that god had created they 
 stopped at the old willow tree as the youngest of the sons 
 wished very much to have a flute from it such as had been cut for him from other willow trees the son broke a branch off 
 oh pray do not do it said the young lady but it was already done 
 that is our famous old tree i love it very much they often laugh at 
 me at home about it but that does not matter there is a story 
 attached to this tree and now she told him all that we already 
 know about the tree the old mansion the pedlar and the 
 who had met there for the first time and had become the ancestors 
 of the noble family to which the young lady belonged 
 
 they did not like to be knighted the good old people she said 
 their motto was everything in the right place and it would not 
 be right they thought to purchase a title for money my grandfather 
 the first baron was their son they say he was a very learned man 
 a great favourite with the princes and princesses and was invited 
 to all court festivities the others at home love him best but i 
 do not know why there seemed to me to be something about the old 
 couple that attracts my heart how homely how patriarchal it must 
 have been in the old mansion where the mistress sat at the 
 with her maids while her husband read aloud out of the bible 
 
 they must have been excellent sensible people said the 
 son and with this the conversation turned naturally to 
 noblemen and commoners from the manner in which the tutor spoke about the significance of being noble it seemed almost as if he did not belong to a family 
 
 it is good fortune to be of a family who have distinguished 
 themselves and to possess as it were a spur in oneself to advance 
 to all that is good it is a splendid thing to belong to a noble 
 family whose name serves as a card of admission to the highest 
 circles nobility is a distinction it is a gold coin that bears the 
 stamp of its own value it is the fallacy of the time and many 
 poets express it to say that all that is noble is bad and stupid and 
 that on the contrary the lower one goes among the poor the more 
 brilliant virtues one finds i do not share this opinion for it is 
 wrong in the upper classes one sees many touchingly beautiful traits 
 my own mother has told me of such and i could mention several 
 one day she was visiting a house in town my grandmother i believe had been the nurse when she was a child my mother and the nobleman were alone in the room when he suddenly noticed an old woman on crutches come limping into the courtyard she came every sunday to carry a gift away with her 
 
 there is the poor old woman said the nobleman it is so 
 difficult for her to walk 
 
 my mother had hardly understood what he said before he 
 disappeared from the room and went downstairs in order to save her 
 the troublesome walk for the gift she came to fetch of course this is 
 only a little incident but it has its good sound like the poor 
 two mites in the bible the sound which echoes in the depth of every human heart and this is what the poet ought to show and point out more especially in our own time he ought to sing of this it does good it mitigates and reconciles but when a man simply because he is of noble birth and possesses a genealogy stands on his hind legs and neighs in the street like an arabian horse and says when a commoner has been in a room some people from the street have been here there nobility is decaying it has become a mask of the kind that thespis created and it is amusing when such a person is 
 exposed in satire 
 
 such was the speech it was a little long but while he 
 delivered it he had finished cutting the flute 
 
 there was a large party at the mansion many guests from the 
 neighbourhood and from the capital had arrived there were ladies with tasteful and with tasteless dresses the big hall was quite crowded with people the clergymen stood humbly together in a corner and looked as if they were preparing for a funeral but it was a the amusement had not yet begun a great concert was to take place and that is why the young son had brought his willow 
 flute with him but he could not make it sound nor could his 
 father and therefore the flute was good for nothing 
 there was music and songs of the kind which delight most those 
 that perform them otherwise quite charming 
 are you an artist said a cavalier the son of his father 
 you play on the flute you have made it yourself it is genius that 
 rules the place of honour is due to you 
 certainly not i only advance with the time and that of course 
 one help 
 
 i hope you will delight us all with the little instrument will 
 you not thus saying he handed to the tutor the flute which had 
 been cut from the willow tree by the pool and then announced in a 
 loud voice that the tutor wished to perform a solo on the flute 
 
 they wished to tease him that was evident and therefore the tutor 
 declined to play although he could do so very well they urged and 
 requested him however so long that at last he took up the flute and 
 placed it to his lips 
 
 that was a marvellous flute its sound was as thrilling as the 
 whistle of a steam engine in fact it was much stronger for it 
 sounded and was heard in the yard in the garden in the wood and 
 many miles round in the country at the same time a storm rose and 
 roared everything in the right place and with this the baron as 
 if carried by the wind flew out of the hall straight into the 
 cottage and the shepherd flew not into the hall 
 thither he could not come but into the servants hall among the 
 smart footmen who were striding about in silk stockings these haughty menials looked that such a person ventured to sit at table with them but in the hall the daughter flew to the 
 place of honour at the end of the table she was worthy to sit 
 there the son had the seat next to her the two sat there as 
 if they were a bridal pair an old count belonging to one of the 
 oldest families of the country remained untouched in his place of 
 honour the flute was just and it is duty to be so the 
 cavalier who had caused the flute to be played and 
 who was the child of his parents flew headlong into the 
 but not he alone 
 
 the flute was heard at the distance of a mile and strange 
 events took place a rich family who were driving in a coach and four were blown out of it and could not even find room behind it with their footmen two rich farmers who had in our days shot up higher than their own were flung into the ditch it was a dangerous flute fortunately it burst at the first sound and that was a good thing for then it was put back into its pocket its right place 
 
 the next day nobody spoke a word about what had taken place thus 
 originated the phrase to pocket the flute everything was again 
 in its usual order except that the two old pictures of the peddlar 
 and the were hanging in the there they 
 were on the wall as if blown up there and as a real expert said 
 that they were painted by a hand they remained there and 
 were restored everything in the right place and to this it will 
 come eternity is long much longer indeed than this story

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 everything in the right place 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it is more than a hundred years ago at the border of the wood 
 near a large lake stood the old mansion deep ditches surrounded it 
 on every side in which reeds and bulrushes grew close by the 
 drawbridge near the gate there was an old willow tree which bent 
 over the reeds 
 
 from the narrow pass came the sound of bugles and the trampling of 
 horses feet therefore a little girl who was watching the geese 
 hastened to drive them away from the bridge before the whole 
 hunting party came galloping up they came however so quickly 
 that the girl in order to avoid being run over placed herself on one 
 of the high of the bridge she was still half a child 
 and very delicately built she had bright blue eyes and a gentle 
 sweet expression but such things the baron did not notice while he 
 was riding past the little he reversed his hunting crop 
 and in rough play gave her such a push with it that she fell 
 backward into the ditch 
 
 everything in the right place he cried into the ditch with 
 you 
 
 then he burst out laughing for that he called fun the others 
 joined in the whole party shouted and cried while the hounds barked 
 
 while the poor girl was falling she happily caught one of the 
 branches of the willow tree by the help of which she held herself 
 over the water and as soon as the baron with his company and the dogs had disappeared through the gate the girl endeavoured to scramble up but the branch broke off and she would have fallen backward among the rushes had not a strong hand from above seized her at this moment it was the hand of a pedlar he had witnessed what had happened from a short distance and now hastened to assist her 
 everything in the right place he said imitating the noble 
 baron and pulling the little maid up to the dry ground he wished 
 to put the branch back in the place it had been broken off but it 
 is not possible to put everything in the right place therefore he 
 stuck the branch into the soft ground 
 
 grow and thrive if you can and produce a good flute for them 
 yonder at the mansion he said it would have given him great 
 pleasure to see the noble baron and his companions well thrashed 
 then he entered the castle but not the banqueting hall he was too 
 humble for that no he went to the servants hall the 
 and maids looked over his stock of articles and bargained with him 
 loud crying and screaming were heard from the table above 
 they called it singing indeed they did their best laughter and 
 the howls of dogs were heard through the open windows there they were feasting and revelling wine and strong old ale were foaming in the glasses and jugs the favourite dogs ate with their masters now and then the squires kissed one of these animals after having wiped its mouth first with the tablecloth they ordered the pedlar to come up but only to make fun of him the wine had got into their heads and reason had left them they poured beer into a stocking that he could drink with them but quick what they called fun and it made them laugh then meadows peasants and farmyards were staked on one card and lost 
 
 everything in the right place the pedlar said when he had at 
 last safely got out of sodom and gomorrah as he called it the 
 open high road is my right place up there i did not feel at ease 
 the little maid who was still watching the geese nodded kindly 
 to him as he passed through the gate 
 
 days and weeks passed and it was seen that the broken 
 which the peddlar had stuck into the ground near the 
 ditch remained fresh and green nay it even put forth fresh twigs 
 the little saw that the branch had taken root and was very 
 pleased the tree so she said was now her tree while the tree was 
 advancing everything else at the castle was going backward through 
 feasting and gambling for these are two rollers upon which nobody 
 stands safely less than six years afterwards the baron passed out 
 of his a poor beggar while the baronial seat had been 
 bought by a rich tradesman he was the very pedlar they had made fun of and poured beer into a stocking for him to drink but honesty and industry bring one forward and now the pedlar was the possessor of the baronial estate from that time forward no was permitted there 
 
 a bad pastime he said when the devil saw the bible for 
 the first time he wanted to produce a caricature in opposition to 
 it and invented 
 
 the new proprietor of the estate took a wife and whom did he 
 take the little who had always remained good and kind 
 and who looked as beautiful in her new clothes as if she had been a 
 lady of high birth and how did all this come about that would be too long a tale to tell in our busy time but it really happened and 
 the most important events have yet to be told 
 
 it was pleasant and cheerful to live in the old place now the 
 mother superintended the household and the father looked after things and they were indeed very prosperous 
 
 where honesty leads the way prosperity is sure to follow the old 
 mansion was repaired and painted the ditches were cleaned and 
 planted all was homely and pleasant and the floors 
 were as white and shining as a pasteboard in the long winter evenings 
 the mistress and her maids sat at the in the large 
 hall every sunday the counsellor this title the pedlar had obtained 
 although only in his old days read aloud a portion from the bible 
 
 the children for they had children all received the best education but they were not all equally clever as is the case in all families 
 
 in the meantime the willow tree near the drawbridge had grown up 
 into a splendid tree and stood there free and was never clipped 
 it is our genealogical tree said the old people to their 
 children and therefore it must be honoured 
 
 a hundred years had elapsed it was in our own days the lake 
 had been transformed into marsh land the whole baronial seat had 
 as it were disappeared a pool of water near some ruined walls was 
 the only remainder of the deep ditches and here stood a magnificent 
 old tree with overhanging branches that was the genealogical tree 
 here it stood and showed how beautiful a willow can look if one 
 does not interfere with it the trunk it is true was cleft in the 
 middle from the root to the crown the storms had bent it a little 
 but it still stood there and out of every crevice and cleft in which 
 wind and weather had carried mould blades of grass and flowers sprang forth especially above where the large boughs parted there was quite a hanging garden in which wild raspberries and ferns throve and even a little mistletoe had taken root and grew gracefully in the old willow branches which were reflected in the 
 dark water beneath when the wind blew the chickweed into the corner of the pool a footpath which led across the fields passed close by the old tree high up on the woody hillside stood the new mansion it had a splendid view and was large and magnificent its window panes were so clear that one might have thought there were none there at all the large flight of steps which led to the entrance looked like a 
 bower covered with roses and plants the lawn was as 
 green as if each blade of grass was cleaned separately morning and 
 evening inside in the hall valuable oil paintings were hanging on 
 the walls here stood chairs and sofas covered with silk and velvet 
 which could be easily rolled about on castors there were tables 
 with polished marble tops and books bound in morocco with gilt edges 
 
 indeed and distinguished people lived here it was the 
 dwelling of the baron and his family each article was in keeping with 
 its surroundings everything in the right place was the motto 
 according to which they also acted here and therefore all the 
 paintings which had once been the honour and glory of the old 
 mansion were now hung up in the passage which led to the servants 
 rooms it was all old lumber especially two portraits one 
 representing a man in a scarlet coat with a wig and the other a 
 lady with powdered and curled hair holding a rose in her hand each of them being surrounded by a large wreath of willow branches both 
 portraits had many holes in them because the sons used the 
 two old people as targets for their crossbows they represented the 
 counsellor and his wife from whom the whole family descended 
 but they did not properly belong to our family said one of the boys he was a pedlar and she kept the geese they were not like papa and mamma the portraits were old lumber and everything in its right place that was why the had been hung up in the passage leading to the servants rooms 
 
 the son of the village pastor was tutor at the mansion one day he 
 went for a walk across the fields with his young pupils and their 
 elder sister who had lately been confirmed they walked along the 
 road which passed by the old willow tree and while they were on the 
 road she picked a bunch of everything in the right 
 place and indeed the bunch looked very beautiful at the same time 
 she listened to all that was said and she very much liked to hear the 
 son speak about the elements and of the great men and women in history she had a healthy mind noble in thought and deed and with a heart full of love for everything that god had created they 
 stopped at the old willow tree as the youngest of the sons 
 wished very much to have a flute from it such as had been cut for him from other willow trees the son broke a branch off 
 oh pray do not do it said the young lady but it was already done 
 that is our famous old tree i love it very much they often laugh at 
 me at home about it but that does not matter there is a story 
 attached to this tree and now she told him all that we already 
 know about the tree the old mansion the pedlar and the 
 who had met there for the first time and had become the ancestors 
 of the noble family to which the young lady belonged 
 
 they did not like to be knighted the good old people she said 
 their motto was everything in the right place and it would not 
 be right they thought to purchase a title for money my grandfather 
 the first baron was their son they say he was a very learned man 
 a great favourite with the princes and princesses and was invited 
 to all court festivities the others at home love him best but i 
 do not know why there seemed to me to be something about the old 
 couple that attracts my heart how homely how patriarchal it must 
 have been in the old mansion where the mistress sat at the 
 with her maids while her husband read aloud out of the bible 
 
 they must have been excellent sensible people said the 
 son and with this the conversation turned naturally to 
 noblemen and commoners from the manner in which the tutor spoke about the significance of being noble it seemed almost as if he did not belong to a family 
 
 it is good fortune to be of a family who have distinguished 
 themselves and to possess as it were a spur in oneself to advance 
 to all that is good it is a splendid thing to belong to a noble 
 family whose name serves as a card of admission to the highest 
 circles nobility is a distinction it is a gold coin that bears the 
 stamp of its own value it is the fallacy of the time and many 
 poets express it to say that all that is noble is bad and stupid and 
 that on the contrary the lower one goes among the poor the more 
 brilliant virtues one finds i do not share this opinion for it is 
 wrong in the upper classes one sees many touchingly beautiful traits 
 my own mother has told me of such and i could mention several 
 one day she was visiting a house in town my grandmother i believe had been the nurse when she was a child my mother and the nobleman were alone in the room when he suddenly noticed an old woman on crutches come limping into the courtyard she came every sunday to carry a gift away with her 
 
 there is the poor old woman said the nobleman it is so

 origin of the perpetual adoration 
 however this almost sepulchral parlor of which we have sought to convey an idea is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents 
 at the convent of the rue du temple in particular which belonged in truth to another order the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames a portrait of a benedictine nun with unveiled face painted bouquets and even the head of a turk 
 it is in that garden of the temple convent that stood that famous which was renowned as the finest and the largest in france and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm 
 as we have said this convent of the temple was occupied by benedictines of the perpetual adoration benedictines quite different from those who depended on citeaux 
 this order of the perpetual adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years in the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart in two churches in paris at and at en greve a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar 
 m the prior and of des pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy in which the nuncio officiated 
 but this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women madame courtin marquise de boucs and the comtesse de chateauvieux 
 this outrage committed on the most holy sacrament of the altar though but temporary would not depart from these holy souls and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a perpetual adoration in some female monastery both of them one in the other in made donations of notable sums to mother catherine de bar called of the holy sacrament a benedictine nun for the purpose of founding to this pious end a monastery of the order of the first permission for this foundation was given to mother catherine de bar by m de metz abbe of on condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income which amounts to six thousand livres to the principal after the abbe of the king accorded and all the rest abbatial charter and royal letters was confirmed in by the chamber of accounts and the parliament

 their first convent was a new building in the rue cassette out of the contributions of mesdames de boucs and de chateauvieux 
 this order as it will be seen was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of citeaux

 chapter xxv 
 
 during that year after his departure prince nicholas health and temper became much worse he grew still more irritable and it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible princess mary had two passions and consequently two joys her nephew little nicholas and religion and these were the favorite subjects of the attacks and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of children you want to make him little nicholas into an old maid like yourself a pity prince andrew wants a son and not an old maid he would say or turning to mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her in princess presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them 
 he continually hurt princess feelings and tormented her but it cost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward her or could her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust and what is justice the princess never thought of that proud word justice all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law the law of love and taught us by him who lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure and love and that she did 
 during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gay gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said nothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk with his father about something and princess mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another 
 soon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friend julie karagina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream of marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother killed in turkey 
 sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie 
 your loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a special providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and your excellent mother oh my friend religion and religion alone can i will not say comfort us but save us from despair religion alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others are called away to god while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a burden to themselves and to others are left living the first death i saw and one i shall never forget that of my dear left that impression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die so i asked why that angel lise who not only never wronged anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to die and what do you think dear friend five years have passed since then and already i with my petty understanding begin to see clearly why she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the creator whose every action though generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinite love for his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a duties as a young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so as a mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly prince andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of her alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at the moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me i should then have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear and certain i write all this to you dear friend only to convince you of the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not a single hair of our heads will fall without his will and his will is governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is for our good 
 you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte the case is this my health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as you know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure the notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but from my remarks and his talks with michael ivanovich i know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on buonaparte who only at bald hills in the whole world it seems is not accepted as a great man still less as emperor of france and my father cannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable in any case it will be decided very shortly 
 our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother absence he as i wrote you before has changed very much of late after his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits he has again become as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that heart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to me that life is not over for him but together with this mental change he has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more nervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active cultivated and capable of the young men forgive my vanity as a relation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybody here from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on his arrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at the way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as that you write about i mean the report of my betrothal to the little rostova i do not think my brother will ever marry again and certainly not her and this is why first i know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother secondly because as far as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew i do not think he would choose her for a wife and frankly i do not wish it but i am running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet my dear friend may god keep you in his holy and mighty care my dear friend mademoiselle bourienne sends you kisses 
 mary

 during that year after his departure prince nicholas health and temper became much worse he grew still more irritable and it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible princess mary had two passions and consequently two joys her nephew little nicholas and religion and these were the favorite subjects of the attacks and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of children you want to make him little nicholas into an old maid like yourself a pity prince andrew wants a son and not an old maid he would say or turning to mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her in princess presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them 
 he continually hurt princess feelings and tormented her but it cost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward her or could her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust and what is justice the princess never thought of that proud word justice all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law the law of love and taught us by him who lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure and love and that she did 
 during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gay gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said nothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk with his father about something and princess mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another 
 soon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friend julie karagina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream of marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother killed in turkey 
 sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie 
 your loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a special providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and your excellent mother oh my friend religion and religion alone can i will not say comfort us but save us from despair religion alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others are called away to god while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a burden to themselves and to others are left living the first death i saw and one i shall never forget that of my dear left that impression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die so i asked why that angel lise who not only never wronged anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to die and what do you think dear friend five years have passed since then and already i with my petty understanding begin to see clearly why she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the creator whose every action though generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinite love for his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a duties as a young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so as a mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly prince andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of her alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at the moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me i should then have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear and certain i write all this to you dear friend only to convince you of the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not a single hair of our heads will fall without his will and his will is governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is for our good 
 you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte the case is this my health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as you know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure the notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but from my remarks and his talks with michael ivanovich i know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on buonaparte who only at bald hills in the whole world it seems is not accepted as a great man still less as emperor of france and my father cannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable in any case it will be decided very shortly 
 our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother absence he as i wrote you before has changed very much of late after his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits he has again become as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that heart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to me that life is not over for him but together with this mental change he has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more nervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active cultivated and capable of the young men forgive my vanity as a relation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybody here from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on his arrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at the way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as that you write about i mean the report of my betrothal to the little rostova i do not think my brother will ever marry again and certainly not her and this is why first i know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother secondly because as far as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew i do not think he would choose her for a wife and frankly i do not wish it but i am running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet my dear friend may god keep you in his holy and mighty care my dear friend mademoiselle bourienne sends you kisses

 the convent as an abstract idea 
 this book is a drama whose leading personage is the infinite 
 man is the second 
 such being the case and a convent having happened to be on our road it has been our duty to enter it 
 why 
 because the convent which is common to the orient as well as to the occident to antiquity as well as to modern times to paganism to buddhism to mahometanism as well as to christianity is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the infinite 
 this is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain ideas nevertheless while absolutely maintaining our reserves our restrictions and even our indignations we must say that every time we encounter man in the infinite either well or ill understood we feel ourselves overpowered with respect there is in the synagogue in the mosque in the pagoda in the wigwam a hideous side which we execrate and a sublime side which we adore 
 what a contemplation for the mind and what endless food for thought is the reverberation of god upon the human wall

 in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter from prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and surprising news he informed her of his engagement to natasha rostova the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister he wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life was he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited bald hills though he had spoken of it to his father he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask her father to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his displeasure without attaining her object besides he wrote the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now my father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months half of that period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever if the doctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in russia but as it is i have to postpone my return for three months you know me and my relations with father i want nothing from him i have been and always shall be independent but to go against his will and arouse his anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time would destroy half my happiness i am now writing to him about the same question and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months 
 after long hesitations doubts and prayers princess mary gave the letter to her father the next day the old prince said to her quietly 
 write and tell your brother to wait till i am dead it be long i shall soon set him free 
 the princess was about to reply but her father would not let her speak and raising his voice more and more cried 
 marry marry my boy a good family clever people eh rich eh yes a nice stepmother little nicholas will have write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little nicholas stepmother and marry bourienne ha ha ha he be without a stepmother either only one thing no more women are wanted in my house let him marry and live by himself perhaps you will go and live with him too he added turning to princess mary go in heavens name go out into the frost the frost the frost 
 after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter but repressed vexation at his behavior found expression in his treatment of his daughter to his former pretexts for irony a fresh one was now added allusions to stepmothers and amiabilities to mademoiselle bourienne 
 why i marry her he asked his daughter make a splendid princess 
 and latterly to her surprise and bewilderment princess mary noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the frenchwoman she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his letter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea 
 little nicholas and his education her brother andrew and religion were princess joys and consolations but besides that since everyone must have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of her life this comforting dream and hope were given her by folk the and other pilgrims who visited her without the knowledge the longer she lived the more experience and observation she had of life the greater was her wonder at the of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth toiling suffering struggling and harming one another to obtain that impossible visionary sinful happiness prince andrew had loved his wife she died but that was not enough he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls their eternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant not only do we know this ourselves but christ the son of god came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it how is it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no one except these despised folk who wallet on back come to me by the back door afraid of being seen by the prince not for fear of by him but for fear of causing him to sin to leave family home and all the cares of worldly welfare in order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name doing no one any harm but praying for all for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth 
 there was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called theodosia who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn heavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her once when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon theodosia was talking of her life the thought that theodosia alone had found the true path of life suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone to sleep princess mary thought about this for a long time and at last made up her mind that strange as it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage she disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor father akinfi the monk and he approved of her intention under guise of a present for the pilgrims princess mary prepared a complete costume for herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchief often approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure princess mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already come to put her project into execution 
 often listening to the pilgrims tales she was so stimulated by their simple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running away from home in imagination she already pictured herself by side dressed in coarse rags walking with a staff a wallet on her back along the dusty road directing her wanderings from one shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire and reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing but eternal joy and bliss 
 i shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to get used to it or getting to love it i shall go farther i will go on till my legs fail and lie down and die somewhere and shall at last reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor sighing thought princess mary 
 but afterwards when she saw her father and especially little koko nicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god

 book seven 
 chapter i 
 
 the bible legend tells us that the absence of labor idleness was a condition of the first blessedness before the fall fallen man has retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty he would have found one of the conditions of primitive blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class the military the chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness

 rostov had become a bluff fellow whom his moscow acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked and respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well contented with his life of late in he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents 
 reading these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which protected from all the entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he felt that sooner or later he would have to that whirlpool of life with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts with stewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with love and his promise to her it was all dreadfully difficult and complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters in french beginning my dear mamma and ending your obedient son which said nothing of when he would return in he received letters from his parents in which they told him of engagement to bolkonski and that the wedding would be in a time because the old prince made difficulties this letter grieved and mortified nicholas in the first place he was sorry that natasha for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to the home and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow bolkonski that connection with him was no such great honor after all and that if he loved natasha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see natasha before she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerations about sonya and about the confusion of their affairs and nicholas again put it off but in the spring of that year he received a letter from his mother written without his knowledge and that letter persuaded him to return she wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging the count was so weak and trusted mitenka so much and was so that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse for sake i implore you come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched wrote the countess 
 this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a man which showed him what he ought to do 
 the right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate to go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after his nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when he returned with the horse all in a lather he informed lavrushka servant who had remained with him and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff and this interested him extremely whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the order of st anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polish count golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rostov had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polish mademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take place without him he knew he must go away from this good bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused a week later he obtained his leave his hussar comrades not only those of his own regiment but the whole brigade gave rostov a dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two bands and two choirs of singers rostov danced the trepak with major basov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped rostov the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station

 chapter i 
 
 the bible legend tells us that the absence of labor idleness was a condition of the first blessedness before the fall fallen man has retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty he would have found one of the conditions of primitive blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class the military the chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness 
 nicholas rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full when after he continued to serve in the pavlograd regiment in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from denisov

 robber ungrateful wretch hack the dog to pieces not my father robbing us and so on 
 then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red in the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mitenka out by the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to him behind with great agility at convenient moments between the words shouting be off never let me see your face here again you villain 
 mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the shrubbery this shrubbery was a haven of refuge for culprits at otradnoe mitenka himself returning tipsy from the town used to hide there and many of the residents at otradnoe hiding from mitenka knew of its protective qualities 
 wife and thrust their heads and frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and where the high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt 
 the young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by with resolute strides and went into the house 
 the countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement might have on her son she went several times to his door on tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another 
 next day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassed smile said to him

 the convent from the point of view of principles 
 men unite themselves and dwell in communities 
 by virtue of what right by virtue of the right of association 
 they shut themselves up at home 
 by virtue of what right by virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door 
 they do not come forth 
 by virtue of what right 
 by virtue of the right to go and come which implies the right to remain at home 
 there at home what do they do 
 they speak in low tones they drop their eyes they toil they renounce the world towns sensualities pleasures vanities pride interests 
 they are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever on entering there each one who was rich makes himself poor what he has he gives to all 
 he who was what is called noble a gentleman and a lord is the equal of him who was a peasant the cell is identical for all 
 all undergo the same tonsure wear the same frock eat the same black bread sleep on the same straw die on the same ashes 
 the same sack on their backs the same rope around their loins 
 if the decision has been to go barefoot all go barefoot 
 there may be a prince among them that prince is the same shadow as the rest 
 no titles 
 even family names have disappeared 
 they bear only first names 
 all are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names 
 they have dissolved the carnal family and constituted in their community a spiritual family they have no other relatives than all men 
 they succor the poor they care for the sick 
 they elect those whom they obey 
 they call each other my brother 
 you stop me and exclaim but that is the ideal convent 
 it is sufficient that it may be the possible convent that i should take notice of it 
 thence it results that in the preceding book i have spoken of a convent with respectful accents 
 the middle ages cast aside asia cast aside the historical and political question held in reserve from the purely philosophical point of view outside the requirements of militant policy on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties i shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive and in some respects a deferential gravity 
 wherever there is a community there is a commune where there is a commune there is right 
 the monastery is the product of the formula 
 equality fraternity 
 oh how grand is liberty and what a splendid transfiguration 
 liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic 
 let us continue 
 but these men or these women who are behind these four walls they dress themselves in coarse woollen they are equals they call each other brothers that is well but they do something else 
 yes 
 what 
 they gaze on the darkness they kneel and they clasp their hands 
 what does this signify

 men unite themselves and dwell in communities 
 by virtue of what right by virtue of the right of association 
 they shut themselves up at home 
 by virtue of what right by virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door 
 they do not come forth 
 by virtue of what right 
 by virtue of the right to go and come which implies the right to remain at home 
 there at home what do they do 
 they speak in low tones they drop their eyes they toil they renounce the world towns sensualities pleasures vanities pride interests 
 they are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever on entering there each one who was rich makes himself poor what he has he gives to all 
 he who was what is called noble a gentleman and a lord is the equal of him who was a peasant the cell is identical for all 
 all undergo the same tonsure wear the same frock eat the same black bread sleep on the same straw die on the same ashes 
 the same sack on their backs the same rope around their loins 
 if the decision has been to go barefoot all go barefoot 
 there may be a prince among them that prince is the same shadow as the rest 
 no titles 
 even family names have disappeared 
 they bear only first names 
 all are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names 
 they have dissolved the carnal family and constituted in their community a spiritual family they have no other relatives than all men 
 they succor the poor they care for the sick 
 they elect those whom they obey 
 they call each other my brother 
 you stop me and exclaim but that is the ideal convent 
 it is sufficient that it may be the possible convent that i should take notice of it 
 thence it results that in the preceding book i have spoken of a convent with respectful accents 
 the middle ages cast aside asia cast aside the historical and political question held in reserve from the purely philosophical point of view outside the requirements of militant policy on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties i shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive and in some respects a deferential gravity 
 wherever there is a community there is a commune where there is a commune there is right 
 the monastery is the product of the formula 
 equality fraternity 
 oh how grand is liberty and what a splendid transfiguration 
 liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic 
 let us continue 
 but these men or these women who are behind these four walls they dress themselves in coarse woollen they are equals they call each other brothers that is well but they do something else 
 yes 
 what 
 they gaze on the darkness they kneel and they clasp their hands 
 what does this signify

 the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains the verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle and against the stubble of the spring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of august had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had become golden and islands amid the green winter rye the hares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs were beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs it was the best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that ardent young sportsman rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition but were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three days rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on a distant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs 
 all that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air was sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw on the fifteenth when young rostov in his dressing gown looked out of the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind the only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopic particles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch there was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog milka a bitch with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched her hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog catching sight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himself against his legs 
 came at that moment that inimitable call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the corner came daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead ukrainian fashion a long bent whip in his hand and that look of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed his circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully this scorn was not offensive to his master nicholas knew that this daniel disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them was all the same his serf and huntsman 
 daniel nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weather the hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress 
 what orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass deep as a and hoarse with hallooing and two flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent can you resist it those eyes seemed to be asking 
 a good day eh for a hunt and a gallop eh asked nicholas scratching milka behind the ears 
 daniel did not answer but winked instead 
 i sent uvarka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a pause he says moved them into the otradnoe enclosure they were howling there this meant that the about whom they both knew had moved with her cubs to the otradnoe copse a small place a mile and a half from the house 
 we ought to go you think so said nicholas come to me with uvarka 
 as you please 
 then put off feeding them 
 yes sir 
 five minutes later daniel and uvarka were standing in nicholas big study though daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human life daniel himself felt this and as usual stood just inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear of breaking something in the apartment and he hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into the open under the sky once more 
 having finished his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion that the hounds were fit daniel himself wished to go hunting nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to go natasha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old big shawl wrapped round her petya ran in at the same time 
 you are going asked natasha i knew you would sonya said you go but i knew that today is the sort of day when you help going 
 yes we are going replied nicholas reluctantly for today as he intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take natasha and petya we are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for you 
 you know it is my greatest pleasure said natasha not fair you are going by yourself are having the horses saddled and said nothing to us about it 
 no barrier bars a path go shouted petya 
 but you mamma said you said nicholas to natasha 
 yes go i shall certainly go said natasha decisively daniel tell them to saddle for us and michael must come with my dogs she added to the huntsman 
 it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible he cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young lady

 chapter iv 
 
 the old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his care being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of september prepared to go out with the others 
 in an time the whole hunting party was at the porch nicholas with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to trifles went past natasha and petya who were trying to tell him something he had a look at all the details of the hunt sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted his chestnut donets and whistling to his own leash of borzois set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the otradnoe wood the old horse a sorrel gelding called viflyanka was led by the groom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him 
 they were taking hounds with six hunt attendants and besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen and more than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash belonging to members of the family there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty horsemen 
 each dog knew its master and its call each man in the hunt knew his business his place what he had to do as soon as they had passed the fence they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk along the road and field leading to the otradnoe covert 
 the horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet now and then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road the misty sky still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the air was still warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a huntsman the snort of a horse the crack of a whip or the whine of a straggling hound could be heard 
 when they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders with dogs appeared out of the mist approaching the rostovs in front rode a handsome old man with a large gray mustache 
 good morning uncle said nicholas when the old man drew near 
 it come on i was sure of it began uncle he was a distant relative of the rostovs a man of small means and their neighbor i knew you be able to resist it and a good thing going it come on this was favorite expression take the covert at once for my girchik says the ilagins are at korniki with their hounds it come on take the cubs from under your very nose 
 where going shall we join up our packs asked nicholas 
 the hounds were joined into one pack and uncle and nicholas rode on side by side natasha muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes galloped up to them she was followed by petya who always kept close to her by michael a huntsman and by a groom appointed to look after her petya who was laughing whipped and pulled at his horse natasha sat easily and confidently on her black arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand 
 uncle looked round disapprovingly at petya and natasha he did not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting 
 good morning uncle we are going too shouted petya 
 good morning good morning but go overriding the hounds said uncle sternly 
 nicholas what a fine dog trunila is he knew me said natasha referring to her favorite hound 
 in the first place trunila is not a dog but a harrier thought nicholas and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment natasha understood it 
 you think be in way uncle she said go to our places and budge 
 a good thing too little countess said uncle only mind you fall off your horse he added because it come on nothing to hold on to 
 the oasis of the otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off the huntsmen were already nearing it rostov having finally settled with uncle where they should set on the hounds and having shown natasha where she was to stand a spot where nothing could possibly run out went round above the ravine 
 well nephew going for a big wolf said uncle mind and let her slip 
 as may happen answered rostov karay here he shouted answering remark by this call to his borzoi karay was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided they all took up their places 
 the old count knowing his ardor in the hunt hurried so as not to be late and the hunstmen had not yet reached their places when count ilya rostov cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him where a wolf might come out having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn he mounted his good sleek and comfortable horse viflyanka which was turning gray like himself his horses and trap were sent home count ilya rostov though not at heart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand arranged his reins settled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was ready looked about with a smile 
 beside him was simon chekmar his personal attendant an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle chekmar held in leash three formidable wolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master and his horse two wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred paces farther along the edge of the wood stood mitka the other groom a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds before the hunt by old custom the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy taken a snack and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite bordeaux 
 he was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes were rather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddle wrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for an outing 
 the thin chekmar having got everything ready kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat a third person rode up circumspectly through the wood it was plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the count this person was a old man in a cloak with a tall peaked cap on his head he was the buffoon who went by a name nastasya ivanovna 
 well nastasya ivanovna whispered the count winking at him if you scare away the beast give it you 
 i know a thing or two myself said nastasya ivanovna 
 hush whispered the count and turned to simon have you seen the young countess he asked where is she 
 with young count peter by the zharov rank grass answered simon smiling though a lady very fond of hunting 
 and surprised at the way she rides simon eh said the count as good as many a man 
 of course marvelous so bold so easy 
 and nicholas where is he by the lyadov upland he 
 yes sir he knows where to stand he understands the matter so well that daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well knowing what would please his master 
 rides well eh and how well he looks on his horse eh 
 a perfect picture how he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the zavarzinsk thicket the other day leaped a fearful place what a sight when they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price yes one would have to search far to find another as smart 
 to search far repeated the count evidently sorry simon had not said more to search far he said turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox 
 the other day when he came out from mass in full uniform michael sidorych simon did not finish for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue he bent down his head and listened shaking a warning finger at his master they are on the scent of the cubs he whispered straight to the lyadov uplands 
 the count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked into the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from hunting horn the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf the no longer set on the hounds but changed to the cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose voice now a deep bass now piercingly shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field 
 after listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the sound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in the distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and it was with this that voice was heard calling ulyulyu the sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming more distant 
 simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand opened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood the count started and dropped the snuffbox nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up the count and simon were looking at him 
 then unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly approached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them 
 the count turned and saw on his right mitka staring at him with eyes starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to the other side 
 look out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had long fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped toward the count 
 the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing the angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses feet at the wolf 
 the wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly like a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from side to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same instant with a cry like a wail first one hound then another and then another sprang from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and chestnut horse appeared dark with sweat on its long back sat daniel hunched forward capless his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring face 
 ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the count his eyes flashed lightning 
 blast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the count 
 let the wolf go what sportsmen and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punished schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win sympathy for his plight but simon was no longer there he was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to head the wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so

 with young count peter by the zharov rank grass answered simon smiling though a lady very fond of hunting 
 and surprised at the way she rides simon eh said the count as good as many a man 
 of course marvelous so bold so easy 
 and nicholas where is he by the lyadov upland he 
 yes sir he knows where to stand he understands the matter so well that daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well knowing what would please his master 
 rides well eh and how well he looks on his horse eh 
 a perfect picture how he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the zavarzinsk thicket the other day leaped a fearful place what a sight when they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price yes one would have to search far to find another as smart 
 to search far repeated the count evidently sorry simon had not said more to search far he said turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox 
 the other day when he came out from mass in full uniform michael sidorych simon did not finish for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue he bent down his head and listened shaking a warning finger at his master they are on the scent of the cubs he whispered straight to the lyadov uplands 
 the count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked into the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from hunting horn the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf the no longer set on the hounds but changed to the cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose voice now a deep bass now piercingly shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field 
 after listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the sound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in the distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and it was with this that voice was heard calling ulyulyu the sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming more distant 
 simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand opened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood the count started and dropped the snuffbox nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up the count and simon were looking at him 
 then unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly approached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them 
 the count turned and saw on his right mitka staring at him with eyes starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to the other side 
 look out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had long fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped toward the count 
 the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing the angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses feet at the wolf 
 the wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly like a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from side to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same instant with a cry like a wail first one hound then another and then another sprang from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and chestnut horse appeared dark with sweat on its long back sat daniel hunched forward capless his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring face 
 ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the count his eyes flashed lightning 
 blast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the count 
 let the wolf go what sportsmen and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punished schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win sympathy for his plight but simon was no longer there he was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to head the wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so

 the absolute goodness of prayer 
 with regard to the modes of prayer all are good provided that they are sincere 
 turn your book upside down and be in the infinite 
 there is as we know a philosophy which denies the infinite there is also a philosophy pathologically classified which denies the sun this philosophy is called blindness 
 to erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth is a fine blind 
 the curious thing is the haughty superior and compassionate airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds god 
 one fancies he hears a mole crying i pity them with their sun 
 there are as we know powerful and illustrious atheists 
 at bottom led back to the truth by their very force they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists it is with them only a question of definition and in any case if they do not believe in god being great minds they prove god 
 we salute them as philosophers while inexorably denouncing their philosophy 
 let us go on 
 the remarkable thing about it is also their facility in paying themselves off with words 
 a metaphysical school of the north impregnated to some extent with fog has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word force with the word will 
 to say 
 the plant wills instead of 
 the plant grows this would be fecund in results indeed if we were to add the universe wills 
 why 
 because it would come to this the plant wills therefore it has an i the universe wills therefore it has a god 
 as for us who however in contradistinction to this school reject nothing a priori a will in the plant accepted by this school appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it 
 to deny the will of the infinite that is to say god is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite 
 we have demonstrated this 
 the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism everything becomes a mental conception 
 with nihilism no discussion is possible for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor and is not quite sure that it exists itself 
 from its point of view it is possible that it may be for itself only a mental conception 
 only it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump simply by the utterance of the word mind 
 in short no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all end in the monosyllable no 
 to no there is only one reply yes 
 nihilism has no point 
 there is no such thing as nothingness 
 zero does not exist everything is something 
 nothing is nothing 
 man lives by affirmation even more than by bread 
 even to see and to show does not suffice 
 philosophy should be an energy it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man 
 socrates should enter into adam and produce marcus aurelius in other words the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man of felicity 
 eden should be changed into a lyceum science should be a cordial

 nicholas rostov meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf by the way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmen approached receded and rose he realized what was happening at the copse he knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds had separated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and that something had gone wrong he expected the wolf to come his way any moment he made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it hope alternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to god that the wolf should come his way he prayed with that passionate and feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial causes what would it be to thee to do this for me he said to god i know thou art great and that it is a sin to ask this of thee but for sake do let the old wolf come my way and let karay spring at it in sight of uncle who is watching from over there and seize it by the throat in a death grip a thousand times during that rostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge of the wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its side and cap just visible above the bush on his right 
 no i have such luck thought rostov yet what it be worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am always unlucky memories of austerlitz and of dolokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind only once in my life to get an old wolf i want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs 
 again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across the deserted field no it be thought rostov taking a deep breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for the height of happiness was reached and so simply without warning or noise or display that rostov could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path she was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that no one saw her rostov holding his breath looked round at the borzois they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation old karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs 
 ulyulyulyu whispered rostov pouting his lips the borzois jumped up jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears karay finished scratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down 
 shall i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse suddenly the whole physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never seen before human eyes fixed upon her and turning her head a little toward rostov she paused 
 back or forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet long easy yet resolute lope 
 ulyulyu cried nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to head off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see the borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf who increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollow the first to come into view was milka with her black markings and powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer now she was ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and instead of putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs 
 ulyulyulyulyu shouted nicholas 
 the reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka sprang impetuously at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumped aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again rose and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois who did not get any closer to her 
 get away no impossible thought nicholas still shouting with a hoarse voice 
 karay ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope karay with all the strength age had left him stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily aside to intercept it but the quickness of the lope and the slower pace made it plain that karay had miscalculated nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward him he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf there was still hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas did not know from another leash rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over but the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at the yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on the ground bleeding from a gash in its side 
 karay old fellow wailed nicholas 
 thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the path the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it as if aware of her danger the wolf turned her eyes on karay tucked her tail yet further between her legs and increased her speed but here nicholas only saw that something happened to karay the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them 
 that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head with her ears laid back karay was pinning her by the throat was the happiest moment of his life with his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully she clicked her teeth karay no longer had her by the throat leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully and having disengaged herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went forward karay his hair bristling and probably bruised or wounded climbed with difficulty out of the gully 
 oh my god why nicholas cried in despair 
 huntsman was galloping from the other side across the path and his borzois once more stopped the advance she was again hemmed in 
 nicholas and his attendant with uncle and his huntsman were all riding round the wolf crying ulyulyu shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe 
 already at the beginning of this chase daniel hearing the ulyulyuing had rushed out from the wood he saw karay seize the wolf and checked his horse supposing the affair to be over but when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for safety daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straight toward the wood just as karay had run to cut the animal off as a result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by borzois 
 daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail 
 nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut breathing heavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and saw daniel lying on the back among the dogs trying to seize her by the ears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself that all was now over the terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise but the borzois stuck to her daniel rose a little took a step and with his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on the wolf seizing her by the ears nicholas was about to stab her but daniel whispered gag her and changing his position set his foot on the neck a stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were bound together and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side 
 with happy exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shying and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took her to the place where they were all to meet the hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three the huntsmen assembled with their booty and their stories and all came to look at the wolf which with her head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding her when she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody old count rostov also rode up and touched the wolf 
 oh what a formidable one said he a formidable one eh he asked daniel who was standing near 
 yes your excellency answered daniel quickly doffing his cap 
 the count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with daniel 
 ah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count 
 for sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable smile

 the old count went home and natasha and petya promised to return very soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips 
 facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been loosed before nicholas heard one he knew voltorn giving tongue at intervals other hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue a moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from nicholas 
 he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite 
 the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and nicholas saw a queer red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois formed a figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat 
 this thought nicholas that huntsman from he is not man 
 the huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strapping it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stood near them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound of a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight 
 huntsman having a row with our ivan said nicholas groom 
 nicholas sent the man to call natasha and petya to him and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on 
 nicholas dismounted and with natasha and petya who had ridden up stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his young master with the fox tied to his crupper while still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry one of his eyes was black but he probably was not even aware of it 
 what has happened asked nicholas 
 a likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my gray bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fox i gave him one with the fox here it is on my saddle do you want a taste of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe 
 nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the hunting party was 
 the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and there surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploits 
 the facts were that ilagin with whom the rostovs had a quarrel and were at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rostovs and had now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the rostovs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased 
 nicholas though he had never seen ilagin with his usual absence of moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe he rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy 
 hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome horse accompanied by two hunt servants 
 instead of an enemy nicholas found in ilagin a stately and courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young acquaintance having ridden up to nicholas ilagin raised his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited him to draw his covert 
 natasha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful had followed him in some excitement seeing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings she rode up to them ilagin lifted his beaver cap still higher to natasha and said with a pleasant smile that the young countess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her beauty of which he had heard much 
 to expiate his offense ilagin pressed the rostovs to come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and the hunt now doubled moved on 
 the way to upland was across the fields the hunt servants fell into line the masters rode together uncle rostov and ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one dogs trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois 
 rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small bitch on leash slender but with muscles like steel a delicate muzzle and prominent black eyes he had heard of the swiftness of borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own milka 
 in the middle of a sober conversation begun by ilagin about the harvest nicholas pointed to the bitch 
 a fine little bitch that said he in a careless tone is she swift 
 that one yes a good dog gets what after answered ilagin indifferently of the bitch erza for which a year before he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs so in your parts too the harvest is nothing to boast of count he went on continuing the conversation they had begun and considering it polite to return the young compliment ilagin looked at his borzois and picked out milka who attracted his attention by her breadth that one of yours is fine well shaped said he 
 yes fast enough replied nicholas and thought if only a hare would cross the field now show you what sort of borzoi she is and turning to his groom he said he would give a ruble to anyone who found a hare 
 i understand continued ilagin how some sportsmen can be so jealous about game and dogs for myself i can tell you count i enjoy riding in company such as this what could be better he again raised his cap to natasha but as for counting skins and what one takes i care about that 
 of course not 
 or being upset because someone borzoi and not mine catches something all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not so count for i consider that 
 came the cry of one of the borzoi who had halted he stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip aloft and again repeated his cry this call and the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare 
 ah he has found one i think said ilagin carelessly yes we must ride up shall we both course it answered nicholas seeing in erza and red rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting against his own borzois and suppose they outdo my milka at once he thought as he rode with uncle and ilagin toward the hare 
 a one asked ilagin as he approached the whip who had sighted the hare and not without agitation he looked round and whistled to erza 
 and you michael nikanorovich he said addressing uncle 
 the latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face 
 how can i join in why given a village for each of your borzois it come on yours are worth thousands try yours against one another you two and look on 
 rugay hey hey he shouted rugayushka he added involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by it 
 the huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hounds that were far off on the horizon turned away from the hare and the whips but not the gentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedately 
 how is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare 
 but before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost coming next morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare all the hunt who had been moving slowly shouted stop calling in the hounds while the borzoi whips with a cry of across the field setting the borzois on the hare the tranquil ilagin nicholas natasha and uncle flew reckless of where and how they went seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase the hare they had started was a strong and swift one when he jumped up he did not run at once but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once he took a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the borzois gain on him and finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger laid back his ears and rushed off headlong he had been lying in the stubble but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft the two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been the nearest were the first to see and pursue him but they had not gone far before erza passed them got within a length flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut and thinking she had seized him rolled over like a ball the hare arched his back and bounded off yet more swiftly from behind erza rushed the milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare 
 milashka dear rose nicholas triumphant cry it looked as if milka would immediately pounce on the hare but she overtook him and flew past the hare had squatted again the beautiful erza reached him but when close to the scut paused as if measuring the distance so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg 
 erza darling ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own erza did not hearken to his appeal at the very moment when she would have seized her prey the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble again erza and milka were abreast running like a pair of carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly 
 rugay rugayushka it come on came a third voice just then and red borzoi straining and curving its back caught up with the two foremost borzois pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously sinking to his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was how muddying his back he rolled over with the hare a ring of borzois surrounded him a moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs only the delighted uncle dismounted and cut off a pad shaking the hare for the blood to drip off and anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about it come on a dog there it has beaten them all the as well as the borzois it come on said he panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself there are your ones it come on 
 rugay a pad for you he said throwing down the muddy pad deserved it it come on 
 tired herself out run it down three times by herself said nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were heard or not 
 but what is there in running across it like that said groom 
 once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it ilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his excitement at the same moment natasha without drawing breath screamed joyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set ear tingling by that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once and it was so strange that she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at any other time uncle himself twisted up the hare threw it neatly and smartly across his back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone mounted his bay and rode off the others all followed dispirited and shamefaced and only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference for a long time they continued to look at red rugay who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash walked along just behind horse with the serene air of a conqueror 
 well i am like any other dog as long as not a question of coursing but when it is then look out his appearance seem to nicholas to be saying 
 when much later uncle rode up to nicholas and began talking to him he felt flattered that after what had happened uncle deigned to speak to him

 the old count went home and natasha and petya promised to return very soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips

 chapter vii 
 
 toward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas who found that they were so far from home that he accepted offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovna 
 and if you put up at my house that will be better still it come on said uncle you see damp weather and you could rest and the little countess could be driven home in a trap 
 offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for a trap while nicholas rode with natasha and petya to house 
 some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving the presence of natasha a woman a lady and on horseback raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her 
 arinka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt dangles see got a little hunting horn 
 goodness gracious see her knife 
 she a tartar 
 how is it you go head over heels asked the boldest of all addressing natasha directly 
 uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors 
 the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natasha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the house with its bare unplastered log walls was not overclean it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but neither was it noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples and wolf and fox skins hung about 
 uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvorov of the father and mother and of himself in military uniform the study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs uncle asked his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room rugay his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the sofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen from behind this came laughter and whispers natasha nicholas and petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa petya leaning on his elbow fell asleep at once natasha and nicholas were silent their faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful they looked at one another now that the hunt was over and they were in the house nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister natasha gave him a wink and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it 
 after a while uncle came in in a cossack coat blue trousers and small top boots and natasha felt that this costume the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the right thing and not at all worse than a or frock coat uncle too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the and laughter it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the merriment 
 right young countess it come on i never saw anyone like her said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and with a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that had been cut short ridden all day like a man and is as fresh as ever 
 soon after reappearance the door was opened evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy woman of about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying a large loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasant smile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional stoutness which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head this woman who was housekeeper trod very lightly she went to the table set down the tray and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors and dishes and arranged them on the table when she had finished she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her face here i am i am she now do you understand uncle her expression said to rostov how could one help understanding not only nicholas but even natasha understood the meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when anisya fedorovna entered on the tray was a bottle of herb wine different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms rye cakes made with buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and sparkling mead apples nuts raw and roasted and sweets afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves made with honey and preserves made with sugar 
 all this was the fruit of anisya housekeeping gathered and prepared by her the smell and taste of it all had a smack of anisya fedorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness whiteness and pleasant smiles 
 take this little she kept saying as she offered natasha first one thing and then another 
 natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such sweets or such a chicken anywhere anisya fedorovna left the room 
 after supper over their cherry brandy rostov and uncle talked of past and future hunts of rugay and dogs while natasha sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried several times to wake petya that he might eat something but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up natasha felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon after a casual pause such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in own house uncle answering a thought that was in his visitors mind said 
 this you see is how i am finishing my days death will come it come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone 
 face was very significant and even handsome as he said this involuntarily rostov recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors throughout the whole province uncle had the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks they called him in to decide family disputes chose him as executor confided secrets to him elected him to be a justice and to other posts but he always persistently refused public appointments passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding sitting at home in winter and lying in his overgrown garden in summer 
 why you enter the service uncle 
 i did once but gave it up i am not fit for it it come on i make head or tail of it for you i brains enough now hunting is another matter it come on open the door there he shouted why have you shut it 
 the door at the end of the passage led to the room as they called the room for the hunt servants 
 there was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the door into the room from which came the clear sounds of a balalayka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art was playing natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out into the passage to hear better 
 mitka my coachman i have got him a good balalayka fond of it said uncle 
 it was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the room when uncle returned from the chase uncle was fond of such music 
 how good really very good said nicholas with some unintentional superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very much 
 very good said natasha reproachfully noticing her tone not very good simply delicious 
 just as pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world so also that song at that moment seemed to her the acme of musical delight 
 more please more cried natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka ceased mitka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the balalayka to the air of my lady with trills and variations uncle sat listening slightly smiling with his head on one side the air was repeated a hundred times the balalayka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again anisya fedorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost 
 you like listening she said to natasha with a smile extremely like a good player of ours she added 
 he play that part right said uncle suddenly with an energetic gesture here he ought to burst out it come on ought to burst out 
 do you play then asked natasha 
 uncle did not answer but smiled 
 anisya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right i touched it for a long time it come on given it up 
 anisya fedorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar 
 without looking at anyone uncle blew the dust off it and tapping the case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in his armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at anisya fedorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and then quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time not my lady but the song came a maiden down the street the tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in the hearts of nicholas and natasha arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from anisya whole being anisya fedorovna flushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room uncle continued to play correctly carefully with energetic firmness looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where anisya fedorovna had just stood something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here and there as he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snap 
 lovely lovely go on uncle go on shouted natasha as soon as he had finished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas nicholas she said turning to her brother as if asking him what is it moves me so 
 nicholas too was greatly pleased by playing and uncle played the piece over again anisya smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces 
 fetching water clear and sweet 
 stop dear maiden i entreat played uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over the strings and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders 
 go on uncle dear natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life depended on it 
 uncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck a naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance 
 now then niece he exclaimed waving to natasha the hand that had just struck a chord 
 natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to face uncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude 
 where how and when had this young countess educated by an emigree french governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de chale would one would have supposed long ago have effaced but the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that uncle had expected of her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled triumphantly proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seized nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end and they were already admiring her 
 the french shawl dance 
 she did the right thing with such precision such complete precision that anisya fedorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as she watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself who yet was able to understand all that was in anisya and in father and mother and aunt and in every russian man and woman 
 well little countess it come on cried uncle with a joyous laugh having finished the dance well done niece now a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you it come on 
 chosen already said nicholas smiling 
 oh said uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at natasha who nodded her head with a happy smile 
 and such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas smile mean when he said chosen already is he glad of it or not it is as if he thought my bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety but he would understand it all where is he now she thought and her face suddenly became serious but this lasted only a second dare to think about it she said to herself and sat down again smilingly beside uncle begging him to play something more 
 uncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song 
 as twas growing dark last night 
 fell the snow so soft and light 
 uncle sang as peasants sing with full and naive conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which exists only to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsidered tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good natasha was in ecstasies over singing she resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar she asked uncle for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song 
 after nine two traps and three mounted men who had been sent to look for them arrived to fetch natasha and petya the count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one of the men 
 petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps natasha and nicholas got into the other uncle wrapped natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness he accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns 
 dear niece his voice called out of the darkness not the voice natasha had known previously but the one that had sung as twas growing dark last night 
 in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke 
 what a darling uncle is said natasha when they had come out onto the highroad 
 yes returned nicholas not cold 
 no quite quite all right i feel so comfortable answered natasha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a long while the night was dark and damp they could not see the horses but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud 
 what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they all find place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark last night the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught 
 got it said nicholas 
 what were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natasha 
 they were fond of asking one another that question 
 i said nicholas trying to remember well you see first i thought that rugay the red hound was like uncle and that if he were a man he would always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then for his manner what a good fellow uncle is you think so well and you 
 i wait a bit wait yes first i thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in otradnoe but in fairyland and then i thought no nothing else 
 i know i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as natasha knew by the sound of his voice 
 no said natasha though she had in reality been thinking about prince andrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would have liked uncle and then i was saying to myself all the way how well anisya carried herself how well and nicholas heard her spontaneous happy ringing laughter and do you know she suddenly said i know that i shall never again be as happy and tranquil as i am now 
 rubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought how charming this natasha of mine is i have no other friend like her and never shall have why should she marry we might always drive about together 
 what a darling this nicholas of mine is thought natasha 
 ah there are still lights in the drawingroom she said pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety darkness of the night

 toward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas who found that they were so far from home that he accepted offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovna 
 and if you put up at my house that will be better still it come on said uncle you see damp weather and you could rest and the little countess could be driven home in a trap 
 offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for a trap while nicholas rode with natasha and petya to house 
 some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving the presence of natasha a woman a lady and on horseback raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her 
 arinka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt dangles see got a little hunting horn 
 goodness gracious see her knife

 how is it you go head over heels asked the boldest of all addressing natasha directly

 of goodness goodness of nature 
 i take goodness in this sense the affecting of the weal of men which is that the 
 grecians call philanthropia and the word humanity as it is used is a little too 
 light to express it goodness i call the habit and goodness of nature the inclination 
 this of all virtues and dignities of the mind is the greatest being the character 
 of the deity and without it man is a busy mischievous wretched thing no better than a kind of vermin goodness answers to the theological virtue charity and admits no excess but error the desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall but in charity there is no excess neither can angel or man come in danger by it the inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man in so much that if it issue not towards men it will take unto other living creatures as it is seen in the turks a cruel people who nevertheless are kind to beasts and give alms to dogs and birds in so much as busbechius reporteth a christian boy in constantinople had like to have been stoned for gagging in a waggishness a long billed fowl errors indeed in this virtue of goodness or charity may be committed the italians have an ungracious proverb tanto buon che val niente so good that he is good for nothing and one of the doctors of italy nicholas machiavelli had the confidence to put in writing almost in plain terms that the christian faith had given up good men in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust which he spoke because indeed there was never law or sect or opinion did so much magnify goodness as the christian religion doth 
 therefore to avoid the scandal and the danger both it is good to take knowledge of the errors of an habit so excellent seek the good of other men but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies for that is but facility or softness which taketh an honest mind prisoner neither give thou cock a gem who would be better pleased and happier if he had had a barley corn 
 the example of god teacheth the lesson truly he sendeth his rain and maketh his sun to shine upon the just and unjust but he doth not rain wealth nor shine honour and virtues upon men equally common benefits are to be communicate with all but peculiar benefits with choice and beware how in making the portraiture thou breakest the pattern for divinity maketh the love of ourselves the pattern the love of our neighbours but the portraiture sell all thou hast and give it to me poor and follow me but sell not all thou hast except thou come and follow me that is except thou have a vocation wherein thou may do as much good with little means as with great for otherwise in 
 feeding the streams thou driest the fountain neither is there only a habit of 
 goodness directed by right reason but mere is in some men even in nature a 
 disposition towards it as on the other side there is a natural malignity 
 for there be that in their nature do not affect the good of others the lighter sort of malignity turneth but to a crossness or forwardness or aptness to oppose or difficultness or the like but the deeper sort to envy and mere mischief such men in other calamities are as it were in season and are ever on the loading part not so good as the dogs that licked sores but like flies that are still buzzing upon anything that is raw misanthropi that make it their practice to bring men to the bough and yet have never a tree for the purpose in their gardens as timon had 
 such dispositions are the very errors of human nature and yet they are the fittest 
 timber to make great politics of like to knee timber that is good for ships that 
 are ordained to be tossed but not for building houses that shall stand firm the 
 parts and signs of goodness are many if a man be gracious and courteous to strangers it shows he is a citizen of the world and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands but a continent that joins to them if he be compassionate towards the afflictions of others it shows mat his heart is like the noble tree that is wounded itself when it gives the balm if he easily pardons and remits offences it shows that his mind is planted above injuries so that he cannot be shot if he be thankful for small benefits it shows that he weighs minds and not their trash but above all if he have st perfection that he would wish to be an anathema from christ for the salvation of his brethren it shows much of a divine nature and a kind of conformity with christ himself

 of the deity and without it man is a busy mischievous wretched thing no better than a kind of vermin goodness answers to the theological virtue charity and admits no excess but error the desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall but in charity there is no excess neither can angel or man come in danger by it the inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man in so much that if it issue not towards men it will take unto other living creatures as it is seen in the turks a cruel people who nevertheless are kind to beasts and give alms to dogs and birds in so much as busbechius reporteth a christian boy in constantinople had like to have been stoned for gagging in a waggishness a long billed fowl errors indeed in this virtue of goodness or charity may be committed the italians have an ungracious proverb tanto buon che val niente so good that he is good for nothing and one of the doctors of italy nicholas machiavelli had the confidence to put in writing almost in plain terms that the christian faith had given up good men in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust which he spoke because indeed there was never law or sect or opinion did so much magnify goodness as the christian religion doth 
 therefore to avoid the scandal and the danger both it is good to take knowledge of the errors of an habit so excellent seek the good of other men but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies for that is but facility or softness which taketh an honest mind prisoner neither give thou cock a gem who would be better pleased and happier if he had had a barley corn 
 the example of god teacheth the lesson truly he sendeth his rain and maketh his sun to shine upon the just and unjust but he doth not rain wealth nor shine honour and virtues upon men equally common benefits are to be communicate with all but peculiar benefits with choice and beware how in making the portraiture thou breakest the pattern for divinity maketh the love of ourselves the pattern the love of our neighbours but the portraiture sell all thou hast and give it to me poor and follow me but sell not all thou hast except thou come and follow me that is except thou have a vocation wherein thou may do as much good with little means as with great for otherwise in 
 feeding the streams thou driest the fountain neither is there only a habit of 
 goodness directed by right reason but mere is in some men even in nature a 
 disposition towards it as on the other side there is a natural malignity 
 for there be that in their nature do not affect the good of others the lighter sort of malignity turneth but to a crossness or forwardness or aptness to oppose or difficultness or the like but the deeper sort to envy and mere mischief such men in other calamities are as it were in season and are ever on the loading part not so good as the dogs that licked sores but like flies that are still buzzing upon anything that is raw misanthropi that make it their practice to bring men to the bough and yet have never a tree for the purpose in their gardens as timon had 
 such dispositions are the very errors of human nature and yet they are the fittest 
 timber to make great politics of like to knee timber that is good for ships that 
 are ordained to be tossed but not for building houses that shall stand firm the 
 parts and signs of goodness are many if a man be gracious and courteous to strangers it shows he is a citizen of the world and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands but a continent that joins to them if he be compassionate towards the afflictions of others it shows mat his heart is like the noble tree that is wounded itself when it gives the balm if he easily pardons and remits offences it shows that his mind is planted above injuries so that he cannot be shot if he be thankful for small benefits it shows that he weighs minds and not their trash but above all if he have st perfection that he would wish to be an anathema from christ for the salvation of his brethren it shows much of a divine nature and a kind of conformity with christ himself

 ann looks out across the floor and then seeing joe and irving waves irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement 
 on the bridge up above the dancing several cars pull up several men climb out rushing over to the steps the first secret service man smoking a cigarette watches the men approach the men walk over to the tables 
 ann continues dancing with mario who suddenly stops looking at her hair

 moment 
 
 he stops thinking and then taking out a comb brushes her fringe apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat tufts he puts his comb away satisfied ann moves to touch her hair but mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue dancing 
 one of the secret service men stands leaning against a structure swinging his hand to the beat smiling the man watching behind rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls his hat down putting his hands in his pockets looking out again over the dancing 
 the music stops and everyone applauds the musicians 
 
 mario delani 
 thank you 
 
 the first secret service man comes over to ann then mario seeing him says something to ann in italian then bye and leaves her to him

 joe sees more secret service coming from the other side so he runs back the other way cornered he confronts them as they close ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and the crowd cheers irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men having his beard pulled but responds to this with an angry punch to the face mario runs over his hair with his comb muttering some italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to help joe the conductor of the band motions to the musicians to start playing and they respond with an energetic tune the scene of chaos continues joe and irving and mario laying into the secret service men distracted two of the men manage to grab ann and drag her away joe runs after irving following with his camera 
 joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds with a punch freeing ann ann looks around her for a way to help picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at man joe keeps fighting with the man as ann picks up a guitar lying near the band and stands behind him on a chair one of the men starts towards her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head then swings it down hitting him full on the head stunning him for a moment 
 
 irving 
 excitedly trying to get his camera ready having missed the shot the first time 
 hit him again smithy 
 the drummer rolls again as ann swings the guitar back then releasing it and smashing it over the camera flashing as she does so 
 police sirens sound and the polizia arrive packed into their cars as they spill out joe ann and irving start to leave the scene leaving the secret service men staggering or lying about the dance floor dazed 
 
 irving

 joe 
 to irving he stops pointing at the police 
 police police 
 
 irving 
 seeing them arrive in numbers they change their direction 
 the other side of the bridge 
 as joe and ann run across the barges irving tries stalling the men who try to follow with a life belt but they make it past him running to follow ann joe and ann run through a boathouse and on reaching the other end walk along the outside edge just above the water 
 unseen a secret service man covers the outside of the boathouse as they double back joe peers round the corner and the man surprises him with a punch to the face knocking him into the water ann knees him in the groin and pushes him away she holds her nose and dives in after joe just escaping the reach of the man as he tries to stop her the polizia arrest the remaining secret service men and take them away one of them being dragged by a guitar around his neck his head clean through the guitar the band starts up again and people replace the fallen furniture as the crowd waves across the water apparently after joe and ann as they swim away 
 joe and ann stagger out of the water completely wet through joe leads her to a rock where they sit down joe rubbing her around the shoulders as she shivers 
 
 joe

 leia organa sat silently before the huge display screen on which yavin and its moonswere displayed a large red dot moved steadily toward the fourth of those and several other field commanders of the alliance stood behind her theireyes also intent on the screen tiny green flecks began to appear around the fourthmoon to coalesce into the small clouds like hovering emerald put a hand on her shoulder it was comforting the red represents theprogress of the imperial battle station as it moves deeper into system 
 our ships are all away a commander behind him declared 
 a single man stood alone in the cylindrical hold secured to the top of a tower staring through electrobinoculars he was the sole visiblerepresentative of the vast technology buried in the green purgatory below 
 muted cries moans and primeval gurglings drifted up to him from the highesttreetops some were frightening some less so but none were as indicative of powerheld in check as the four silvery starships which burst into view above the a tight formation they exploded through humid air to vanish in seconds intothe morning cloud cover far above rattled the trees moments a forlorn attempt to catch up to the engines which had produced them 
 slowly assuming attack formations combining x and ships the variousfighters began to move outward from the moon out past the oceanic atmosphere ofgiant yavin out to meet the technologic executioner 
 the man who had observed the between biggs and luke now loweredhis glare visor and adjusted his gunsights as he checkedthe ships to either side of him 
 blue boys he addressed his intership pickup this is blue leader adjustyour selectors and check in approaching target at one point three 
 ahead the bright sphere of what looked like on of moons but to glow with increasing brightness it shone with an eerie metallic glowutterly unlike that of any natural satellite as he watched the giant battle stationmake its way around the rim of yavin blue thoughts traveled back over theyears over the uncountable injustices the innocents taken away for interrogationand never heard from whole multitude of evils incurred by an increasinglycorrupt and indifferent imperial government all those terrors and agonies wereconcentrated magnified represented by the single bloated feat of engineering theywere approaching now 
 this is it boys he said to the mike blue two too far out close itup wedge 
 the young pilot luke had encountered in the temple briefing room glanced tostarboard then back to his instruments he executed a slight adjustment boss my ranger seems to be a few points off have to go on manual 
 check blue two watch yourself all ships stand by to lock inattack mode 
 one after another from luke and biggs wedge and the other members of blueassault squadron the replies came back standing by 
 execute blue leader commanded when john d and piggy had indicated theywere in readiness 
 the double wings on the fighters split apart like narrow seeds eachfighter now displayed four wings its armament and quadruple enginesnow deployed for maximum firepower and maneuverability 
 ahead they imperial station continued to grow surface features becamevisible as each pilot recognized docking bays broadcast antennae and other mountains and canyons 
 as he neared that threatening black sphere for the second time breathinggrew faster automatic machinery detected the respiratory shift andcompensated properly 
 something began to buffet his ship almost as if he were back in his skyhopperagain wrestling with the unpredictable winds of tatooine he experienced a badmoment of uncertainty until the calming voice of blue leader sounded in his ears 
 passing through their outer shields hold tight lock down controls and switch your own deflectors on double front 
 the shaking and buffeting continued worsened not knowing how tocompensate luke did exactly what he should have remained in control and followedorders then the turbulence was gone and the deathly cold peacefulness of spacehad returned 
 it through blue leader told them quietly keep all channelssilent until on top of them it look like expecting muchresistance 
 though half the great station remained in shadow they were now near enoughfor luke to be able to discern individual lights on its surface a ship that could showphases matching a moononce again he marveled at the misplaced ingenuity andeffort which had gone into its construction thousands of lights scattered across itscurving expanse gave it the appearance of a floating city 
 some of comrades since this was their first sight of the station wereeven more impressed look at the size of that thing wedge antilles gasped overhis open pickup 
 cut the chatter blue two blue leader ordered accelerate to attackvelocity 
 grim determination showed in expression as he flipped several switchesabove his head and began adjusting his computer target readout artoo detooreexamined the nearing station and thought untranslatable electronic thoughts 
 blue leader compared the station with the location of their proposed target leader he called toward the pickup this is blue leader in can go right in the exhaust shaft is farther to the north keep em busydown here 
 red leader was the physical opposite of squadron commander heresembled the popular notion of a credit slim shy of face hisskills and dedication however easily matched those of his counterpart and old friend 
 starting for the target shaft now dutch stand by to take over ifanything happens 
 check red leader came the reply going to cross theirequatorial axis and try to draw their main fire may the force be with you 
 from the approaching swarm two squads of fighters broke clear the dove directly for the bulge of the station far below while the curveddown and northward over its surface 
 within the station alarm sirens began a mournful clangorous wail as personnel realized that the impregnable fortress was actually under organizedattack admiral motti and his tacticians had expected the resistance to becentered around a massive defense of the moon itself they were completelyunprepared for an offensive response consisting of dozens of tiny snub ships 
 imperial efficiency was in the process of compensating for this strategicoversight soldiers scrambled to man enormous thrummed as powerful motors aligned the huge devices for a web of annihilation began to develop the station as energy weapons electricalbolts and explosive solids ripped out at the oncoming rebel craft 
 this is blue five luke announced to his mike as he nose dived his ship in theradical attempt to confuse any electronic predictors below the gray surface of thebattle station streaked past his ports going in 
 right behind you blue five a voice recognizable as sounded inhis ears 
 the target in sights was as stable as that of the imperial defenders wasevasive bolts flew from the tiny weapons one started a huge fire on thedim surface below which would burn until the crew of the station could shut off theflow of air to the damaged section 
 glee turned to terror as he realized he swerve his craft in time toavoid passing through the fireball of unknown composition pull out luke pullout biggs was screaming at him 
 but despite commands to shift course the automatic pressors allow thenecessary centrifugal force his father plunged into the expanding balls ofsuperheated gases 
 then he was through and clear on the other side a rapid check of his controlsenabled him to relax passage through the intense heat had been insufficient todamage anything all four wings bore streaks of black carbonizedtestimony to the nearness of his escape 
 bloomed outside his ship as he swung it up and around in a sharpcurve you all right luke came concerned query 
 i got a little toasted but okay 
 a different stern voice sounded blue five warned the squadron better give yourself more lead time or going to destroy yourself as wellas the imperial construction 
 yes sir got the hang of it now like you said not exactly likeflying a skyhopper 
 energy bolts and beams continued to create a chromatic maze in thespace above the station as the rebel fighters crisscrossed back and forth over itssurface firing at whatever looked like a decent target two of the tiny craftconcentrated on a power terminal it blew up throwing electric arcsfrom the innards 
 inside troopers mechanicals and equipment were blown in all directions bysubsidiary explosions as the effects of the blast traveled back down various conduitsand cables where the explosion had hulled the station escaping atmosphere suckedhelpless soldiers and droids out into a bottomless black tomb 
 moving from position to position a figure of dark calm amid the chaos wasdarth vader a harried commander rushed up to him and reported breathlessly 
 lord vader we count at least thirty of them of two types they are so smalland quick the fixed guns cannot follow them accurately they continuously evadethe predictors 
 get all tie crews to their fighters have to go out after them and destroythem ship by ship 
 within numerous hangars red lights began flashing and an insistent alarm startedto ring ground crews worked frantically to ready ships as imperialpilots grabbed for helmets and packs 
 luke requested blue leader as he skimmed smoothly through a rain of me know when off the block 
 on my way now 
 watch yourself the voice urged over the cockpit speaker a lot offire coming from the starboard side of that deflection tower 
 on it worry luke responded confidently putting his fighter into atwisting dive he sliced once more across metal horizons antennae and smallprotruding emplacements burst into transitory flame as bolts from his wing tips struckwith deadly accuracy 
 he grinned as he pulled up and away from the surface as intense lines of energypassed through space recently vacated darned if it like hunting home in the crumbling canyons of wastes 
 biggs followed luke on a similar run even as imperial pilots prepared to liftclear of the station within the many docking bays technical crews rushed hurriedlyto unlock power cables and conclude desperate final checks 
 more care was taken in preparing a particular craft nearest one of the bay one into which darth vader barely succeeded in squeezing his huge frame onceset in the seat he slid a second set of eye shields across his face 
 the atmosphere of the war room back in the temple was one of nervousexpectancy occasional blinks and buzzes from the main battle screen soundedlouder than the soft sussuration of hopeful people trying to reassure one a far corner of the mass of flickering lights a technician leaned a little closer tohis own readouts before speaking into the pickup suspended near his mouth 
 squad squad picked up a newset of signals from the other side of the station enemy fighters coming your way 
 luke received the report at the same time as everyone else he began huntingthe sky for the predicted imperial craft his gaze dropping to his negative i see anything 
 maintain visual scanning blue leader directed with all this energy be on top of you before your scope can pick them up remember they canjam every instrument on your ship except your eyes 
 luke turned again and this time saw an imperial already pursuing an with a number luke quickly recognized 
 biggs he shouted picked one up on your tailwatch it 
 i see it came his panicked response where is he i it 
 luke watched helplessly as ship shot away from the station surface andout into clear space closely followed by the imperial the enemy vessel firedsteadily at him each successive bolt seeming to pass a little closer to hull 
 on my tight the voice sounded in cockpit i shake him 
 twisting spinning biggs looped back toward the battle station but the pilottrailing him was persistent and showed no sign of relinquishing pursuit 
 hang on biggs luke called wrenching his ship around so steeply that thestraining gyros whined coming in 
 so absorbed in his pursuit of biggs was the imperial pilot that he see rotated his own ship flipped out of the concealing gray below and dropped inbehind him 
 electronic crosshairs lined up according to the luke fired repeatedly there was a small explosion in comparedwith the enormous energies being put out by the emplacements on the surface of thebattle station but the explosion was of particular significance to three people and most particularly to the pilot of the tie fighter who was vaporized withhis ship 
 got him luke murmured 
 got one got one came a less restrained cry of triumph over theopen intercom luke identified the voice as belonging to a young pilot known asjohn d yes that was blue six chasing another imperial fighter across the metallandscape bolts jumped from the in steady succession until the tie fighterblew in half sending glittering metal fragments flying in all directions 
 good shooting blue six the squadron leader commented then he addedquickly watch out got one on your tail 
 within the cockpit the gleeful smile on the young face vanishedinstantly as he looked around unable to spot his pursuer something flared brightlynearby so close that his starboard port burst then something hit even closer and theinterior of the now open cockpit became a mass of flames 
 hit hit 
 that was all he had time to scream before oblivion took him from behind farabove and to one side blue leader saw john ship expand in fiery ball his lipsmay have whitened slightly otherwise he might as well never have seen the for all the reaction he displayed he had more important things to do 
 on the fourth moon of yavin a spacious screen chose that moment to flicker anddie much as john d had worried technicians began rushing in all turned a drawn face to leia the expectant commanders and one tall bronzedrobot 
 the receiver has failed it will take some time to fix 
 do the best you can leia snapped switch to audio only 
 someone overheard and in seconds the room was filled with the sounds ofdistant battle interspersed with the voices of those involved 
 tighten it up blue two tighten it up blue leader was saying watch thosetowers 
 heavy fire boss came to the voice of wedge antilles degrees 
 i see it pull in pull in picking up some interference 
 i believe it biggs was stammering never seen such firepower 
 pull in blue five pull in a pause then luke do you read 
 all right chief came reply got a target going tocheck it out 
 too much action down there luke biggs told him get out doyou read me luke pull out 
 break off luke ordered the deeper tones of blue leader hit toomuch interference here luke i repeat break off i see him blue two doyou see blue five 
 negative wedge replied quickly a fire zone here you my jammed blue five where are you luke are you allright 
 gone biggs started to report solemnly then his voice rose he is looks like a little fin damage but the fine 
 relief swept the war room and it was most noticeable in the face of the beautiful senator present 
 on the battle station troopers worn half to death or deafened by the concussionof the big guns were replaced by fresh crews none of them had time to wonder howthe battle was going and at the moment none of them much cared a malady shared bycommon soldiers since the dawn of history 
 luke skimmed daringly low over the surface his attention riveted on adistant metal projection 
 stick close blue five the squadron commander directed him where areyou going 
 picked up what looks like a lateral stabilizer luke replied goingto try for it 
 watch yourself blue five heavy fire in your area 
 luke ignored the warning as he headed the fighter straight toward the oddlyshaped protuberance his determination was rewarded when after saturating it withfire he saw it erupt in a spectacular ball of superhot gas 
 got it he exclaimed continuing south for another one 
 within the rebel leia listened intently she seemedsimultaneously angry and frightened finally she turned to threepio and is luke taking so many chances the tall droid reply 
 watch your back luke voice sounded over the speakers watch yourback fighters above you coming in 
 leia strained to see what she could only hear she alone help threepio was whispering to himself and keep holding on 
 luke continued his dive even as he looked back and spotted the object of close on his tail reluctantly he pulled up and away from the station his target his tormentor was good however and continued closing onhim 
 i shake him he reported 
 something cut across the sky toward both ships on him luke shoutedwedge antilles hold on 
 luke have to for very long gunnery was precise and the tiefighter vanished brightly shortly thereafter 
 good shooting wedge that was biggs again blue four going me porkins 
 right with you blue three came the other assurance 
 biggs leveled them off let go with full weaponry no one ever decided exactlywhat it was he hit but the small tower that blew up under his energy bolts wasobviously more important than it looked 
 a series of sequential explosions hopscotched across a large section of the surface leaping from one terminal to the next biggs had already shot pastthe area of disturbance but his companion following slightly behind received a fulldose of whatever energy was running wild down there 
 got a problem porkins announced my running was an understatement every instrument on his control panels had abruptlygone berserk 
 blue four advised biggs blue four do you read 
 okay porkins replied i can hold her give me a little room to 
 too low his companion yelled pull up pull up 
 with his instrumentation not providing proper information and at the altitude hewas traveling ship was simple for one of the big clumsy gun emplacementsto track it did as its designers had intended it should demise was asglorious as it was abrupt 
 it was comparatively quiet near the pole of the battle station so intense andvicious had been blue and green assault on the equator that imperialresistance had concentrated there red leader surveyed the false peace withmournful satisfaction knowing it last for long 
 blue leader this is red leader he announced into his mike startingour attack run the exhaust port is located and marked no flak no enemy fightersup looks like get at least one smooth run at it 
 i copy red leader the voice of his counterpart responded try tokeep them busy down here 
 three fighters dropped out of the stars diving toward the at the last possible minute they swerved to dip into a deep artificial of many streaking the northern pole of the death star metal ramparts raced paston three sides of them 
 red leader hunted around notice the temporary absence of imperial adjusted a control and addressed his squadron 
 this is it boys remember when you think close go in closer beforeyou drop that rock switch all power to front deflector mind whatthey throw at your from the side we worry about that now 
 imperial crews lining the trench rudely awoke to the fact that their heretoforeignored section of the station was coming under attack they reacted speedily andsoon energy bolts were racing at the attacking ships in a steadily increasing on would explode near one of the onrushing jostling it withoutreal damage 
 a little aggressive they red two reported over his mike 
 red leader reacted quietly how many guns do you think red five 
 red five known casually to most of the rebel pilots as pops somehow managedto make an estimate of the defenses while simultaneously piloting his fighterthrough the growing hail of fire his helmet was battered almost to the point ofuselessness from the effects of more battles than anyone had a right to survive 
 say about twenty emplacements he finally decided some in the surfaceand some on the towers 
 red leader acknowledged the information with a grunt as he pulled visor down in front of his face explosions continued to rock thefighter switch to targeting computers he declared 
 red two came one reply computer locked in and getting a young rising excitement marked his reply 
 but the senior pilot among all the rebels red five was expectantly cool it sound like it from what he murmured half to himself nodoubt about it this is going to be some trick 
 unexpectedly all defensive fire from the surrounding emplacements eerie quiet clung to the trench as the surface continued to blur past the 
 this red two blurted looking around worriedly they 
 i like it growled red leader but there was noting to confuse theirapproach now no energy bolts to avoid 
 it was pops who was first to properly evaluate this seeming aberration on part stabilize your rear deflectors now watch for enemy fighters 
 you pinned it pops red leader admitted studying a readout here theycome three marks at 
 a mechanical voice continued to recite the shrinking distance to their target butit shrinking fast enough sitting ducks down here he observednervously 
 just have to ride it out the old man told them all we defendourselves and go for the target at the same time he fought down old reflexes as hisown screen revealed three tie fighters in precision formation diving almost verticallydown toward them 
 darth vader announced as he calmly adjusted hiscontrols the stars whipped past behind him take them myself cover me 
 red two was the first to die the young pilot never knowing what hit him neverseeing his executioner despite his experience red leader was on the verge ofpanic when he saw his wingman dissolve in flame 
 trapped down here no way to walls are too got to loosen it up somehow got 
 stay on target admonished an older voice stay on target 
 red leader took words like tonic but it was all he could do to ignore theclosing tie fighters as the two remaining continued to streak toward thetarget 
 above them vader permitted himself a moment of undisciplined pleasure as hereadjusted his targeting puter the rebel craft continued to travel a course again vader touched finger to fire control 
 something screeched in red helmet and fire started to consume hisinstrumentation no good he yelled into his pickup hit hit 
 a second exploded in a ball of vaporized metal scattering a few solidshards of debris across the trench this second loss proved too much even for redfive to take he manipulated controls and his ship commenced rising in a slowcurve out of the trench behind him the lead imperial fighter moved to follow 
 red five to blue leader he reported aborting run under heavy fire tiefighters dropped on us out of nowhere i 
 astern a silent remorseless enemy was touching a deadly button once first bolts struck just as pops had risen high enough to commence evasive he had pulled clear a few seconds too late 
 one energy beam seared his port engine igniting gas within the engine blewapart taking controls and stabilizing elements with it unable to compensate began a long graceful plunge toward the station surface 
 are you all right red five a troubled voice called over the intership system 
 lost tireelost dutch pops explained slowly tiredly they drop in behindyou and you maneuver in the trench your baby now so 
 it was the last message of many from a veteran 
 blue leader forced a crispness he feel into his voice as he tried to shuntaside the death of his old friend blue boys this is blue leader rendezvous atmark six point one all wings report in 
 blue leader this is blue ten i copy 
 blue two here wedge acknowledged coming toward you blue leader 
 luke was also waiting his turn to report when something beeped on his controlboard a glance backward confirmed the electronic warning as he spotted animperial fighter slipping in behind him 
 this is blue five he declared his ship wobbling as he tried to lose the tiefighter i have a problem here be right with you 
 he sent his ship into a steep dive toward the metal surface then cut sharply up toavoid a burst of defensive fire from emplacements below neither maneuver shookhis pursuit 
 i see you luke came a reassuring call from biggs stay with it 
 luke looked above below and to the sides but there was no sign of his energy bolts from his trailing assailant were passing uncomfortably close 
 blast it biggs where are you 
 something appeared not to the sides or behind but almost directly in front ofhim it was bright and moving incredibly fast and then it was firing just above completely by surprise the imperial fighter came apart just as its pilot realizedwhat had happened 
 luke turned for the rendezvous mark as biggs shot past overhead good fooled me too 
 just getting started his friend announced as he twisted his ship violently toavoid the fire from below he hove into view over shoulder and executed avictory roll just point me at the target 
 back alongside indifferent bulk dodonna finished an intense discussionwith several of his principal advisors then moved to the transmitter 
 blue leader this is base one your own attack prior tocommencement have your wingmen hold back and cover for you keep half ofyour group out of range to make the next run 
 copy base on the response came blue ten blue twelve join with me 
 two ships leveled off to flank the squadron commander blue leader checkedthem out satisfied that they were positioned properly for attack run he set thegroup to follow in case they should fail 
 blue five this is blue leader luke take blue two and three with up here out of their fire and wait for my signal to start your own run 
 copy blue leader luke acknowledged trying to slow his heart the force be with you biggs wedge close it up together the threefighters assumed a tight formation high above the firefight still raging between otherrebel craft of green and yellow squadrons and the imperial gunners below 
 the horizon ahead of blue leader as he commenced his approach tothe station surface blue ten blue twelve stay back until we spot those cover me 
 all three reached the surface leveled off then arced into the wingmen dropped farther and farther behind until blue leader was seeminglyalone in the vast gray chasm 
 no defensive fire greeted him as he raced toward the distant target he foundhimself looking around nervously checking and rechecking the same instruments 
 this look right he found himself muttering 
 blue ten sounded equally concerned you should be able to pick up the targetby now 
 i know the disruption down here is unbelievable i think my instrumentsare off is this the right trench 
 suddenly intense streaks of light began to shoot close by as the trench defensesopened up near misses shook the attackers at the far end of the trench a hugetower dominated the metal ridge vomiting enormous amounts of energy at thenearing ships 
 not going to be easy with that tower up there blue leader declared by to close up a little when i tell you 
 abruptly the energy bolts ceased and all was silent and dark in the trench onceagain this is it blue leader announced trying to locate the attack from abovethat had to be coming keep your eyes open for those fighters 
 all short and scopes are blank blue ten reported tensely toomuch interference here blue five can you see them from where you are 
 attention was riveted to the surface of the station no sign of rapidly moving points of light caught his eye there they are coming inpoint three five 
 blue ten turned and looked in the indicated direction sun bounced offstabilizing fins as the tie fighters looped downward i see them 
 the right trench all right blue leader exclaimed as his tracking scopesuddenly began a steady beeping he adjusted his targeting instrumentation pullingthe visor down over his eyes almost in range targets readycoming hold them off me for a few em busy 
 but darth vader was ready setting his own fire control as he dropped like a stonetoward the trench close up the formation take them myself 
 blue twelve went first both engines blown a slight deviation in flight pathand his ship slammed into the trench wall blue ten showed and drunkenly but could do little within the confines of those metal walls 
 i hold them long better fire while you can blue on you 
 the squadron commander was wholly absorbed in lining up two circles withinhis targeting visor almost home steady steady 
 blue ten glanced around frantically right behind me 
 blue leader was amazed at how calm he was the targeting device was partlyresponsible enabling him to concentrate on tiny abstract images to the exclusion ofall else helping him to shut out the rest of the inimical universe 
 almost there almost there he whispered then the two circles red and a steady buzzing sounded in his helmet torpedoes away torpedoesaway 
 immediately after blue ten let his own missiles loose both fighters pulled upsharply just clearing the end of the trench as several explosions billowed in theirwake 
 a hit done it blue ten shouted hysterically 
 blue reply was thick with disappointment no we go in they just exploded on the surface outside the shaft 
 disappointment killed them too as they neglected to watch behind pursuing imperial fighters continued up out of the fading light from the torpedoexplosions blue ten fell to precision fire then the dark lord changedcourse slightly to fall in behind the squadron commander 
 take the last one he announced coldly you two go back 
 luke was trying to pick the assault team out of the glowing gases below whenblue voice sounded over the communicator 
 blue five this is blue leader move into position luke start your low and wait until right on top of it not going to be easy 
 are you all right 
 on top of shake them 
 blue five to blue pack luke ordered go the three ships peeled offand plunged toward the trench sector 
 meanwhile vader finally succeeded in hitting his quarry a glancing bolt thatnonetheless started small intense explosions in one engine its r unit scrambledback toward the damaged wing and struggled to repair the crippled power plant 
 r shut off the main feed to starboard engine blue leaderdirected quietly staring resignedly at instruments which were running on tight this could get rough 
 luke saw that blue leader was in trouble right above you blueleader he declared turn to point oh five and cover for you 
 lost my upper starboard engine came the reply 
 come down for you 
 negative negative stay there and get set up for your attack run 
 sure all right 
 i think sostand by for a minute 
 actually it was somehow less than a minute before blue gyrating plowed into the surface of the station luke watched the huge explosiondissipate below him knowing without question its cause sensing fully for the firsttime the helplessness of his situation we just lost blue leader he murmuredabsently not particularly caring if his mike picked up the somber announcement 
 on yavin four leia organa rose from her chair and nervously began pacing theroom normally perfect nails were now jagged and uneven from nervous was the only indication of physical unease the anxiety visible in her expressionwas far more revealing of her feelings and anxiety and worry that filled the war roomon the announcement of blue death 
 can they go on she finally asked dodonna 
 the general replied with gentle resolve they must 
 but lost so many without blue or red leader how will theyregroup 
 dodonna was about to reply but held his words as more critical ones soundedover the speaker 
 close it up wedge luke was saying thousands of kilometers away are you 
 coming right behind you 
 wedge replied soon after okay boss in position 
 gaze went to leia he looked concerned 
 the three moved close together high above the battle studied his instruments and fought irritably with one control that appeared to bemalfunctioning 
 voice sounded in his ears it was a voice a familiar content confident and voice he had listened to intently on thedesert of tatooine and in the guts of the station below once upon a time 
 trust your feelings luke was all the voice said 
 luke tapped his helmet unsure whether he had heard anything or not this wasno time for introspection the steely horizon of the station tilted behind him 
 wedge biggs going in he hold his wingmen go in full mind finding the trench and then accelerating maybe that will keep thosefighters far enough behind us 
 stay far enough back to cover you biggs declared at that speed willyou be able to pull out in time 
 are you kidding luke sneered playfully as they began their dive toward thesurface be just like beggars canyon back home 
 right with you boss noted wedge emphasizing the title for the first go 
 at high speed the three slim fighters charged the glowing surface pulling outafter the last moment luke skimmed so close over the station hull that the tip ofone wing grazed a protruding antenna sending metal splinters flying instantly theywere enveloped in a meshwork of energy bolts and explosive projectiles itintensified as they dropped down into the trench we seemed to have upset them biggs chortled treating the deadly display ofenergy as though it were all a show being put on for their amusement 
 this is fine luke commented surprised at the clear view ahead i can seeeverything 
 wedge quite as confident as he studied his own readouts my scopeshows the tower but i make out the exhaust port it must be awfully you sure the computer can target it 
 it better biggs muttered 
 luke offer an was too busy holding a course through theturbulence produced by exploding bolts then as if on command the defensive fireceased he glanced around and up for sign of the expected tie fighters but sawnothing 
 his hand went to drop the targeting visor into position and for just a moment hehesitated then he swung it down in front of his eyes watch yourselves heordered his companions 
 what about the tower wedge asked worriedly 
 you worry about those fighter luke snapped worry about the tower 
 they rushed on closing on the target every second wedge stared upward andhis gaze suddenly froze here they point three 
 vader was setting his controls when one of his wingmen broke attack making their approach too never get out in time 
 stay with them vader commanded 
 going too fast to get a fix his other pilot announced with certainty 
 vader studied several readouts and found that his sensors confirmed the otherestimates still have to slow down before they reach that tower 
 luke contemplated the view in his targeting visor almost home secondspassed and the twin circlets achieved congruence his finger convulsed on the firingcontrol torpedoes away pull up pull up 
 two powerful explosions rocked the trench striking harmlessly far to one side ofthe minute opening three tie fighters shot out of the rapidly dissipating on the retreating rebels take them vader ordered softly 
 luke detected the pursuit at the same time as his companions wedge the only way shake them 
 the three ships dropped toward the station then abruptly raced off in threedifferent directions all three tie fighters turned and followed luke 
 vader fired on the crazily dodging ship missed and frowned to himself theforce is strong with this one strange take him myself 
 luke darted between defensive towers and wove a tight path around projectingdocking bays all to no avail a single remaining tie fighter stayed close energy bolt nicked one wing close by an engine it started to spark luke fought to compensate and retain full control 
 still trying to shake his persistent assailant he dropped back into a trench hit he announced but not bad artoo see what you can do with it 
 the tiny droid unlocked himself and moved to work on the damaged engine asenergy bolts flashed by dangerously close hang on back there luke counseledthe artoo unit as he worked a path around projecting towers the fighter spinning andtwisting tightly through the topography of the station 
 fire remained intense as luke randomly changed direction and speed a seriesof indicators on the control panel slowly changed color three vital gauges relaxed andreturned to where they belonged 
 i think got it artoo luke told him gratefully i just try to lock it down so it work loose again 
 artoo beeped in reply while luke studied the whirling panorama behind andabove them i think lost those fighters too blue group this is blue you clear he manipulated several controls and the shot out of thetrench still followed by emplacement fire 
 up here waiting boss wedge announced from his position high above thestation i see you 
 on my way blue three are you clear biggs 
 had some trouble his friend explained but i think i lost him 
 something showed again damnably on screen a glance behindshowed the tie fighter that had been chasing him for the past several minutesdropping in once more behind him he swung down toward the station again 
 nope not yet biggs told the others hold on luke be right there 
 a thin mechanical voice sounded over the speakers hold on artoo hangon back at the temple headquarters threepio turned away from the curioushuman faces which had turned to stare at him 
 as luke soared high above the station another swung in close to recognized ship and began hunting around anxiously for his friend 
 goin in up biggs are you all right biggs therewas no sign of the other fighter wedge do you see him anywhere 
 within the transparent canopy of the fighter bobbing close by a helmeted headshook slowly nothing wedge told him over the communicator wait a littlelonger show 
 luke looked around worried studied several instruments then came to adecision we wait got to go now i think he made it 
 hey you guys a cheerful voice demanded to another ship racing past andslowing slightly ahead of him ever give up on old biggs the intercomdirected as the figure in the ahead looked back at them 
 within the central control room of the battle station a harried officer rushed upto a figure studying the great battle screen and waved a handful of printout at him 
 sir completed an analysis of their attack plan there is a we break off the engagement or make plans to evacuate your ship isstanding by 
 governor tarkin turned an incredulous gaze on the officer who shrank he roared at our moment of triumph we are about to destroy thelast remnants of the alliance and you call for evacuation you overestimate theirchances badlynow get out 
 overwhelmed by the fury the subdued officer turned and retreatedfrom the room 
 going in luke declared as he commenced his dive toward the and biggs followed just aft 
 a voice he had heard before sounded inside his head againhe tapped his helmet and looked around it sounded as if the speaker were standingjust behind him but there was nothing only silent metal and nonverbalinstrumentation puzzled luke turned back to his controls 
 once more energy bolts reached out for them passing harmlessly on both sidesas the surface of the battle station charged up into his face but the defensive the cause of the renewed trembling luke suddenly experienced severalcritical gauges were beginning their swing back into the danger zone again 
 he leaned toward the pickup artoo those stabilizing elements must havebroken loose again see if you lock it back got to have fullcontrol 
 ignoring the bumpy ride the energy beams and explosions lighting space aroundhim the little robot moved to repair the damage 
 additional tireless explosions continued to buffet the three fighters as theydropped into the trench biggs and wedge dropped behind to cover for luke as hereached to pull down the targeting visor 
 for the second time a peculiar hesitation swept through him his hand wasslower yet as he finally pulled the device down in front of his eyes almost as if thenerves were in conflict with one another as expected the energy beams stopped asif on signal and he was barreling down the trench unchallenged 
 here we go again wedge declared as he spotted three imperial fightersdropping down on them 
 biggs and wedge began crossing behind luke trying to draw the coming fireaway from him and confuse their pursuers one tie fighter ignored the to gain inexorably on the rebel ships 
 luke stared into the targeting reached up slowly to move it a long minute he pondered the deactivated instrument staring at it as ifhypnotized then he slid it sharply back in front of his face and studied the tinyscreen as it displayed the shifting relationship of the to the nearing exhaustport 
 hurry luke biggs called out as he wrenched his ship in time to narrowlyavoid a powerful beam coming in faster this time we hold themmuch longer 
 with inhuman precision darth vader depressed the fire control of his fighteragain a loud desperate shout sounded over the speakers blending into a finalagonized scream of flesh and metal as fighter burst into a billion glowingsplinters that rained down on the bottom of the trench 
 wedge heard the explosion over his speakers and hunted frantically behind himfor the trailing enemy ship we lost biggs he yelled toward his own pickup 
 luke reply immediately his eyes were watering and he angrily wipedthem clear they were blurring his view of the targeting readout 
 a couple of shooting stars biggs he whispered huskily and be stopped his ship rocked slightly from a near miss and he directed hiswords to his remaining wingman biting down hard on the end of each sentence 
 close it up wedge you do any more good back there artoo try togive me a little more power on our rear reflectors 
 the artoo unit hurried to comply as wedge pulled up alongside trailing tie fighters also increased their speed 
 on the leader vader informed his soldiers take the other one 
 luke flew just in front of wedge slightly to port side energy bolts from thepursuing imperials began to streak close about them both men crossed each repeatedly striving to present as confusing a target as possible 
 wedge was fighting with his controls when several small flashes and sparks lithis control board one small panel exploded leaving molten slag he managed to retain control of the ship 
 got a bad malfunction luke i stay with you 
 okay wedge get clear 
 wedge mumbled a heartfelt sorry and peeled up out of the trench 
 vader concentrating his attention on the one ship remaining before him fired 
 luke see the explosion which burst close behind him nordid he have time to examine the smoking shell of twisted metal which now rodealongside one engine the arms went limp on the little droid 
 all three tie fighters continued to chase the remaining down the was only a matter of moments before one of them caught the bobbing fighter with acrippling burst except now there were only two imperial pursuing the third hadbecome an expanding cylinder of decomposing debris bits and pieces of whichslammed into the walls of the canyon 
 remaining wingman looked around in panic for the source of the same distortion fields that confused rebel instrumentation now did likewise to thetwo tie fighters 
 only when the fighter fully eclipsed the sun forward did the new threat becomevisible it was a corellian transport far larger than any fighter and it was divingdirectly at the trench but it move precisely like a freighter somehow 
 whoever was piloting that vehicle must have been unconscious or out of hismind the wingman decided wildly he adjusted controls in an attempt to avoid theanticipated collision the freighter swept by just overhead but in missing it thewingman slid too far to one side 
 a small explosion followed as two huge fins of the paralleling tie fightersintersected screaming uselessly into his pickup the wingman fluttered toward thenear trench wall he never touched it his ship erupting in flame before contact 
 to the other side darth fighter began spinning by the dark desperate glower various controls and instrumentsgave back readings which were brutally truthful completely out of control the tinyship continued spinning in the opposite direction from the destroyed the endless reaches of deep space 
 whoever was at the controls of the supple freighter was neither unconscious perhaps slightly touched but fully in command nonetheless it soaredhigh above the trench turning to run protectively above luke 
 all clear now kid a familiar voice informed him now blow thisthing so we can all go home 
 this pep talk was followed by a reinforcing grunt which could only have beenproduced by a particularly large wookie 
 luke looked up through the canopy and smiled but his smile faded as heturned back to the targeting visor there was a tickling inside his head 
 luketrust me the tickle requested forming words for the third time hestared into the targeter the emergency exhaust port was sliding toward the firingcircle again as it had once missed he hesitated but only brieflythis time then shoved the targeting screen aside closing his eyes he appeared tomumble to himself as if in internal conversation with something unseen with theconfidence of a blind man in familiar surroundings luke moved a thumb over severalcontrols then touched one soon after a concerned voice filled the cockpit from theopen speakers 
 base one to blue five your targeting device is switched off wrong 
 nothing luke murmured barely audible nothing 
 he blinked and cleared his eyes had he been asleep looking around hesaw that he was out of the trench and shooting back into open space a glanceoutside showed the familiar shape of han ship shadowing him another atthe control board indicated that he had released his remaining torpedoes although remember touching the firing stud still he must have 
 the cockpit speakers were alive with excitement you did it you did was shouting over and over i think they went right in 
 good shot kid solo complimented him having to raise his voice to be heardover unrestrained howling 
 distant muted rumblings shook ship an omen of incipient success hemust have fired the torpedoes he gradually he regained his composure 
 gladyou were here to see it now get some distance between us andthat thing before it goes i hope wedge was right 
 several and one freighter accelerated awayfrom the battle station racing toward the distant curve of yavin 
 behind them small flashes of fading light marked the receding station withoutwarning something appeared in the sky in place of it which was brighter than theglowing gas giant brighter than its sun for a few seconds the eternal nightbecame day no one dared look directly at it not even multiple shields set on highcould dim that awesome flare 
 space filled temporarily with trillions of microscopic metal fragments propelledpast the retreating ships by the liberated energy of a small artificial sun thecollapsed residue of the battle station would continued to consume itself for severaldays forming for that brief span of time the most impressive tombstone in this cornerof the cosmos

 leia organa sat silently before the huge display screen on which yavin and its moonswere displayed a large red dot moved steadily toward the fourth of those and several other field commanders of the alliance stood behind her theireyes also intent on the screen tiny green flecks began to appear around the fourthmoon to coalesce into the small clouds like hovering emerald put a hand on her shoulder it was comforting the red represents theprogress of the imperial battle station as it moves deeper into system 
 our ships are all away a commander behind him declared 
 a single man stood alone in the cylindrical hold secured to the top of a tower staring through electrobinoculars he was the sole visiblerepresentative of the vast technology buried in the green purgatory below 
 muted cries moans and primeval gurglings drifted up to him from the highesttreetops some were frightening some less so but none were as indicative of powerheld in check as the four silvery starships which burst into view above the a tight formation they exploded through humid air to vanish in seconds intothe morning cloud cover far above rattled the trees moments a forlorn attempt to catch up to the engines which had produced them 
 slowly assuming attack formations combining x and ships the variousfighters began to move outward from the moon out past the oceanic atmosphere ofgiant yavin out to meet the technologic executioner 
 the man who had observed the between biggs and luke now loweredhis glare visor and adjusted his gunsights as he checkedthe ships to either side of him 
 blue boys he addressed his intership pickup this is blue leader adjustyour selectors and check in approaching target at one point three 
 ahead the bright sphere of what looked like on of moons but to glow with increasing brightness it shone with an eerie metallic glowutterly unlike that of any natural satellite as he watched the giant battle stationmake its way around the rim of yavin blue thoughts traveled back over theyears over the uncountable injustices the innocents taken away for interrogationand never heard from whole multitude of evils incurred by an increasinglycorrupt and indifferent imperial government all those terrors and agonies wereconcentrated magnified represented by the single bloated feat of engineering theywere approaching now 
 this is it boys he said to the mike blue two too far out close itup wedge 
 the young pilot luke had encountered in the temple briefing room glanced tostarboard then back to his instruments he executed a slight adjustment boss my ranger seems to be a few points off have to go on manual 
 check blue two watch yourself all ships stand by to lock inattack mode 
 one after another from luke and biggs wedge and the other members of blueassault squadron the replies came back standing by 
 execute blue leader commanded when john d and piggy had indicated theywere in readiness 
 the double wings on the fighters split apart like narrow seeds eachfighter now displayed four wings its armament and quadruple enginesnow deployed for maximum firepower and maneuverability 
 ahead they imperial station continued to grow surface features becamevisible as each pilot recognized docking bays broadcast antennae and other mountains and canyons 
 as he neared that threatening black sphere for the second time breathinggrew faster automatic machinery detected the respiratory shift andcompensated properly 
 something began to buffet his ship almost as if he were back in his skyhopperagain wrestling with the unpredictable winds of tatooine he experienced a badmoment of uncertainty until the calming voice of blue leader sounded in his ears 
 passing through their outer shields hold tight lock down controls and switch your own deflectors on double front 
 the shaking and buffeting continued worsened not knowing how tocompensate luke did exactly what he should have remained in control and followedorders then the turbulence was gone and the deathly cold peacefulness of spacehad returned 
 it through blue leader told them quietly keep all channelssilent until on top of them it look like expecting muchresistance 
 though half the great station remained in shadow they were now near enoughfor luke to be able to discern individual lights on its surface a ship that could showphases matching a moononce again he marveled at the misplaced ingenuity andeffort which had gone into its construction thousands of lights scattered across itscurving expanse gave it the appearance of a floating city 
 some of comrades since this was their first sight of the station wereeven more impressed look at the size of that thing wedge antilles gasped overhis open pickup 
 cut the chatter blue two blue leader ordered accelerate to attackvelocity 
 grim determination showed in expression as he flipped several switchesabove his head and began adjusting his computer target readout artoo detooreexamined the nearing station and thought untranslatable electronic thoughts 
 blue leader compared the station with the location of their proposed target leader he called toward the pickup this is blue leader in can go right in the exhaust shaft is farther to the north keep em busydown here 
 red leader was the physical opposite of squadron commander heresembled the popular notion of a credit slim shy of face hisskills and dedication however easily matched those of his counterpart and old friend 
 starting for the target shaft now dutch stand by to take over ifanything happens 
 check red leader came the reply going to cross theirequatorial axis and try to draw their main fire may the force be with you 
 from the approaching swarm two squads of fighters broke clear the dove directly for the bulge of the station far below while the curveddown and northward over its surface 
 within the station alarm sirens began a mournful clangorous wail as personnel realized that the impregnable fortress was actually under organizedattack admiral motti and his tacticians had expected the resistance to becentered around a massive defense of the moon itself they were completelyunprepared for an offensive response consisting of dozens of tiny snub ships 
 imperial efficiency was in the process of compensating for this strategicoversight soldiers scrambled to man enormous thrummed as powerful motors aligned the huge devices for a web of annihilation began to develop the station as energy weapons electricalbolts and explosive solids ripped out at the oncoming rebel craft 
 this is blue five luke announced to his mike as he nose dived his ship in theradical attempt to confuse any electronic predictors below the gray surface of thebattle station streaked past his ports going in 
 right behind you blue five a voice recognizable as sounded inhis ears 
 the target in sights was as stable as that of the imperial defenders wasevasive bolts flew from the tiny weapons one started a huge fire on thedim surface below which would burn until the crew of the station could shut off theflow of air to the damaged section 
 glee turned to terror as he realized he swerve his craft in time toavoid passing through the fireball of unknown composition pull out luke pullout biggs was screaming at him 
 but despite commands to shift course the automatic pressors allow thenecessary centrifugal force his father plunged into the expanding balls ofsuperheated gases 
 then he was through and clear on the other side a rapid check of his controlsenabled him to relax passage through the intense heat had been insufficient todamage anything all four wings bore streaks of black carbonizedtestimony to the nearness of his escape 
 bloomed outside his ship as he swung it up and around in a sharpcurve you all right luke came concerned query 
 i got a little toasted but okay 
 a different stern voice sounded blue five warned the squadron better give yourself more lead time or going to destroy yourself as wellas the imperial construction 
 yes sir got the hang of it now like you said not exactly likeflying a skyhopper 
 energy bolts and beams continued to create a chromatic maze in thespace above the station as the rebel fighters crisscrossed back and forth over itssurface firing at whatever looked like a decent target two of the tiny craftconcentrated on a power terminal it blew up throwing electric arcsfrom the innards 
 inside troopers mechanicals and equipment were blown in all directions bysubsidiary explosions as the effects of the blast traveled back down various conduitsand cables where the explosion had hulled the station escaping atmosphere suckedhelpless soldiers and droids out into a bottomless black tomb 
 moving from position to position a figure of dark calm amid the chaos wasdarth vader a harried commander rushed up to him and reported breathlessly 
 lord vader we count at least thirty of them of two types they are so smalland quick the fixed guns cannot follow them accurately they continuously evadethe predictors 
 get all tie crews to their fighters have to go out after them and destroythem ship by ship 
 within numerous hangars red lights began flashing and an insistent alarm startedto ring ground crews worked frantically to ready ships as imperialpilots grabbed for helmets and packs 
 luke requested blue leader as he skimmed smoothly through a rain of me know when off the block 
 on my way now 
 watch yourself the voice urged over the cockpit speaker a lot offire coming from the starboard side of that deflection tower 
 on it worry luke responded confidently putting his fighter into atwisting dive he sliced once more across metal horizons antennae and smallprotruding emplacements burst into transitory flame as bolts from his wing tips struckwith deadly accuracy 
 he grinned as he pulled up and away from the surface as intense lines of energypassed through space recently vacated darned if it like hunting home in the crumbling canyons of wastes 
 biggs followed luke on a similar run even as imperial pilots prepared to liftclear of the station within the many docking bays technical crews rushed hurriedlyto unlock power cables and conclude desperate final checks 
 more care was taken in preparing a particular craft nearest one of the bay one into which darth vader barely succeeded in squeezing his huge frame onceset in the seat he slid a second set of eye shields across his face 
 the atmosphere of the war room back in the temple was one of nervousexpectancy occasional blinks and buzzes from the main battle screen soundedlouder than the soft sussuration of hopeful people trying to reassure one a far corner of the mass of flickering lights a technician leaned a little closer tohis own readouts before speaking into the pickup suspended near his mouth 
 squad squad picked up a newset of signals from the other side of the station enemy fighters coming your way 
 luke received the report at the same time as everyone else he began huntingthe sky for the predicted imperial craft his gaze dropping to his negative i see anything 
 maintain visual scanning blue leader directed with all this energy be on top of you before your scope can pick them up remember they canjam every instrument on your ship except your eyes 
 luke turned again and this time saw an imperial already pursuing an with a number luke quickly recognized 
 biggs he shouted picked one up on your tailwatch it 
 i see it came his panicked response where is he i it 
 luke watched helplessly as ship shot away from the station surface andout into clear space closely followed by the imperial the enemy vessel firedsteadily at him each successive bolt seeming to pass a little closer to hull 
 on my tight the voice sounded in cockpit i shake him 
 twisting spinning biggs looped back toward the battle station but the pilottrailing him was persistent and showed no sign of relinquishing pursuit 
 hang on biggs luke called wrenching his ship around so steeply that thestraining gyros whined coming in 
 so absorbed in his pursuit of biggs was the imperial pilot that he see rotated his own ship flipped out of the concealing gray below and dropped inbehind him 
 electronic crosshairs lined up according to the luke fired repeatedly there was a small explosion in comparedwith the enormous energies being put out by the emplacements on the surface of thebattle station but the explosion was of particular significance to three people and most particularly to the pilot of the tie fighter who was vaporized withhis ship 
 got him luke murmured 
 got one got one came a less restrained cry of triumph over theopen intercom luke identified the voice as belonging to a young pilot known asjohn d yes that was blue six chasing another imperial fighter across the metallandscape bolts jumped from the in steady succession until the tie fighterblew in half sending glittering metal fragments flying in all directions 
 good shooting blue six the squadron leader commented then he addedquickly watch out got one on your tail 
 within the cockpit the gleeful smile on the young face vanishedinstantly as he looked around unable to spot his pursuer something flared brightlynearby so close that his starboard port burst then something hit even closer and theinterior of the now open cockpit became a mass of flames 
 hit hit 
 that was all he had time to scream before oblivion took him from behind farabove and to one side blue leader saw john ship expand in fiery ball his lipsmay have whitened slightly otherwise he might as well never have seen the for all the reaction he displayed he had more important things to do 
 on the fourth moon of yavin a spacious screen chose that moment to flicker anddie much as john d had worried technicians began rushing in all turned a drawn face to leia the expectant commanders and one tall bronzedrobot 
 the receiver has failed it will take some time to fix 
 do the best you can leia snapped switch to audio only 
 someone overheard and in seconds the room was filled with the sounds ofdistant battle interspersed with the voices of those involved 
 tighten it up blue two tighten it up blue leader was saying watch thosetowers 
 heavy fire boss came to the voice of wedge antilles degrees 
 i see it pull in pull in picking up some interference 
 i believe it biggs was stammering never seen such firepower 
 pull in blue five pull in a pause then luke do you read 
 all right chief came reply got a target going tocheck it out 
 too much action down there luke biggs told him get out doyou read me luke pull out 
 break off luke ordered the deeper tones of blue leader hit toomuch interference here luke i repeat break off i see him blue two doyou see blue five 
 negative wedge replied quickly a fire zone here you my jammed blue five where are you luke are you allright 
 gone biggs started to report solemnly then his voice rose he is looks like a little fin damage but the fine 
 relief swept the war room and it was most noticeable in the face of the beautiful senator present 
 on the battle station troopers worn half to death or deafened by the concussionof the big guns were replaced by fresh crews none of them had time to wonder howthe battle was going and at the moment none of them much cared a malady shared bycommon soldiers since the dawn of history 
 luke skimmed daringly low over the surface his attention riveted on adistant metal projection 
 stick close blue five the squadron commander directed him where areyou going 
 picked up what looks like a lateral stabilizer luke replied goingto try for it 
 watch yourself blue five heavy fire in your area 
 luke ignored the warning as he headed the fighter straight toward the oddlyshaped protuberance his determination was rewarded when after saturating it withfire he saw it erupt in a spectacular ball of superhot gas 
 got it he exclaimed continuing south for another one 
 within the rebel leia listened intently she seemedsimultaneously angry and frightened finally she turned to threepio and is luke taking so many chances the tall droid reply 
 watch your back luke voice sounded over the speakers watch yourback fighters above you coming in 
 leia strained to see what she could only hear she alone help threepio was whispering to himself and keep holding on 
 luke continued his dive even as he looked back and spotted the object of close on his tail reluctantly he pulled up and away from the station his target his tormentor was good however and continued closing onhim 
 i shake him he reported 
 something cut across the sky toward both ships on him luke shoutedwedge antilles hold on 
 luke have to for very long gunnery was precise and the tiefighter vanished brightly shortly thereafter 
 good shooting wedge that was biggs again blue four going me porkins 
 right with you blue three came the other assurance 
 biggs leveled them off let go with full weaponry no one ever decided exactlywhat it was he hit but the small tower that blew up under his energy bolts wasobviously more important than it looked 
 a series of sequential explosions hopscotched across a large section of the surface leaping from one terminal to the next biggs had already shot pastthe area of disturbance but his companion following slightly behind received a fulldose of whatever energy was running wild down there 
 got a problem porkins announced my running was an understatement every instrument on his control panels had abruptlygone berserk 
 blue four advised biggs blue four do you read 
 okay porkins replied i can hold her give me a little room to 
 too low his companion yelled pull up pull up 
 with his instrumentation not providing proper information and at the altitude hewas traveling ship was simple for one of the big clumsy gun emplacementsto track it did as its designers had intended it should demise was asglorious as it was abrupt 
 it was comparatively quiet near the pole of the battle station so intense andvicious had been blue and green assault on the equator that imperialresistance had concentrated there red leader surveyed the false peace withmournful satisfaction knowing it last for long 
 blue leader this is red leader he announced into his mike startingour attack run the exhaust port is located and marked no flak no enemy fightersup looks like get at least one smooth run at it 
 i copy red leader the voice of his counterpart responded try tokeep them busy down here 
 three fighters dropped out of the stars diving toward the at the last possible minute they swerved to dip into a deep artificial of many streaking the northern pole of the death star metal ramparts raced paston three sides of them 
 red leader hunted around notice the temporary absence of imperial adjusted a control and addressed his squadron 
 this is it boys remember when you think close go in closer beforeyou drop that rock switch all power to front deflector mind whatthey throw at your from the side we worry about that now 
 imperial crews lining the trench rudely awoke to the fact that their heretoforeignored section of the station was coming under attack they reacted speedily andsoon energy bolts were racing at the attacking ships in a steadily increasing on would explode near one of the onrushing jostling it withoutreal damage 
 a little aggressive they red two reported over his mike 
 red leader reacted quietly how many guns do you think red five 
 red five known casually to most of the rebel pilots as pops somehow managedto make an estimate of the defenses while simultaneously piloting his fighterthrough the growing hail of fire his helmet was battered almost to the point ofuselessness from the effects of more battles than anyone had a right to survive 
 say about twenty emplacements he finally decided some in the surfaceand some on the towers 
 red leader acknowledged the information with a grunt as he pulled visor down in front of his face explosions continued to rock thefighter switch to targeting computers he declared 
 red two came one reply computer locked in and getting a young rising excitement marked his reply 
 but the senior pilot among all the rebels red five was expectantly cool it sound like it from what he murmured half to himself nodoubt about it this is going to be some trick 
 unexpectedly all defensive fire from the surrounding emplacements eerie quiet clung to the trench as the surface continued to blur past the 
 this red two blurted looking around worriedly they 
 i like it growled red leader but there was noting to confuse theirapproach now no energy bolts to avoid 
 it was pops who was first to properly evaluate this seeming aberration on part stabilize your rear deflectors now watch for enemy fighters 
 you pinned it pops red leader admitted studying a readout here theycome three marks at 
 a mechanical voice continued to recite the shrinking distance to their target butit shrinking fast enough sitting ducks down here he observednervously 
 just have to ride it out the old man told them all we defendourselves and go for the target at the same time he fought down old reflexes as hisown screen revealed three tie fighters in precision formation diving almost verticallydown toward them 
 darth vader announced as he calmly adjusted hiscontrols the stars whipped past behind him take them myself cover me 
 red two was the first to die the young pilot never knowing what hit him neverseeing his executioner despite his experience red leader was on the verge ofpanic when he saw his wingman dissolve in flame 
 trapped down here no way to walls are too got to loosen it up somehow got 
 stay on target admonished an older voice stay on target 
 red leader took words like tonic but it was all he could do to ignore theclosing tie fighters as the two remaining continued to streak toward thetarget 
 above them vader permitted himself a moment of undisciplined pleasure as hereadjusted his targeting puter the rebel craft continued to travel a course again vader touched finger to fire control 
 something screeched in red helmet and fire started to consume hisinstrumentation no good he yelled into his pickup hit hit 
 a second exploded in a ball of vaporized metal scattering a few solidshards of debris across the trench this second loss proved too much even for redfive to take he manipulated controls and his ship commenced rising in a slowcurve out of the trench behind him the lead imperial fighter moved to follow 
 red five to blue leader he reported aborting run under heavy fire tiefighters dropped on us out of nowhere i 
 astern a silent remorseless enemy was touching a deadly button once first bolts struck just as pops had risen high enough to commence evasive he had pulled clear a few seconds too late 
 one energy beam seared his port engine igniting gas within the engine blewapart taking controls and stabilizing elements with it unable to compensate began a long graceful plunge toward the station surface 
 are you all right red five a troubled voice called over the intership system 
 lost tireelost dutch pops explained slowly tiredly they drop in behindyou and you maneuver in the trench your baby now so 
 it was the last message of many from a veteran 
 blue leader forced a crispness he feel into his voice as he tried to shuntaside the death of his old friend blue boys this is blue leader rendezvous atmark six point one all wings report in 
 blue leader this is blue ten i copy 
 blue two here wedge acknowledged coming toward you blue leader 
 luke was also waiting his turn to report when something beeped on his controlboard a glance backward confirmed the electronic warning as he spotted animperial fighter slipping in behind him 
 this is blue five he declared his ship wobbling as he tried to lose the tiefighter i have a problem here be right with you 
 he sent his ship into a steep dive toward the metal surface then cut sharply up toavoid a burst of defensive fire from emplacements below neither maneuver shookhis pursuit 
 i see you luke came a reassuring call from biggs stay with it 
 luke looked above below and to the sides but there was no sign of his energy bolts from his trailing assailant were passing uncomfortably close 
 blast it biggs where are you 
 something appeared not to the sides or behind but almost directly in front ofhim it was bright and moving incredibly fast and then it was firing just above completely by surprise the imperial fighter came apart just as its pilot realizedwhat had happened 
 luke turned for the rendezvous mark as biggs shot past overhead good fooled me too 
 just getting started his friend announced as he twisted his ship violently toavoid the fire from below he hove into view over shoulder and executed avictory roll just point me at the target 
 back alongside indifferent bulk dodonna finished an intense discussionwith several of his principal advisors then moved to the transmitter 
 blue leader this is base one your own attack prior tocommencement have your wingmen hold back and cover for you keep half ofyour group out of range to make the next run 
 copy base on the response came blue ten blue twelve join with me 
 two ships leveled off to flank the squadron commander blue leader checkedthem out satisfied that they were positioned properly for attack run he set thegroup to follow in case they should fail 
 blue five this is blue leader luke take blue two and three with up here out of their fire and wait for my signal to start your own run 
 copy blue leader luke acknowledged trying to slow his heart the force be with you biggs wedge close it up together the threefighters assumed a tight formation high above the firefight still raging between otherrebel craft of green and yellow squadrons and the imperial gunners below 
 the horizon ahead of blue leader as he commenced his approach tothe station surface blue ten blue twelve stay back until we spot those cover me 
 all three reached the surface leveled off then arced into the wingmen dropped farther and farther behind until blue leader was seeminglyalone in the vast gray chasm 
 no defensive fire greeted him as he raced toward the distant target he foundhimself looking around nervously checking and rechecking the same instruments 
 this look right he found himself muttering 
 blue ten sounded equally concerned you should be able to pick up the targetby now 
 i know the disruption down here is unbelievable i think my instrumentsare off is this the right trench 
 suddenly intense streaks of light began to shoot close by as the trench defensesopened up near misses shook the attackers at the far end of the trench a hugetower dominated the metal ridge vomiting enormous amounts of energy at thenearing ships 
 not going to be easy with that tower up there blue leader declared by to close up a little when i tell you 
 abruptly the energy bolts ceased and all was silent and dark in the trench onceagain this is it blue leader announced trying to locate the attack from abovethat had to be coming keep your eyes open for those fighters 
 all short and scopes are blank blue ten reported tensely toomuch interference here blue five can you see them from where you are 
 attention was riveted to the surface of the station no sign of rapidly moving points of light caught his eye there they are coming inpoint three five 
 blue ten turned and looked in the indicated direction sun bounced offstabilizing fins as the tie fighters looped downward i see them 
 the right trench all right blue leader exclaimed as his tracking scopesuddenly began a steady beeping he adjusted his targeting instrumentation pullingthe visor down over his eyes almost in range targets readycoming hold them off me for a few em busy 
 but darth vader was ready setting his own fire control as he dropped like a stonetoward the trench close up the formation take them myself 
 blue twelve went first both engines blown a slight deviation in flight pathand his ship slammed into the trench wall blue ten showed and drunkenly but could do little within the confines of those metal walls 
 i hold them long better fire while you can blue on you 
 the squadron commander was wholly absorbed in lining up two circles withinhis targeting visor almost home steady steady 
 blue ten glanced around frantically right behind me 
 blue leader was amazed at how calm he was the targeting device was partlyresponsible enabling him to concentrate on tiny abstract images to the exclusion ofall else helping him to shut out the rest of the inimical universe 
 almost there almost there he whispered then the two circles red and a steady buzzing sounded in his helmet torpedoes away torpedoesaway 
 immediately after blue ten let his own missiles loose both fighters pulled upsharply just clearing the end of the trench as several explosions billowed in theirwake 
 a hit done it blue ten shouted hysterically 
 blue reply was thick with disappointment no we go in they just exploded on the surface outside the shaft 
 disappointment killed them too as they neglected to watch behind pursuing imperial fighters continued up out of the fading light from the torpedoexplosions blue ten fell to precision fire then the dark lord changedcourse slightly to fall in behind the squadron commander 
 take the last one he announced coldly you two go back 
 luke was trying to pick the assault team out of the glowing gases below whenblue voice sounded over the communicator 
 blue five this is blue leader move into position luke start your low and wait until right on top of it not going to be easy 
 are you all right 
 on top of shake them 
 blue five to blue pack luke ordered go the three ships peeled offand plunged toward the trench sector 
 meanwhile vader finally succeeded in hitting his quarry a glancing bolt thatnonetheless started small intense explosions in one engine its r unit scrambledback toward the damaged wing and struggled to repair the crippled power plant 
 r shut off the main feed to starboard engine blue leaderdirected quietly staring resignedly at instruments which were running on tight this could get rough 
 luke saw that blue leader was in trouble right above you blueleader he declared turn to point oh five and cover for you 
 lost my upper starboard engine came the reply 
 come down for you 
 negative negative stay there and get set up for your attack run 
 sure all right 
 i think sostand by for a minute 
 actually it was somehow less than a minute before blue gyrating plowed into the surface of the station luke watched the huge explosiondissipate below him knowing without question its cause sensing fully for the firsttime the helplessness of his situation we just lost blue leader he murmuredabsently not particularly caring if his mike picked up the somber announcement 
 on yavin four leia organa rose from her chair and nervously began pacing theroom normally perfect nails were now jagged and uneven from nervous was the only indication of physical unease the anxiety visible in her expressionwas far more revealing of her feelings and anxiety and worry that filled the war roomon the announcement of blue death 
 can they go on she finally asked dodonna 
 the general replied with gentle resolve they must 
 but lost so many without blue or red leader how will theyregroup 
 dodonna was about to reply but held his words as more critical ones soundedover the speaker 
 close it up wedge luke was saying thousands of kilometers away are you 
 coming right behind you 
 wedge replied soon after okay boss in position 
 gaze went to leia he looked concerned 
 the three moved close together high above the battle studied his instruments and fought irritably with one control that appeared to bemalfunctioning 
 voice sounded in his ears it was a voice a familiar content confident and voice he had listened to intently on thedesert of tatooine and in the guts of the station below once upon a time 
 trust your feelings luke was all the voice said 
 luke tapped his helmet unsure whether he had heard anything or not this wasno time for introspection the steely horizon of the station tilted behind him 
 wedge biggs going in he hold his wingmen go in full mind finding the trench and then accelerating maybe that will keep thosefighters far enough behind us 
 stay far enough back to cover you biggs declared at that speed willyou be able to pull out in time 
 are you kidding luke sneered playfully as they began their dive toward thesurface be just like beggars canyon back home 
 right with you boss noted wedge emphasizing the title for the first go 
 at high speed the three slim fighters charged the glowing surface pulling outafter the last moment luke skimmed so close over the station hull that the tip ofone wing grazed a protruding antenna sending metal splinters flying instantly theywere enveloped in a meshwork of energy bolts and explosive projectiles itintensified as they dropped down into the trench we seemed to have upset them biggs chortled treating the deadly display ofenergy as though it were all a show being put on for their amusement 
 this is fine luke commented surprised at the clear view ahead i can seeeverything 
 wedge quite as confident as he studied his own readouts my scopeshows the tower but i make out the exhaust port it must be awfully you sure the computer can target it 
 it better biggs muttered 
 luke offer an was too busy holding a course through theturbulence produced by exploding bolts then as if on command the defensive fireceased he glanced around and up for sign of the expected tie fighters but sawnothing 
 his hand went to drop the targeting visor into position and for just a moment hehesitated then he swung it down in front of his eyes watch yourselves heordered his companions 
 what about the tower wedge asked worriedly 
 you worry about those fighter luke snapped worry about the tower 
 they rushed on closing on the target every second wedge stared upward andhis gaze suddenly froze here they point three 
 vader was setting his controls when one of his wingmen broke attack making their approach too never get out in time 
 stay with them vader commanded 
 going too fast to get a fix his other pilot announced with certainty 
 vader studied several readouts and found that his sensors confirmed the otherestimates still have to slow down before they reach that tower 
 luke contemplated the view in his targeting visor almost home secondspassed and the twin circlets achieved congruence his finger convulsed on the firingcontrol torpedoes away pull up pull up 
 two powerful explosions rocked the trench striking harmlessly far to one side ofthe minute opening three tie fighters shot out of the rapidly dissipating on the retreating rebels take them vader ordered softly 
 luke detected the pursuit at the same time as his companions wedge the only way shake them 
 the three ships dropped toward the station then abruptly raced off in threedifferent directions all three tie fighters turned and followed luke 
 vader fired on the crazily dodging ship missed and frowned to himself theforce is strong with this one strange take him myself 
 luke darted between defensive towers and wove a tight path around projectingdocking bays all to no avail a single remaining tie fighter stayed close energy bolt nicked one wing close by an engine it started to spark luke fought to compensate and retain full control 
 still trying to shake his persistent assailant he dropped back into a trench hit he announced but not bad artoo see what you can do with it 
 the tiny droid unlocked himself and moved to work on the damaged engine asenergy bolts flashed by dangerously close hang on back there luke counseledthe artoo unit as he worked a path around projecting towers the fighter spinning andtwisting tightly through the topography of the station 
 fire remained intense as luke randomly changed direction and speed a seriesof indicators on the control panel slowly changed color three vital gauges relaxed andreturned to where they belonged 
 i think got it artoo luke told him gratefully i just try to lock it down so it work loose again 
 artoo beeped in reply while luke studied the whirling panorama behind andabove them i think lost those fighters too blue group this is blue you clear he manipulated several controls and the shot out of thetrench still followed by emplacement fire 
 up here waiting boss wedge announced from his position high above thestation i see you 
 on my way blue three are you clear biggs 
 had some trouble his friend explained but i think i lost him 
 something showed again damnably on screen a glance behindshowed the tie fighter that had been chasing him for the past several minutesdropping in once more behind him he swung down toward the station again 
 nope not yet biggs told the others hold on luke be right there 
 a thin mechanical voice sounded over the speakers hold on artoo hangon back at the temple headquarters threepio turned away from the curioushuman faces which had turned to stare at him 
 as luke soared high above the station another swung in close to recognized ship and began hunting around anxiously for his friend 
 goin in up biggs are you all right biggs therewas no sign of the other fighter wedge do you see him anywhere 
 within the transparent canopy of the fighter bobbing close by a helmeted headshook slowly nothing wedge told him over the communicator wait a littlelonger show 
 luke looked around worried studied several instruments then came to adecision we wait got to go now i think he made it 
 hey you guys a cheerful voice demanded to another ship racing past andslowing slightly ahead of him ever give up on old biggs the intercomdirected as the figure in the ahead looked back at them 
 within the central control room of the battle station a harried officer rushed upto a figure studying the great battle screen and waved a handful of printout at him 
 sir completed an analysis of their attack plan there is a we break off the engagement or make plans to evacuate your ship isstanding by 
 governor tarkin turned an incredulous gaze on the officer who shrank he roared at our moment of triumph we are about to destroy thelast remnants of the alliance and you call for evacuation you overestimate theirchances badlynow get out 
 overwhelmed by the fury the subdued officer turned and retreatedfrom the room 
 going in luke declared as he commenced his dive toward the and biggs followed just aft 
 a voice he had heard before sounded inside his head againhe tapped his helmet and looked around it sounded as if the speaker were standingjust behind him but there was nothing only silent metal and nonverbalinstrumentation puzzled luke turned back to his controls 
 once more energy bolts reached out for them passing harmlessly on both sidesas the surface of the battle station charged up into his face but the defensive the cause of the renewed trembling luke suddenly experienced severalcritical gauges were beginning their swing back into the danger zone again 
 he leaned toward the pickup artoo those stabilizing elements must havebroken loose again see if you lock it back got to have fullcontrol 
 ignoring the bumpy ride the energy beams and explosions lighting space aroundhim the little robot moved to repair the damage 
 additional tireless explosions continued to buffet the three fighters as theydropped into the trench biggs and wedge dropped behind to cover for luke as hereached to pull down the targeting visor 
 for the second time a peculiar hesitation swept through him his hand wasslower yet as he finally pulled the device down in front of his eyes almost as if thenerves were in conflict with one another as expected the energy beams stopped asif on signal and he was barreling down the trench unchallenged 
 here we go again wedge declared as he spotted three imperial fightersdropping down on them 
 biggs and wedge began crossing behind luke trying to draw the coming fireaway from him and confuse their pursuers one tie fighter ignored the to gain inexorably on the rebel ships 
 luke stared into the targeting reached up slowly to move it a long minute he pondered the deactivated instrument staring at it as ifhypnotized then he slid it sharply back in front of his face and studied the tinyscreen as it displayed the shifting relationship of the to the nearing exhaustport 
 hurry luke biggs called out as he wrenched his ship in time to narrowlyavoid a powerful beam coming in faster this time we hold themmuch longer 
 with inhuman precision darth vader depressed the fire control of his fighteragain a loud desperate shout sounded over the speakers blending into a finalagonized scream of flesh and metal as fighter burst into a billion glowingsplinters that rained down on the bottom of the trench 
 wedge heard the explosion over his speakers and hunted frantically behind himfor the trailing enemy ship we lost biggs he yelled toward his own pickup 
 luke reply immediately his eyes were watering and he angrily wipedthem clear they were blurring his view of the targeting readout 
 a couple of shooting stars biggs he whispered huskily and be stopped his ship rocked slightly from a near miss and he directed hiswords to his remaining wingman biting down hard on the end of each sentence 
 close it up wedge you do any more good back there artoo try togive me a little more power on our rear reflectors 
 the artoo unit hurried to comply as wedge pulled up alongside trailing tie fighters also increased their speed 
 on the leader vader informed his soldiers take the other one 
 luke flew just in front of wedge slightly to port side energy bolts from thepursuing imperials began to streak close about them both men crossed each repeatedly striving to present as confusing a target as possible 
 wedge was fighting with his controls when several small flashes and sparks lithis control board one small panel exploded leaving molten slag he managed to retain control of the ship 
 got a bad malfunction luke i stay with you 
 okay wedge get clear 
 wedge mumbled a heartfelt sorry and peeled up out of the trench 
 vader concentrating his attention on the one ship remaining before him fired 
 luke see the explosion which burst close behind him nordid he have time to examine the smoking shell of twisted metal which now rodealongside one engine the arms went limp on the little droid 
 all three tie fighters continued to chase the remaining down the was only a matter of moments before one of them caught the bobbing fighter with acrippling burst except now there were only two imperial pursuing the third hadbecome an expanding cylinder of decomposing debris bits and pieces of whichslammed into the walls of the canyon 
 remaining wingman looked around in panic for the source of the same distortion fields that confused rebel instrumentation now did likewise to thetwo tie fighters 
 only when the fighter fully eclipsed the sun forward did the new threat becomevisible it was a corellian transport far larger than any fighter and it was divingdirectly at the trench but it move precisely like a freighter somehow 
 whoever was piloting that vehicle must have been unconscious or out of hismind the wingman decided wildly he adjusted controls in an attempt to avoid theanticipated collision the freighter swept by just overhead but in missing it thewingman slid too far to one side 
 a small explosion followed as two huge fins of the paralleling tie fightersintersected screaming uselessly into his pickup the wingman fluttered toward thenear trench wall he never touched it his ship erupting in flame before contact 
 to the other side darth fighter began spinning by the dark desperate glower various controls and instrumentsgave back readings which were brutally truthful completely out of control the tinyship continued spinning in the opposite direction from the destroyed the endless reaches of deep space 
 whoever was at the controls of the supple freighter was neither unconscious perhaps slightly touched but fully in command nonetheless it soaredhigh above the trench turning to run protectively above luke 
 all clear now kid a familiar voice informed him now blow thisthing so we can all go home 
 this pep talk was followed by a reinforcing grunt which could only have beenproduced by a particularly large wookie 
 luke looked up through the canopy and smiled but his smile faded as heturned back to the targeting visor there was a tickling inside his head 
 luketrust me the tickle requested forming words for the third time hestared into the targeter the emergency exhaust port was sliding toward the firingcircle again as it had once missed he hesitated but only brieflythis time then shoved the targeting screen aside closing his eyes he appeared tomumble to himself as if in internal conversation with something unseen with theconfidence of a blind man in familiar surroundings luke moved a thumb over severalcontrols then touched one soon after a concerned voice filled the cockpit from theopen speakers 
 base one to blue five your targeting device is switched off wrong 
 nothing luke murmured barely audible nothing 
 he blinked and cleared his eyes had he been asleep looking around hesaw that he was out of the trench and shooting back into open space a glanceoutside showed the familiar shape of han ship shadowing him another atthe control board indicated that he had released his remaining torpedoes although remember touching the firing stud still he must have 
 the cockpit speakers were alive with excitement you did it you did was shouting over and over i think they went right in 
 good shot kid solo complimented him having to raise his voice to be heardover unrestrained howling 
 distant muted rumblings shook ship an omen of incipient success hemust have fired the torpedoes he gradually he regained his composure 
 gladyou were here to see it now get some distance between us andthat thing before it goes i hope wedge was right 
 several and one freighter accelerated awayfrom the battle station racing toward the distant curve of yavin 
 behind them small flashes of fading light marked the receding station withoutwarning something appeared in the sky in place of it which was brighter than theglowing gas giant brighter than its sun for a few seconds the eternal nightbecame day no one dared look directly at it not even multiple shields set on highcould dim that awesome flare 
 space filled temporarily with trillions of microscopic metal fragments propelledpast the retreating ships by the liberated energy of a small artificial sun thecollapsed residue of the battle station would continued to consume itself for severaldays forming for that brief span of time the most impressive tombstone in this cornerof the cosmos

 when natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was already growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming at once when she heard the young discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there 
 boris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face natasha very still peered out from her ambush waiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before the glass smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about to call him but changed her mind let him look for me thought she hardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears and muttering angrily came in at the other door natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her and remained in her hiding place watching as under an invisible cap to see what went on in the world she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering to herself kept looking round toward the door it opened and nicholas came in 
 sonya what is the matter with you how can you said he running up to her 
 nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sonya 
 ah i know what it is 
 well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her 
 look here how can you torture me and yourself like that for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand 
 sonya did not pull it away and left off crying natasha not stirring and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes what will happen now thought she 
 sonya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are everything said nicholas and i will prove it to you 
 i like you to talk like that 
 well then i only forgive me sonya he drew her to him and kissed her 
 oh how nice thought natasha and when sonya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called boris to her 
 boris come here said she with a sly and significant look i have something to tell you here here and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding 
 boris followed her smiling 
 what is the something asked he 
 she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs picked it up 
 kiss the doll said she 
 boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not reply 
 you want to well then come here said she and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll closer closer she whispered 
 she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face 
 and me would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from excitement 
 boris blushed 
 how funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still more but he waited and did nothing 
 suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing back her hair kissed him full on the lips 
 then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood hanging her head 
 natasha he said you know that i love you but 
 you are in love with me natasha broke in 
 yes i am but please let us do like that in another four years then i will ask for your hand 
 natasha considered 
 thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender little fingers all right then settled 
 a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face 
 settled replied boris 
 forever said the little girl till death itself 
 she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room

 chapter 
 
 for two months the fugitives remained absent in those two months mrs linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than edgar tended her day and night he was watching and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict and though kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future fact that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of knew no limits in gratitude and joy when life was declared out of danger and hour after hour he would sit beside her tracing the gradual return to bodily health and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also and she would soon be entirely her former self 
 the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march mr linton had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of golden crocuses her eye long stranger to any gleam of pleasure caught them in waking and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together 
 these are the earliest flowers at the heights she exclaimed they remind me of soft thaw winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow edgar is there not a south wind and is not the snow almost gone 
 the snow is quite gone down here darling replied her husband and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors the sky is blue and the larks are singing and the becks and brooks are all brim full catherine last spring at this time i was longing to have you under this roof now i wish you were a mile or two up those hills the air blows so sweetly i feel that it would cure you 
 i shall never be there but once more said the invalid and then leave me and i shall remain for ever next spring long again to have me under this roof and look back and think you were happy today 
 linton lavished on her the kindest caresses and tried to cheer her by the fondest words but vaguely regarding the flowers she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding we knew she was really better and therefore decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency and it might be partially removed by a change of scene the master told me to light a fire in the parlour and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window and then he brought her down and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat and as we expected revived by the objects round her which though familiar were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber by evening she seemed greatly exhausted yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed till another room could be prepared to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs we fitted up this where you lie at present on the same floor with the parlour and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other leaning on arm ah i thought myself she might recover so waited on as she was and there was double cause to desire it for on her existence depended that of another we cherished the hope that in a little while mr heart would be gladdened and his lands secured from a gripe by the birth of an heir 
 i should mention that isabella sent to her brother some six weeks from her departure a short note announcing her marriage with heathcliff it appeared dry and cold but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation if her proceeding had offended him asserting that she could not help it then and being done she had now no power to repeal it linton did not reply to this i believe and in a fortnight more i got a long letter which i considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon read it for i keep it yet any relic of the dead is precious if they were valued living 
 dear ellen it begins 
 i came last night to wuthering heights and heard for the first time that catherine has been and is yet very ill i must not write to her i suppose and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him still i must write to somebody and the only choice left me is you 
 inform edgar that give the world to see his face my heart returned to thrushcross grange in hours after i left it and is there at this moment full of warm feelings for him and catherine i follow it words are underlined they need not expect me and they may draw what conclusions they please taking care however to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection 
 the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone i want to ask you two questions the first did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here i cannot recognize any sentiment which those around share with me 
 the second question i have great interest in it is mr heathcliff a man if so is he mad and if not is he a devil i tell my reasons for making this inquiry but i beseech you to explain if you can what i have married that is when you call to see me and you must call ellen very soon write but come and bring me something from edgar 
 now you shall hear how i have been received in my new home as i am led to imagine the heights will be it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts they never occupy my thoughts except at the moment when i miss them i should laugh and dance for joy if i found their absence was the total of my miseries and the rest was an unnatural dream 
 the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors by that i judged it to be six and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and the gardens and probably the place itself as well as he could so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse and your old joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face squint malignantly project his under lip and turn away then he took the two horses and led them into the stables reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate as if we lived in an ancient castle 
 heathcliff stayed to speak to him and i entered the dingy untidy hole i dare say you would not know it it is so changed since it was in your charge by the fire stood a ruffianly child strong in limb and dirty in garb with a look of catherine in his eyes and about his mouth 
 this is legal nephew i in a manner i must shake hands must kiss him it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning 
 i approached and attempting to take his chubby fist said how do you do my dear he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend shall you and i be friends hareton was my next essay at conversation 
 an oath and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not frame off rewarded my perseverance 
 hey throttler lad whispered the little wretch rousing a bulldog from its lair in a corner now wilt tuh be ganging he asked authoritatively 
 love for my life urged a compliance i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter mr heathcliff was nowhere visible and joseph whom i followed to the stables and requested to accompany me in after staring and muttering to himself screwed up his nose and replied 
 mim mim mim did iver christian body hear aught like it minching un munching how can aw tell whet ye say 
 i say i wish you to come with me into the house i cried thinking him deaf yet highly disgusted at his rudeness 
 nor nuh me i getten summat else to do he answered and continued his work moving his lantern jaws meanwhile and surveying my dress and countenance the former a great deal too fine but the latter sure as sad as he could desire with sovereign contempt 
 i walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door at which i took the liberty of knocking in hopes some more civil servant might show himself after a short suspense it was opened by a tall gaunt man without neckerchief and otherwise extremely slovenly his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders and his eyes too were like a ghostly with all their beauty annihilated 
 your business here he demanded grimly who are you 
 my name was isabella linton i replied seen me before sir lately married to mr heathcliff and he has brought me suppose by your permission 
 is he come back then asked the hermit glaring like a hungry wolf 
 came just now i said but he left me by the kitchen door and when i would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place and frightened me off by the help of a bulldog 
 well the hellish villain has kept his word growled my future host searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering heathcliff and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him 
 i repented having tried this second entrance and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing but ere i could execute that intention he ordered me in and shut and refastened the door there was a great fire and that was all the light in the huge apartment whose floor had grown a uniform grey and the once brilliant pewter dishes which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl partook of a similar obscurity created by tarnish and dust i inquired whether i might call the maid and be conducted to a bedroom mr earnshaw vouchsafed no answer he walked up and down with his hands in his pockets apparently quite forgetting my presence and his abstraction was evidently so deep and his whole aspect so misanthropical that i shrank from disturbing him again 
 not be surprised ellen at my feeling particularly cheerless seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home containing the only people i loved on earth and there might as well be the atlantic to part us instead of those four miles i could not overpass them i questioned with must i turn for comfort you tell edgar or every sorrow beside this rose despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against heathcliff i had sought shelter at wuthering heights almost gladly because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him but he knew the people we were coming amongst and he did not fear their intermeddling 
 i sat and thought a doleful time the clock struck eight and nine and still my companion paced to and fro his head bent on his breast and perfectly silent unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals i listened to detect a voice in the house and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations which at last spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping i was not aware how openly i grieved till earnshaw halted opposite in his measured walk and gave me a stare of surprise taking advantage of his recovered attention i exclaimed 
 tired with my journey and i want to go to bed where is the maidservant direct me to her as she come to me 
 we have none he answered you must wait on yourself 
 where must i sleep then i sobbed i was beyond regarding weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness 
 joseph will show you chamber said he open that in there 
 i was going to obey but he suddenly arrested me and added in the strangest tone 
 be so good as to turn your lock and draw your omit it 
 well i said but why mr earnshaw i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with heathcliff 
 look here he replied pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol having a spring knife attached to the barrel a great tempter to a desperate man is it not i cannot resist going up with this every night and trying his door if once i find it open done for i do it invariably even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him you fight against that devil for love as long as you may when the times comes not all the angels in heaven shall save him 
 i surveyed the weapon inquisitively a hideous notion struck me how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument i took it from his hand and touched the blade he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second it was not horror it was covetousness he snatched the pistol back jealously shut the knife and returned it to its concealment 
 i care if you tell him said he put him on his guard and watch for him you know the terms we are on i see his danger does not shock you 
 what has heathcliff done to you i asked in what has he wronged you to warrant this appalling hatred it be wiser to bid him quit the house 
 no thundered earnshaw should he offer to leave me a dead man persuade him to attempt it and you are a murderess am i to lose all without a chance of retrieval is hareton to be a beggar oh damnation i will have it back and have his gold too and then his blood and hell shall have his soul it will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before 
 acquainted me ellen with your old habits he is clearly on the verge of madness he was so last night at least i shuddered to be near him and thought on the moroseness as comparatively agreeable he now recommenced his moody walk and i raised the latch and escaped into the kitchen joseph was bending over the fire peering into a large pan that swung above it and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by the contents of the pan began to boil and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper and being hungry i resolved it should be eatable so crying out sharply make the porridge i removed the vessel out of his reach and proceeded to take off my hat and riding habit mr earnshaw i continued directs me to wait on myself i will not going to act the lady among you for fear i should starve 
 gooid lord he muttered sitting down and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle if tuh be fresh when aw gettin used tuh two maisters if aw mun hev a mistress set my heead loike time tuh be flitting aw niver did think tuh say t day ut aw mud lave th owld aw daht nigh at hend 
 this lamentation drew no notice from me i went briskly to work sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance it racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition the quicker the thible ran round and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation 
 thear he ejaculated hareton thah willut sup thy porridge tuh neight be nowt bud lumps as big as maw nave thear agean fling in bowl un all if aw wer yah there pale t guilp off un then hae done bang bang a marcy t bothom deaved aht 
 it was rather a rough mess i own when poured into the basins four had been provided and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy which hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip i expostulated and desired that he should have his in a mug affirming that i could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily the old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety assuring me repeatedly that the barn was every bit as good as i and every bit as wollsome and wondering how i could fashion to be so conceited meanwhile the infant ruffian continued sucking and glowered at me defyingly as he slavered into the jug 
 i shall have my supper in another room i said have you no place you call a parlour 
 parlour he echoed sneeringly parlour nay noa parlours if yah dunnut loike wer company un if yah dunnut loike maister us 
 then i shall go upstairs i answered show me a chamber i put my basin on a tray and went myself to fetch some more milk with great grumblings the fellow rose and preceded me in my ascent we mounted to the garrets he opening a door now and then to look into the apartments we passed 
 a rahm he said at last flinging back a cranky board on hinges weel eneugh tuh ate a few porridge in a pack o corn i t corner thear meeterly clane if feared uh muckying yer grand silk cloes spread yer hankerchir o t top 
 the rahm was a kind of smelling strong of malt and grain various sacks of which articles were piled around leaving a wide bare space in the middle 
 why man i exclaimed facing him angrily this is not a place to sleep in i wish to see my bedroom 
 he repeated in a tone of mockery see all t thear mine 
 he pointed into the second garret only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls and having a large low curtainless bed with an quilt at one end 
 what do i want with yours i retorted i suppose mr heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house does he 
 oh maister wenting cried he as if making a new discovery ye uh said soa at onst un then aw mud uh telled ye baht all this wark ut just one yah cannut alias keeps it locked un iver mells but hisseln 
 a nice house joseph i could not refrain from observing and pleasant inmates and i think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day i linked my fate with theirs however that is not to the present are other rooms for sake be quick and let me settle somewhere 
 he made no reply to this adjuration only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps and halting before an apartment which from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture i conjectured to be the best one there was a carpet a good one but the pattern was obliterated by dust a fireplace hung with cut paper dropping to pieces a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make but they had evidently experienced rough usage the valances hung in festoons wrenched from their rings and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side causing the drapery to trail upon the floor the chairs were also damaged many of them severely and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls i was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession when my fool of a guide announced this here is t my supper by this time was cold my appetite gone and my patience exhausted i insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge and means of repose 
 whear the divil began the religious elder the lord bless us the lord forgie us whear the hell wold ye gang ye marred wearisome nowt yah seen all bud bit uf a not another hoile tuh lig dahn in i th hahse 
 i was so vexed i flung my tray and its contents on the ground and then seated myself at the hid my face in my hands and cried

 and so he went on scolding to his den beneath taking the candle with him and i remained in the dark the period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath and bestirring myself to remove its effects an unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of throttler whom i now recognized as a son of our old skulker it had spent its whelphood at the grange and was given by my father to mr hindley i fancy it knew me it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute and then hastened to devour the porridge while i groped from step to step collecting the shattered earthenware and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket handkerchief our labours were scarcely over when i heard tread in the passage my assistant tucked in his tail and pressed to the wall i stole into the nearest doorway the endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful as i guessed by a scutter downstairs and a prolonged piteous yelping i had better luck he passed on entered his chamber and shut the door directly after joseph came up with hareton to put him to bed i had found shelter in room and the old man on seeing me said 
 rahm for boath ye un yer pride now i sud think i the hahse empty ye may hev it all to yerseln un him as allas maks a third i such ill company 
 gladly did i take advantage of this intimation and the minute i flung myself into a chair by the fire i nodded and slept my slumber was deep and sweet though over far too soon mr heathcliff awoke me he had just come in and demanded in his loving manner what i was doing there i told him the cause of my staying up so he had the key of our room in his pocket the adjective our gave mortal offence he swore it was not nor ever should be mine and not repeat his language nor describe his habitual conduct he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence i sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear yet i assure you a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens he told me of illness and accused my brother of causing it promising that i should be proxy in suffering till he could get hold of him 
 i do hate am have been a fool beware of uttering one breath of this to anyone at the grange i shall expect you every disappoint me

 chapter 
 
 for two months the fugitives remained absent in those two months mrs linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than edgar tended her day and night he was watching and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict and though kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future fact that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of knew no limits in gratitude and joy when life was declared out of danger and hour after hour he would sit beside her tracing the gradual return to bodily health and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also and she would soon be entirely her former self 
 the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march mr linton had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of golden crocuses her eye long stranger to any gleam of pleasure caught them in waking and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together 
 these are the earliest flowers at the heights she exclaimed they remind me of soft thaw winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow edgar is there not a south wind and is not the snow almost gone 
 the snow is quite gone down here darling replied her husband and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors the sky is blue and the larks are singing and the becks and brooks are all brim full catherine last spring at this time i was longing to have you under this roof now i wish you were a mile or two up those hills the air blows so sweetly i feel that it would cure you 
 i shall never be there but once more said the invalid and then leave me and i shall remain for ever next spring long again to have me under this roof and look back and think you were happy today 
 linton lavished on her the kindest caresses and tried to cheer her by the fondest words but vaguely regarding the flowers she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding we knew she was really better and therefore decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency and it might be partially removed by a change of scene the master told me to light a fire in the parlour and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window and then he brought her down and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat and as we expected revived by the objects round her which though familiar were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber by evening she seemed greatly exhausted yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed till another room could be prepared to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs we fitted up this where you lie at present on the same floor with the parlour and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other leaning on arm ah i thought myself she might recover so waited on as she was and there was double cause to desire it for on her existence depended that of another we cherished the hope that in a little while mr heart would be gladdened and his lands secured from a gripe by the birth of an heir 
 i should mention that isabella sent to her brother some six weeks from her departure a short note announcing her marriage with heathcliff it appeared dry and cold but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation if her proceeding had offended him asserting that she could not help it then and being done she had now no power to repeal it linton did not reply to this i believe and in a fortnight more i got a long letter which i considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon read it for i keep it yet any relic of the dead is precious if they were valued living 
 dear ellen it begins 
 i came last night to wuthering heights and heard for the first time that catherine has been and is yet very ill i must not write to her i suppose and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him still i must write to somebody and the only choice left me is you 
 inform edgar that give the world to see his face my heart returned to thrushcross grange in hours after i left it and is there at this moment full of warm feelings for him and catherine i follow it words are underlined they need not expect me and they may draw what conclusions they please taking care however to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection 
 the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone i want to ask you two questions the first did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here i cannot recognize any sentiment which those around share with me 
 the second question i have great interest in it is mr heathcliff a man if so is he mad and if not is he a devil i tell my reasons for making this inquiry but i beseech you to explain if you can what i have married that is when you call to see me and you must call ellen very soon write but come and bring me something from edgar 
 now you shall hear how i have been received in my new home as i am led to imagine the heights will be it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts they never occupy my thoughts except at the moment when i miss them i should laugh and dance for joy if i found their absence was the total of my miseries and the rest was an unnatural dream 
 the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors by that i judged it to be six and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and the gardens and probably the place itself as well as he could so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse and your old joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face squint malignantly project his under lip and turn away then he took the two horses and led them into the stables reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate as if we lived in an ancient castle 
 heathcliff stayed to speak to him and i entered the dingy untidy hole i dare say you would not know it it is so changed since it was in your charge by the fire stood a ruffianly child strong in limb and dirty in garb with a look of catherine in his eyes and about his mouth 
 this is legal nephew i in a manner i must shake hands must kiss him it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning 
 i approached and attempting to take his chubby fist said how do you do my dear he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend shall you and i be friends hareton was my next essay at conversation 
 an oath and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not frame off rewarded my perseverance 
 hey throttler lad whispered the little wretch rousing a bulldog from its lair in a corner now wilt tuh be ganging he asked authoritatively 
 love for my life urged a compliance i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter mr heathcliff was nowhere visible and joseph whom i followed to the stables and requested to accompany me in after staring and muttering to himself screwed up his nose and replied 
 mim mim mim did iver christian body hear aught like it minching un munching how can aw tell whet ye say 
 i say i wish you to come with me into the house i cried thinking him deaf yet highly disgusted at his rudeness 
 nor nuh me i getten summat else to do he answered and continued his work moving his lantern jaws meanwhile and surveying my dress and countenance the former a great deal too fine but the latter sure as sad as he could desire with sovereign contempt 
 i walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door at which i took the liberty of knocking in hopes some more civil servant might show himself after a short suspense it was opened by a tall gaunt man without neckerchief and otherwise extremely slovenly his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders and his eyes too were like a ghostly with all their beauty annihilated 
 your business here he demanded grimly who are you 
 my name was isabella linton i replied seen me before sir lately married to mr heathcliff and he has brought me suppose by your permission 
 is he come back then asked the hermit glaring like a hungry wolf 
 came just now i said but he left me by the kitchen door and when i would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place and frightened me off by the help of a bulldog 
 well the hellish villain has kept his word growled my future host searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering heathcliff and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him 
 i repented having tried this second entrance and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing but ere i could execute that intention he ordered me in and shut and refastened the door there was a great fire and that was all the light in the huge apartment whose floor had grown a uniform grey and the once brilliant pewter dishes which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl partook of a similar obscurity created by tarnish and dust i inquired whether i might call the maid and be conducted to a bedroom mr earnshaw vouchsafed no answer he walked up and down with his hands in his pockets apparently quite forgetting my presence and his abstraction was evidently so deep and his whole aspect so misanthropical that i shrank from disturbing him again 
 not be surprised ellen at my feeling particularly cheerless seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home containing the only people i loved on earth and there might as well be the atlantic to part us instead of those four miles i could not overpass them i questioned with must i turn for comfort you tell edgar or every sorrow beside this rose despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against heathcliff i had sought shelter at wuthering heights almost gladly because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him but he knew the people we were coming amongst and he did not fear their intermeddling 
 i sat and thought a doleful time the clock struck eight and nine and still my companion paced to and fro his head bent on his breast and perfectly silent unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals i listened to detect a voice in the house and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations which at last spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping i was not aware how openly i grieved till earnshaw halted opposite in his measured walk and gave me a stare of surprise taking advantage of his recovered attention i exclaimed 
 tired with my journey and i want to go to bed where is the maidservant direct me to her as she come to me 
 we have none he answered you must wait on yourself 
 where must i sleep then i sobbed i was beyond regarding weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness 
 joseph will show you chamber said he open that in there 
 i was going to obey but he suddenly arrested me and added in the strangest tone 
 be so good as to turn your lock and draw your omit it 
 well i said but why mr earnshaw i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with heathcliff 
 look here he replied pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol having a spring knife attached to the barrel a great tempter to a desperate man is it not i cannot resist going up with this every night and trying his door if once i find it open done for i do it invariably even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him you fight against that devil for love as long as you may when the times comes not all the angels in heaven shall save him 
 i surveyed the weapon inquisitively a hideous notion struck me how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument i took it from his hand and touched the blade he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second it was not horror it was covetousness he snatched the pistol back jealously shut the knife and returned it to its concealment 
 i care if you tell him said he put him on his guard and watch for him you know the terms we are on i see his danger does not shock you 
 what has heathcliff done to you i asked in what has he wronged you to warrant this appalling hatred it be wiser to bid him quit the house 
 no thundered earnshaw should he offer to leave me a dead man persuade him to attempt it and you are a murderess am i to lose all without a chance of retrieval is hareton to be a beggar oh damnation i will have it back and have his gold too and then his blood and hell shall have his soul it will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before 
 acquainted me ellen with your old habits he is clearly on the verge of madness he was so last night at least i shuddered to be near him and thought on the moroseness as comparatively agreeable he now recommenced his moody walk and i raised the latch and escaped into the kitchen joseph was bending over the fire peering into a large pan that swung above it and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by the contents of the pan began to boil and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper and being hungry i resolved it should be eatable so crying out sharply make the porridge i removed the vessel out of his reach and proceeded to take off my hat and riding habit mr earnshaw i continued directs me to wait on myself i will not going to act the lady among you for fear i should starve

 chapter thirteen 
 
 laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon wondering what his neighbors were about but too lazy to go and find out he was in one of his moods for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory and he was wishing he could live it over again the hot weather made him indolent and he had shirked his studies tried mr patience to the utmost displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad and after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself staring up into the green gloom of the trees above him he dreamed dreams of all sorts and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash peeping through the meshes of the hammock he saw the marches coming out as if bound on some expedition 
 what in the world are those girls about now thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors each wore a large flapping hat a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder and carried a long staff meg had a cushion jo a book beth a basket and amy a portfolio all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river 
 well cool said laurie to himself to have a picnic and never ask me they be going in the boat for they got the key perhaps they forgot it take it to them and see going on 
 though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when leaped the fence and ran after them taking the shortest way to the boathouse he waited for them to appear but no one came and he went up the hill to take an observation a grove of pines covered one part of it and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets 
 a landscape thought laurie peeping through the bushes and looking and already 
 it was a rather pretty little picture for the sisters sat together in the shady nook with sun and shadow flickering over them the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends meg sat upon her cushion sewing daintily with her white hands and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by for she made pretty things with them amy was sketching a group of ferns and jo was knitting as she read aloud a shadow passed over the face as he watched them feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit he stood so still that a squirrel busy with harvesting ran dawn a pine close beside him saw him suddenly and skipped back scolding so shrilly that beth looked up espied the wistful face behind the birches and beckoned with a reassuring smile 
 may i come in please or shall i be a bother he asked advancing slowly 
 meg lifted her eyebrows but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once of course you may we should have asked you before only we thought you care for such a game as this 
 i always like your games but if meg want me go away 
 no objection if you do something against the rules to be idle here replied meg gravely but graciously 
 much obliged do anything if let me stop a bit for as dull as the desert of sahara down there shall i sew read cone draw or do all at once bring on your bears ready and laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold 
 finish this story while i set my heel said jo handing him the book 
 was the meek answer as he began doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the busy bee society 
 the story was not a long one and when it was finished he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit 
 please could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one 
 would you tell him asked meg of her sisters 
 laugh said amy warningly 
 who cares said jo 
 i guess like it added beth 
 of course i shall i give you my word i laugh tell away jo and be afraid 
 the idea of being afraid of you well you see we used to play progress and we have been going on with it in earnest all winter and summer 
 yes i know said laurie nodding wisely 
 who told you demanded jo 
 spirits 
 no i did i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal he did like it so scold jo said beth meekly 
 you keep a secret never mind it saves trouble now 
 go on please said laurie as jo became absorbed in her work looking a trifle displeased 
 oh she tell you about this new plan of ours well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will the vacation is nearly over the stints are all done and we are ever so glad that we dawdle 
 yes i should think so and laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days mother likes to have us as much as possible so we bring our work here and have nice times for the fun of it we bring our things in these bags wear the old hats use poles to climb the hill and play pilgrims as we used to do years ago we call this hill the delectable mountain for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time 
 jo pointed and laurie sat up to examine for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide blue river the meadows on the other side far over the outskirts of the great city to the green hills that rose to meet the sky the sun was low and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some celestial city 
 how beautiful that is said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind 
 often so and we like to watch it for it is never the same but always splendid replied amy wishing she could paint it 
 jo talks about the country where we hope to live real country she means with pigs and chickens and would be nice but i wish the beautiful country up there was real and we could ever go to it said beth musingly 
 there is a lovelier country even than that where we shall go when we are good enough answered meg with her sweetest voice 
 it seems so long to wait so hard to do i want to fly away at once as those swallows fly and go in at that splendid gate

 laurie spoke excitedly and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation for he was growing up very fast and in spite of his indolent ways had a young hatred of subjection a young restless longing to try the world for himself 
 i advise you to sail away in one of your ships and never come home again till you have tried your own way said jo whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit and whose sympathy was excited by what she called wrongs

 so he is dear old fellow said laurie heartily as meg paused looking flushed and earnest with her story like grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know and to tell all his goodness to others so that they might like him brooke understand why your mother was so kind to him asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way he thought she was just perfect and talked about it for days and days and went on about you all in flaming style if ever i do get my wish you see what do for booke 
 begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out said meg sharply 
 how do you know i do miss 
 i can always tell by his face when he goes away if you have been good he looks satisfied and walks briskly if you have plagued him sober and walks slowly as if he wanted to go back and do his work better

 please be offended i meant to preach or tell tales or be silly i only thought jo was encouraging you in a feeling which be sorry for you are so kind to us we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think forgive me i meant it kindly and meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid 
 ashamed of his momentary pique laurie squeezed the kind little hand and said frankly the one to be forgiven cross and have been out of sorts all day i like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly so mind if i am grumpy sometimes i thank you all the same 
 bent on showing that he was not offended he made himself as agreeable as possible wound cotton for meg recited poetry to please jo shook down cones for beth and helped amy with her ferns proving himself a fit person to belong to the busy bee society in the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river the faint sound of a bell warned them that hannah had put the tea to draw and they would just have time to get home to supper

 chapter thirteen 
 
 laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon wondering what his neighbors were about but too lazy to go and find out he was in one of his moods for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory and he was wishing he could live it over again the hot weather made him indolent and he had shirked his studies tried mr patience to the utmost displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad and after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself staring up into the green gloom of the trees above him he dreamed dreams of all sorts and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash peeping through the meshes of the hammock he saw the marches coming out as if bound on some expedition 
 what in the world are those girls about now thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors each wore a large flapping hat a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder and carried a long staff meg had a cushion jo a book beth a basket and amy a portfolio all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river 
 well cool said laurie to himself to have a picnic and never ask me they be going in the boat for they got the key perhaps they forgot it take it to them and see going on 
 though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when leaped the fence and ran after them taking the shortest way to the boathouse he waited for them to appear but no one came and he went up the hill to take an observation a grove of pines covered one part of it and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets 
 a landscape thought laurie peeping through the bushes and looking and already 
 it was a rather pretty little picture for the sisters sat together in the shady nook with sun and shadow flickering over them the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends meg sat upon her cushion sewing daintily with her white hands and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by for she made pretty things with them amy was sketching a group of ferns and jo was knitting as she read aloud a shadow passed over the face as he watched them feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit he stood so still that a squirrel busy with harvesting ran dawn a pine close beside him saw him suddenly and skipped back scolding so shrilly that beth looked up espied the wistful face behind the birches and beckoned with a reassuring smile 
 may i come in please or shall i be a bother he asked advancing slowly 
 meg lifted her eyebrows but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once of course you may we should have asked you before only we thought you care for such a game as this 
 i always like your games but if meg want me go away 
 no objection if you do something against the rules to be idle here replied meg gravely but graciously 
 much obliged do anything if let me stop a bit for as dull as the desert of sahara down there shall i sew read cone draw or do all at once bring on your bears ready and laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold 
 finish this story while i set my heel said jo handing him the book 
 was the meek answer as he began doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the busy bee society 
 the story was not a long one and when it was finished he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit 
 please could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one 
 would you tell him asked meg of her sisters 
 laugh said amy warningly 
 who cares said jo 
 i guess like it added beth 
 of course i shall i give you my word i laugh tell away jo and be afraid 
 the idea of being afraid of you well you see we used to play progress and we have been going on with it in earnest all winter and summer 
 yes i know said laurie nodding wisely 
 who told you demanded jo 
 spirits 
 no i did i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal he did like it so scold jo said beth meekly 
 you keep a secret never mind it saves trouble now 
 go on please said laurie as jo became absorbed in her work looking a trifle displeased 
 oh she tell you about this new plan of ours well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will the vacation is nearly over the stints are all done and we are ever so glad that we dawdle 
 yes i should think so and laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days mother likes to have us as much as possible so we bring our work here and have nice times for the fun of it we bring our things in these bags wear the old hats use poles to climb the hill and play pilgrims as we used to do years ago we call this hill the delectable mountain for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time 
 jo pointed and laurie sat up to examine for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide blue river the meadows on the other side far over the outskirts of the great city to the green hills that rose to meet the sky the sun was low and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some celestial city 
 how beautiful that is said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind 
 often so and we like to watch it for it is never the same but always splendid replied amy wishing she could paint it 
 jo talks about the country where we hope to live real country she means with pigs and chickens and would be nice but i wish the beautiful country up there was real and we could ever go to it said beth musingly 
 there is a lovelier country even than that where we shall go when we are good enough answered meg with her sweetest voice 
 it seems so long to wait so hard to do i want to fly away at once as those swallows fly and go in at that splendid gate 
 get there beth sooner or later no fear of that said jo the one that will have to fight and work and climb and wait and maybe never get in after all 
 have me for company if any comfort i shall have to do a deal of traveling before i come in sight of your celestial city if i arrive late say a good word for me you beth 
 something in the face troubled his little friend but she said cheerfully with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds if people really want to go and really try all their lives i think they will get in for i believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate i always imagine it is as it is in the picture where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor christian as he comes up from the river 
 it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true and we could live in them said jo after a little pause 
 made such quantities it would be hard to choose which have said laurie lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him

 margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers and waved a brake before her face as if to disperse imaginary gnats while she said slowly i should like a lovely house full of all sorts of luxurious food pretty clothes handsome furniture pleasant people and heaps of money i am to be mistress of it and manage it as i like with plenty of servants so i never need work a bit how i should enjoy it for i be idle but do good and make everyone love me dearly

 the giant statue of anubis instantly freezes in tracks 
 and petrifies off balance starts to fall 
 slides free of talons evelyn shoves away 
 looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
 just as anubis crashes down on top of her smashing her to 
 powder and driving her into the ground 
 imhotep shrieks in rage and horror then turns and angrily 
 heads for jonathan jonathan sitting on his ass quickly 
 backpedals on his hands and heels 
 leaps to his feet sword in hand and runs for

 golden book of the living out of his hand and pins him to a 
 wall 
 runs up and swings his sword at imhotep wap

 clutching the book of the living imhotep drops jonathan and 
 spins around facing grins

 way across the cemetery slams into a gravestone

 imhotep is already striding towards him jonathan lifts up 
 his hand he has the back he smiles at evelyn 
 jonathan

 evelyn runs for jonathan 
 swings his sword and cleaves a big chunk of molten 
 flesh rot out of stomach on the outside imhotep 
 looks human but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy 
 imhotep backhands knocks him twenty feet back 
 staggers to his feet imhotep is right there clubs 
 him hard with his left arm spins through the air 
 slams into the side of a mausoleum imhotep approaches rage 
 in his eyes gets up quickly pivots and hacks into 
 head imhotep grins and punches in the 
 face is thrown back pulling his sword with him 
 he bounces hard off the mausoleum lands on his feet 
 totally knees buckling he can barely stand 
 jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book severed 
 hand still clings to it jonathan cringes in disgust evelyn 
 yanks it off throws it away then start furiously working 
 the key into the series of locks unlocking each of them 
 imhotep strides forward backs into the mausoleum 
 swings the sword imhotep tries to catch it it cleaves 
 through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm 
 no matter imhotep rips the sword away from and 
 casually flings it away 
 the golden book of the living opens with a hiss jonathan 
 holds it tight as evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
 looking for something 
 turns to run but imhotep grabs him by the throat 
 and lifts him off his feet hangs there a dazed 
 mess imhotep grins says something in ancient egyptian then 
 starts to strangle chokes about to die 
 evelyn turns and faces imhotep and reads an inscription 
 evelyn 
 kadeesh mal kadeesh mal

 of another saddlebag filled with treasure he spots a large 
 ornate staff sticking out of a wall he throws the saddlebag 
 over the staff and collapses against the wall exhausted

 down which starts a massive aural

 the mummy

 int cemetery day 
 imhotep reads from the book the rotten rock 
 back and forth chanting evelyn struggles 
 then suddenly the strange mist wafts up out of the swirling 
 hole and over to the sacred jars it passes through them and 
 into evelyn evelyn jerks as though been electrified 
 the mist passes through her and into body 
 the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist and 
 imhotepis readings reach a crescendo crusty 
 eyelids suddenly pop open evelyn stares at her in disbelief 
 rotted head turns and looks at evelyn with 
 empty sockets evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly then 
 she notices imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife 
 imhotep subtitled 
 with your death my love and 
 i will be invincible 
 he raises it up over chest about to plunge it down 
 eyes widen in horror and when 
 and jonathan burst in imhotep spins around and faces them 
 jonathan beams as he holds up the golden book of the living 
 jonathan 
 i found it evy i found it 
 evelyn 
 and get me off of here 
 grabs an ancient sword out of a hand 
 jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the priests 
 the stop chanting the mist vanishes 
 imhotep steps forward strikes the sacrificial 
 knife out of his hand imhotep bellows a command the priests 
 stand up swords and knives in hand they attack 
 everything happens at once read faster 
 evelyn

 fumbles with the book struggling to open it he 
 jonathan

 cuts two of the mummies in half then swings his 
 sword down at evelyn clang one chain breaks free 
 jonathan spots a series of solid gold locks 
 along the binder it hits him like lightning 
 jonathan

 imhotep grins then grabs the hanging from a chain 
 around his neck rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
 he picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for jonathan

 jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription 
 but his ancient egyptian is clearly awful 
 jonathan 
 
 jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery clutching 
 the golden book as imhotep moves in on him 
 jonathan 
 ebarra im hatu kashka ummmmm 
 jonathan trips and falls on his ass imhotep charges forward 
 slashes another chain only one more left holding 
 evelyn jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover 
 jonathan 
 rasheem aaaaa anubis 
 imhotep raises the sacrificial sword about to kill jonathan 
 and when the giant statue of anubis suddenly crashes 
 through the wall shades of ray harryhausen only better 
 the god of deaths horrible decrepit stone face stares 
 angrily down jonathan stares back 
 jonathan 
 oh boy 
 decapitates a mummy and looks up at anubis 
 sarcastic 
 this just keeps gettin 
 better and better 
 imhotep leaves jonathan and heads for the giant statue 
 leaps over and with one last swing of the sword 
 frees evelyn from her chains more attack 
 forcing him away evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
 head for a skeletal hand grabs her spins her 
 around rotted corpse evelyn reacts 
 
 imhotep looks up at anubis points to and in 
 ancient egyptian commands him to attack anubis moves for 
 stomping over mausoleums and through the detritus 
 moat on his way quickly backs away

 the giant statue of anubis instantly freezes in tracks 
 and petrifies off balance starts to fall 
 slides free of talons evelyn shoves away 
 looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
 just as anubis crashes down on top of her smashing her to 
 powder and driving her into the ground 
 imhotep shrieks in rage and horror then turns and angrily 
 heads for jonathan jonathan sitting on his ass quickly

 wall

 the key into the series of locks unlocking each of them 
 imhotep strides forward backs into the mausoleum 
 swings the sword imhotep tries to catch it it cleaves 
 through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm 
 no matter imhotep rips the sword away from and 
 casually flings it away 
 the golden book of the living opens with a hiss jonathan 
 holds it tight as evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
 looking for something 
 turns to run but imhotep grabs him by the throat 
 and lifts him off his feet hangs there a dazed 
 mess imhotep grins says something in ancient egyptian then 
 starts to strangle chokes about to die 
 evelyn turns and faces imhotep and reads an inscription

 mario and ann continue dancing having a great time 
 irving walks around the other side of the bar his camera placed on the table joe hiding it from the view of the floor the barman protests but irving reassures him keeping his eyes on ann irving watches waiting and then with a signal joe jumps away and the bulb flashes as irving takes the picture in an instant joe jumps back nonchalantly looking up at the sky while irving takes his glass doing the same 
 ann looks out across the floor and then seeing joe and irving waves irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement 
 on the bridge up above the dancing several cars pull up several men climb out rushing over to the steps the first secret service man smoking a cigarette watches the men approach the men walk over to the tables 
 ann continues dancing with mario who suddenly stops looking at her hair 
 
 ann

 mario delani 
 moment 
 
 he stops thinking and then taking out a comb brushes her fringe apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat tufts he puts his comb away satisfied ann moves to touch her hair but mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue dancing 
 one of the secret service men stands leaning against a structure swinging his hand to the beat smiling the man watching behind rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls his hat down putting his hands in his pockets looking out again over the dancing 
 the music stops and everyone applauds the musicians 
 
 mario delani 
 thank you 
 
 the first secret service man comes over to ann then mario seeing him says something to ann in italian then bye and leaves her to him 
 ann smiles slightly but nervously to the man and they start to dance they turn several times then the man speaks in her ear 
 
 secret service man

 she looks at up him sharply and tries to pull away but he holds her 
 dance quietly towards the entrance there is a car waiting 
 
 ann 
 desperately trying to pull away

 shouting 
 mr bradley 
 
 joe looks up and starts toward her looking for her in the dancers 
 let me go will you mr bradley 
 irving looks around from his drink and seeing the problem rushes after joe two of the secret service men drag ann away from the barges but joe catches them and pushes them away pushing one of them down and taking ann by the arm joe punches one man who tries to pull ann the other way but the other one manages to push irving over the railing of the gangway and almost into the water joe and ann run to the other side of the floor where the dancers have dispersed and are watching the action 
 joe sees more secret service coming from the other side so he runs back the other way cornered he confronts them as they close ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and the crowd cheers irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men having his beard pulled but responds to this with an angry punch to the face mario runs over his hair with his comb muttering some italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to help joe the conductor of the band motions to the musicians to start playing and they respond with an energetic tune the scene of chaos continues joe and irving and mario laying into the secret service men distracted two of the men manage to grab ann and drag her away joe runs after irving following with his camera 
 joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds with a punch freeing ann ann looks around her for a way to help picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at man joe keeps fighting with the man as ann picks up a guitar lying near the band and stands behind him on a chair one of the men starts towards her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head then swings it down hitting him full on the head stunning him for a moment 
 
 irving 
 excitedly trying to get his camera ready having missed the shot the first time 
 hit him again smithy 
 the drummer rolls again as ann swings the guitar back then releasing it and smashing it over the camera flashing as she does so 
 police sirens sound and the polizia arrive packed into their cars as they spill out joe ann and irving start to leave the scene leaving the secret service men staggering or lying about the dance floor dazed 
 
 irving 
 joe give me my car keys 
 
 joe 
 to irving he stops pointing at the police 
 police police 
 
 irving 
 seeing them arrive in numbers they change their direction 
 the other side of the bridge 
 as joe and ann run across the barges irving tries stalling the men who try to follow with a life belt but they make it past him running to follow ann joe and ann run through a boathouse and on reaching the other end walk along the outside edge just above the water 
 unseen a secret service man covers the outside of the boathouse as they double back joe peers round the corner and the man surprises him with a punch to the face knocking him into the water ann knees him in the groin and pushes him away she holds her nose and dives in after joe just escaping the reach of the man as he tries to stop her the polizia arrest the remaining secret service men and take them away one of them being dragged by a guitar around his neck his head clean through the guitar the band starts up again and people replace the fallen furniture as the crowd waves across the water apparently after joe and ann as they swim away 
 joe and ann stagger out of the water completely wet through joe leads her to a rock where they sit down joe rubbing her around the shoulders as she shivers 
 
 joe 
 alright 
 
 ann

 joe

 she stops suddenly looking into his eyes he leans forward and kisses long steady kiss they look at each other for a moment

 ann takes his hand and they go out on the floor to dance joe watches them dancing for a moment then takes out a notebook quickly writing something down irving arrives at the bottom of the steps saying something in italian and holding up his camera as he walks past he walks towards the barges the secret service man watches ann as she dances with mario 
 
 irving

 joe 
 quietly 
 just in time pal 
 
 irving 
 smithy dancing with 
 
 joe 
 her hair this afternoon made a date for tonight 
 
 irving 
 musing as he watches them 
 the princess and the barber 
 
 mario and ann continue dancing having a great time 
 irving walks around the other side of the bar his camera placed on the table joe hiding it from the view of the floor the barman protests but irving reassures him keeping his eyes on ann irving watches waiting and then with a signal joe jumps away and the bulb flashes as irving takes the picture in an instant joe jumps back nonchalantly looking up at the sky while irving takes his glass doing the same 
 ann looks out across the floor and then seeing joe and irving waves irving lifts his glass in acknowledgement 
 on the bridge up above the dancing several cars pull up several men climb out rushing over to the steps the first secret service man smoking a cigarette watches the men approach the men walk over to the tables 
 ann continues dancing with mario who suddenly stops looking at her hair 
 
 ann 
 what is it 
 
 mario delani 
 moment 
 
 he stops thinking and then taking out a comb brushes her fringe apart which he delicately curls around with his comb into two neat tufts he puts his comb away satisfied ann moves to touch her hair but mario quickly motions her to leave it alone and they continue dancing 
 one of the secret service men stands leaning against a structure swinging his hand to the beat smiling the man watching behind rebukes him with a word and his expression turns serious as he pulls his hat down putting his hands in his pockets looking out again over the dancing 
 the music stops and everyone applauds the musicians 
 
 mario delani 
 thank you 
 
 the first secret service man comes over to ann then mario seeing him says something to ann in italian then bye and leaves her to him 
 ann smiles slightly but nervously to the man and they start to dance they turn several times then the man speaks in her ear 
 
 secret service man 
 your highness 
 
 she looks at up him sharply and tries to pull away but he holds her 
 dance quietly towards the entrance there is a car waiting 
 
 ann 
 desperately trying to pull away 
 no 
 
 secret service man 
 your highness please 
 
 ann 
 as he forces her over to the side 
 you made a mistake 
 
 tells him in italian pretending that she speak english 
 let me go 
 
 loudly 
 will you let me go 
 
 shouting 
 mr bradley 
 
 joe looks up and starts toward her looking for her in the dancers 
 let me go will you mr bradley 
 irving looks around from his drink and seeing the problem rushes after joe two of the secret service men drag ann away from the barges but joe catches them and pushes them away pushing one of them down and taking ann by the arm joe punches one man who tries to pull ann the other way but the other one manages to push irving over the railing of the gangway and almost into the water joe and ann run to the other side of the floor where the dancers have dispersed and are watching the action 
 joe sees more secret service coming from the other side so he runs back the other way cornered he confronts them as they close ann standing to the side as he throws one over the side ann has the presence of mind to throw him a life belt to him and the crowd cheers irving meanwhile struggles with one of the men having his beard pulled but responds to this with an angry punch to the face mario runs over his hair with his comb muttering some italian to the people near him before rushing in to the fray to help joe the conductor of the band motions to the musicians to start playing and they respond with an energetic tune the scene of chaos continues joe and irving and mario laying into the secret service men distracted two of the men manage to grab ann and drag her away joe runs after irving following with his camera 
 joe pushes one of the men to the ground and the other responds with a punch freeing ann ann looks around her for a way to help picking up a bottles and throws it weakly at man joe keeps fighting with the man as ann picks up a guitar lying near the band and stands behind him on a chair one of the men starts towards her and there is drum roll as she lifts the guitar over her head then swings it down hitting him full on the head stunning him for a moment 
 
 irving 
 excitedly trying to get his camera ready having missed the shot the first time 
 hit him again smithy 
 the drummer rolls again as ann swings the guitar back then releasing it and smashing it over the camera flashing as she does so 
 police sirens sound and the polizia arrive packed into their cars as they spill out joe ann and irving start to leave the scene leaving the secret service men staggering or lying about the dance floor dazed 
 
 irving 
 joe give me my car keys 
 
 joe 
 to irving he stops pointing at the police 
 police police 
 
 irving 
 seeing them arrive in numbers they change their direction 
 the other side of the bridge 
 as joe and ann run across the barges irving tries stalling the men who try to follow with a life belt but they make it past him running to follow ann joe and ann run through a boathouse and on reaching the other end walk along the outside edge just above the water 
 unseen a secret service man covers the outside of the boathouse as they double back joe peers round the corner and the man surprises him with a punch to the face knocking him into the water ann knees him in the groin and pushes him away she holds her nose and dives in after joe just escaping the reach of the man as he tries to stop her the polizia arrest the remaining secret service men and take them away one of them being dragged by a guitar around his neck his head clean through the guitar the band starts up again and people replace the fallen furniture as the crowd waves across the water apparently after joe and ann as they swim away 
 joe and ann stagger out of the water completely wet through joe leads her to a rock where they sit down joe rubbing her around the shoulders as she shivers 
 
 joe 
 alright 
 
 ann 
 fine how are you 
 
 joe 
 oh fine 
 
 they laugh out loud for several moments he looks at her 
 say you know you were great back there 
 
 ann 
 you so bad yourself 
 she stops suddenly looking into his eyes he leans forward and kisses long steady kiss they look at each other for a moment 
 
 joe 
 after a pause 
 well i i guess better get car and get out of here 
 they stand up and hurry on their way

 ext chicago matrix day 
 an el train 
 
 int hotel lafayette matrix day 
 the room is empty heavy curtains covering windows it 
 looks as if it been touched in years in the 
 bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black phone 
 begins to ring 
 in the mirror we first glimpse them and as we keep 
 turning the room fills with equipment and the team 
 morpheus answers the phone 
 morpheus 
 in 
 he hangs up 
 morpheus 
 mouse and cable hold the exit 
 go 
 
 int stairwell matrix day 
 neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds 
 around an antique elevator shaft 
 neo 
 did you have to do this 
 trinity 
 yeah 
 neo 
 what did she tell you 
 trinity 
 lots of things 
 neo 
 any of them true 
 trinity looks at him then looks away 
 trinity 
 some of them 
 gizmo 
 were they good or bad 
 trinity 
 no point in worrylng whatever is going to happen is 
 going to happen 
 they cross the old lobby switch and apoc stop at the 
 doors 
 morpheus 
 we should be back in an hour 
 
 ext hotel lafayette matrix day 
 neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright 
 he is the only one without sunglasses 
 morpheus 
 do you now understand what it 
 means when we say if not 
 one of us one of them 
 neo 
 the agents sentient 
 programs they can commandeer any 
 software hardwired to the 
 mainframe 
 morpheus 
 anyone that is still in a power 
 plant that is why we try to be 
 invisible in the matrix 
 neo 
 the best hacking is always traceless 
 cypher and trinity move away from them securing the 
 perimeter as cypher passes a garbage can he 
 surreptitiously drops something inside 
 it is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as 
 the line connects 
 an early s black lincoln continental emerges from a 
 corrugated garage morpheus and neo get in 
 
 int lincoln continental matrix day 
 an enormous man is waiting for them a wad of chewing 
 tobacco bulges his cheek he spits into a coke can 
 mojo 
 morpheus been a long time coming 
 morpheus 
 looking well mojo 
 mojo coughs a brown cankerous laugh juice speckling his 
 chin and shirt he stares at neo 
 mojo 
 you bringing us geriatrics now morpheus 
 he spits and laughs again 
 mojo 
 guess you are locking for a miracle 
 
 ext bar matrix day 
 the continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of 
 neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes 
 
 int bar matrix day 
 a lightless bar no one enters that is not 
 expected 
 the front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as 
 mojo leads morpheus and neo inside neo looks around 
 his eyes adjusting to the darkness 
 mojo talks to the bartender then looks over 
 mojo 
 all right cool go on back 
 they weave their way to the back of the bar the sticky 
 floor snapping under their feet 
 a monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up 
 rex 
 late 
 he moves to the side opening the heavy iron door behind 
 him they descend the basement staircase toward the 
 single bare bulb at the bottom hanging above the only 
 door 
 
 int basement matrix day 
 a laptop and modem are set up on a stack of 
 milk crates neo waits as morpheus types in a series of 
 access codes after a moment the screen blinks welcome 
 morpheus 
 morpheus walks back to the same door they entered but it 
 now leads into 
 
 int temple of zion matrix day 
 the walls and floors are polished marble neo follows 
 his mouth agape 
 neo 
 what what happened 
 morpheus 
 this is the temple it is a part of mainframe hidden 
 inside the matrix so that we can access it 
 two priestesses are waiting in the antechamber 
 priestess 
 hello morpheus been expecting you 
 morpheus 
 okay on your own go with 
 them 
 they take neo by the arm leading him down a hall into 
 another room 
 priestess 
 wait here among the other potentials 
 
 int room of potentials matrix day 
 neo enters and finally understands the attention given to 
 his age the potentials are all little children 
 the room feels at once like a buddhist temple and a 
 kindergarten class the heads are either 
 shaved or thick with dreadlocks some are playing 
 others meditating or practicing their gift 
 neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet 
 blocks a skinny boy holds a spoon which sways like a 
 blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind 
 neo crosses to him sits 
 the boy smiles as neo picks up a spoon and tries to 
 imitate him despite his best efforts neo cannot make 
 it bend 
 spoon boy 
 your spoon does not bend because it is just that a spoon mine 
 bends because there is no spoon just my mind 
 neo watches as it curls into a knot 
 spoon boy

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the very secret diarycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks there was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their christmas holidays because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked so many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that madam pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around bed to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face 
 
 harry and ron went to visit her every evening when the new term started they brought her each homework 
 
 if sprouted whiskers take a break from work said ron tipping a stack of books onto bedside table one evening 
 
 be silly ron got to keep up said hermione briskly her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown i suppose got any new leads she added in a whisper so that madam pomfrey hear her 
 
 nothing said harry gloomily 
 
 i was so sure it was malfoy said ron for about the hundredth time 
 
 that asked harry pointing to something gold sticking out from under pillow 
 
 just a get well card said hermione hastily trying to poke it out of sight but ron was too quick for her he pulled it out flicked it open and read aloud 
 
 to miss granger wishing you a speedy recovery from your concerned teacher professor gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award 
 
 ron looked up at hermione disgusted 
 
 you sleep with this under your pillow 
 
 but hermione was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine 
 
 is lockhart the smarmiest bloke ever met or what ron said to harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward gryffindor tower 
 
 snape had given them so much homework harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hair raising potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears 
 
 filch harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused out of sight listening hard 
 
 you think someone been attacked said ron tensely 
 
 they stood still their heads inclined toward voice which sounded quite hysterical 
 
 even more work for me mopping all night like i got enough to do no this is the final straw going to dumbledore 
 
 his footsteps receded along the corridor and they heard a distant door slam 
 
 they poked their heads around the corner filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spot where mrs norris had been attacked they saw at a glance what filch had been shouting about a great flood of water stretched over half the corridor and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of moaning bathroom now that filch had stopped shouting they could hear wails echoing off the bathroom walls 
 
 now up with her said ron 
 
 go and see said harry and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign ignored it as always and entered 
 
 moaning myrtle was crying if possible louder and harder than ever before she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet 
 
 up myrtle said harry 
 
 that glugged myrtle miserably come to throw something else at me 
 
 harry waded across to her stall and said why would i throw something at you 
 
 ask me myrtle shouted emerging with a wave of yet more water which splashed onto the already sopping floor here i am minding my own business and someone thinks funny to throw a book at me 
 
 but it hurt you if someone throws something at you said harry reasonably i mean just go right through you it 
 
 he had said the wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked all throw books at myrtle because she feel it ten points if you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes through her head well ha ha ha what a lovely game i think 
 
 who threw it at you anyway asked harry 
 
 i know i was just sitting in the thinking about death and it fell right through the top of my head said myrtle glaring at them over there it got washed out 
 
 harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing a small thin book lay there it had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom harry stepped forward to pick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back 
 
 what said harry 
 
 are you crazy said ron it could be dangerous 
 
 harry laughing come off it how could it be dangerous 
 
 be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively at the book some of the books the confiscated told me there was one that burned your eyes out and everyone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives and some old witch in bath had a book that you could never stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in it trying to do everything and 
 
 all right got the point said harry 
 
 the little book lay on the floor nondescript and soggy 
 
 well we find out unless we look at it he said and he ducked around ron and picked it up off the floor 
 
 harry saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on the first page he could just make out the name t m riddle in smudged ink 
 
 hang on said ron who had approached cautiously and was looking over shoulder i know that name t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago 
 
 how on earth know that said harry in amazement 
 
 because filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention said ron resentfully that was the one i burped slugs all over if wiped slime off a name for an hour remember it too 
 
 harry peeled the wet pages apart they were completely blank there the faintest trace of writing on any of them not even auntie birthday or dentist three 
 
 he never wrote in it said harry disappointed 
 
 i wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiously 
 
 harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on vauxhall road london 
 
 he been said harry thoughtfully to have bought a diary from vauxhall road 
 
 well not much use to you said ron he dropped his voice fifty points if you can get it through nose 
 
 harry however pocketed it 
 
 hermione left the hospital wing and furfree at the beginning of february on her first evening back in gryffindor tower harry showed her t m diary and told her the story of how they had found it 
 
 oooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiastically taking the diary and looking at it closely 
 
 if it has hiding them very well said ron maybe shy i know why you chuck it harry 
 
 i wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it said harry i mind knowing how riddle got an award for special services to hogwarts either 
 
 been anything said ron maybe he got thirty or saved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle that done everyone a favor 
 
 but harry could tell from the arrested look on face that she was thinking what he was thinking 
 
 what said ron looking from one to the other 
 
 well the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago it he said what malfoy said 
 
 yeah said ron slowly 
 
 and this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedly 
 
 so 
 
 oh ron wake up snapped hermione we know the person who opened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we know t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago well what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir of slytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where the chamber is and how to open it and what sort of creature lives in it the person behind the attacks this time want that lying around would they 
 
 a brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny little flaw nothing written in his diary 
 
 but hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag 
 
 it might be invisible ink she whispered 
 
 she tapped the diary three times and said aparecium 
 
 nothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser 
 
 a revealer i got it in diagon alley she said 
 
 she rubbed hard on january first nothing happened 
 
 telling you nothing to find in there said ron riddle just got a diary for christmas and be bothered filling it in 
 
 harry explain even to himself why he just throw diary away the fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages as though it were a story he wanted to finish and while harry was sure he had never heard the name t m riddle before it still seemed to mean something to him almost as though riddle was a friend had when he was very small and had but this was absurd never had friends before hogwarts dudley had made sure of that 
 
 nevertheless harry was determined to find out more about riddle so next day at break he headed for the trophy room to examine special award accompanied by an interested hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced ron who told them seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime 
 
 burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet it carry details of why it had been given to him good thing too or be even bigger and still be polishing it said ron however they did find name on an old medal for magical merit and on a list of old head boys 
 
 he sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose in disgust prefect head boy probably top of every class 
 
 you say that like a bad thing said hermione in a slightly hurt voice 
 
 the sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again inside the castle the mood had grown more hopeful there had been no more attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick and madam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive meaning that they were fast leaving childhood 
 
 the moment their acne clears up be ready for repotting again harry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon and after that it be long until cutting them up and stewing them have mrs norris back in no time 
 
 perhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harry it must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secrets with the school so alert and suspicious perhaps the monster whatever it was was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years 
 
 ernie macmillan of hufflepuff take this cheerful view he was still convinced that harry was the guilty one that he had given himself away at the dueling club peeves helping matters he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh potter you rotter now with a dance routine to match 
 
 gilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while the gryffindors were lining up for transfiguration i think be any more trouble minerva he said tapping his nose knowingly and winking i think the chamber has been locked for good this time the culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before i caught him rather sensible to stop now before i came down hard on him 
 
 you know what the school needs now is a wash away the memories of last term i say any more just now but i think i know just the thing 
 
 he tapped his nose again and strode off 
 
 idea of a became clear at breakfast time on february fourteenth harry had much sleep because of a quidditch practice the night before and he hurried down to the great hall slightly late he thought for a moment that walked through the wrong doors 
 
 the walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worse still confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling harry went over to the gryffindor table where ron was sitting looking sickened and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles 
 
 going on harry asked them sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon 
 
 ron pointed to the apparently too disgusted to speak lockhart wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations was waving for silence the teachers on either side of him were looking from where he sat harry could see a muscle going in professor cheek snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of 
 
 happy day lockhart shouted and may i thank the people who have so far sent me cards yes i have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all and it end here 
 
 lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen dwarfs not just any dwarfs however lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps 
 
 my friendly cupids beamed lockhart they will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fun stop here sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you how to whip up a love potion and while at it professor flitwick knows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard ever met the sly old dog 
 
 professor flitwick buried his face in his hands snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would be poison 
 
 please hermione tell me you one of the said ron as they left the great hall for their first lesson hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and answer 
 
 all day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon as the gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfs caught up with harry 
 
 oy you arry potter shouted a particularly dwarf elbowing people out of the way to get to harry 
 
 hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years which happened to include ginny weasley harry tried to escape the dwarf however cut his way through the crowd by kicking shins and reached him before gone two paces 
 
 got a musical message to deliver to arry potter in person he said twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way 
 
 not here harry hissed trying to escape 
 
 stay still grunted the dwarf grabbing hold of bag and pulling him back 
 
 let me go harry snarled tugging 
 
 with a loud ripping noise his bag split in two his books wand parchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything 
 
 harry scrambled around trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing causing something of a holdup in the corridor 
 
 going on here came the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musical valentine 
 
 all this commotion said another familiar voice as percy weasley arrived 
 
 losing his head harry tried to make a run for it but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor 
 
 right he said sitting on ankles here is your singing valentine 
 
 his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad 
 
 his hair is as dark as a blackboard 
 
 i wish he was mine 
 
 really divine 
 
 the hero who conquered the dark lord 
 
 harry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on the spot trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else he got up his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf as percy weasley did his best to disperse the crowd some of whom were crying with mirth 
 
 off you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to class now he said shooing some of the younger students away and you malfoy 
 
 harry glancing over saw malfoy stoop and snatch up something leering he showed it to crabbe and goyle and harry realized that got diary 
 
 give that back said harry quietly 
 
 wonder what written in this said malfoy who obviously noticed the year on the cover and thought he had own diary a hush fell over the onlookers ginny was staring from the diary to harry looking terrified 
 
 hand it over malfoy said percy sternly 
 
 when had a look said malfoy waving the diary tauntingly at harry 
 
 percy said as a school prefect but harry had lost his temper he pulled out his wand and shouted expelliarmus and just as snape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air ron grinning broadly caught it 
 
 harry said percy loudly no magic in the corridors have to report this you know 
 
 but harry care he was on malfoy and that was worth five points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious and as ginny passed him to enter her classroom he yelled spitefully after her i think potter liked your valentine much 
 
 ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class snarling ron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron need to spend the whole of charms belching slugs 
 
 it until they had reached professor class that harry noticed something rather odd about diary all his other books were drenched in scarlet ink the diary however was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it he tried to point this out to ron but ron was having trouble with his wand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end and he much interested in anything else 
 
 harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night this was partly because he think he could stand fred and george singing his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time and partly because he wanted to examine diary again and knew that ron thought he was wasting his time 
 
 harry sat on his and flicked through the blank pages not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary 
 
 the ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then as though it was being sucked into the page vanished excited harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote my name is harry potter 
 
 the words shone momentarily on the page and they too sank without trace then at last something happened 
 
 oozing back out of the page in his very own ink came words harry had never written 
 
 hello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by my diary 
 
 these words too faded away but not before harry had started to scribble back 
 
 someone tried to flush it down a toilet 
 
 he waited eagerly for reply 
 
 lucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink but i always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read 
 
 what do you mean harry scrawled blotting the page in his excitement 
 
 i mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things things that were covered up things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 where i am now harry wrote quickly at hogwarts and horrible been happening do you know anything about the chamber of secrets 
 
 his heart was hammering reply came quickly his writing becoming untidier as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew 
 
 of course i know about the chamber of secrets in my day they told us it was a legend that it did not exist but this was a lie in my fifth year the chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students finally killing one i caught the person opened the chamber and he was expelled but the headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such a thing had happened at hogwarts forbade me to tell the truth a story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident they gave me a nice shiny engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut but i knew it could happen again the monster lived on and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned 
 
 harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back 
 
 happening again now there have been three attacks and no one seems to know behind them who was it last time 
 
 i can show you if you like came reply you have to take my word for it i can take you inside my memory of the night when i caught him 
 
 harry hesitated his quill suspended over the diary what did riddle mean how could he be taken inside somebody memory he glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory which was growing dark when he looked back at the diary he saw fresh words forming 
 
 let me show you 
 
 harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters 
 
 ok 
 
 the pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind stopping halfway through the month of june mouth hanging open harry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightly he raised the book to press his eye against the little window and before he knew what was happening he was tilting forward the window was widening he felt his body leave his bed and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page into a whirl of color and shadow 
 
 he felt his feet hit solid ground and stood shaking as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus 
 
 he knew immediately where he was this circular room with the sleeping portraits was office but it dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk a wizened wizard bald except for a few wisps of white hair was reading a letter by candlelight harry had never seen this man before 
 
 sorry he said shakily i mean to butt in 
 
 but the wizard look up he continued to read frowning slightly harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered er just go shall i 
 
 still the wizard ignored him he seem even to have heard him thinking that the wizard might be deaf harry raised his voice 
 
 sorry i disturbed you go now he 
 
 the wizard folded up the letter with a sigh stood up walked past harry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains at his window 
 
 the sky outside the window was it seemed to be sunset the wizard went back to the desk sat down and twiddled his thumbs watching the door 
 
 harry looked around the office no fawkes the phoenix no whirring silver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known it meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledore and he harry was little more than a phantom completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago 
 
 there was a knock on the office door 
 
 enter said the old wizard in a feeble voice 
 
 a boy of about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat a silver badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller than harry but he too had hair 
 
 ah riddle said the headmaster 
 
 you wanted to see me professor dippet said riddle he looked nervous 
 
 sit down said dippet just been reading the letter you sent me 
 
 oh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together very tightly 
 
 my dear boy said dipper kindly i cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer surely you want to go home for the holidays 
 
 no said riddle at once much rather stay at hogwarts than go back to that to that 
 
 you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays i believe said dippet curiously 
 
 yes sir said riddle reddening slightly 
 
 you are 
 
 sir said riddle muggle father witch mother 
 
 and are both your parents 
 
 my mother died just after i was born sir they told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me tom after my father marvolo after my grandfather 
 
 dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically 
 
 the thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might have been made for you but in the current circumstances 
 
 you mean all these attacks sir said riddle and heart leapt and he moved closer scared of missing anything 
 
 precisely said the headmaster my dear boy you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death of that poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage as a matter of fact the ministry of magic is even now talking about closing the school we are no nearer locating the er source of all this unpleasantness 
 
 eyes had widened 
 
 sir if the person was caught if it all stopped 
 
 what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice sitting up in his chair riddle do you mean you know something about these attacks 
 
 no sir said riddle quickly 
 
 but harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given dumbledore 
 
 dippet sank back looking faintly disappointed 
 
 you may go tom 
 
 riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room harry followed him 
 
 down the moving spiral staircase they went emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor riddle stopped and so did harry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing some serious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowed 
 
 then as though he had suddenly reached a decision he hurried off harry gliding noiselessly behind him they see another person until they reached the entrance hall when a tall wizard with long sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marble staircase 
 
 what are you doing wandering around this late tom 
 
 harry gaped at the wizard he was none other than a dumbledore 
 
 i had to see the headmaster sir said riddle 
 
 well hurry off to bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare harry knew so well best not to roam the corridors these days not since 
 
 he sighed heavily bade riddle good night and strode off riddle watched him walk out of sight and then moving quickly headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons with harry in hot pursuit 
 
 but to disappointment riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which harry had potions with snape the torches been lit and when riddle pushed the door almost closed harry could only just see him standing by the door watching the passage outside 
 
 it felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour all he could see was the figure of riddle at the door staring through the crack waiting like a statue and just when harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present he heard something move beyond the door 
 
 someone was creeping along the passage he heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden riddle quiet as a shadow edged through the door and followed harry tiptoeing behind him forgetting that he be heard 
 
 for perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps until riddle stopped suddenly his head inclined in the direction of new noises harry heard a door creak open and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper 
 
 gotta get yeh outta here now in the box 
 
 there was something familiar about that voice 
 
 riddle suddenly jumped around the corner harry stepped out behind him he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door a very large box next to it 
 
 evening rubeus said riddle sharply 
 
 the boy slammed the door shut and stood up 
 
 what yer here tom 
 
 riddle stepped closer 
 
 all over he said going to have to turn you in rubeus talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks stop 
 
 n at 
 
 i think you meant to kill anyone but monsters make good pets i suppose you just let it out for exercise and 
 
 it never killed no one said the large boy backing against the closed door from behind him harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking 
 
 come on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer the dead parents will be here tomorrow the least hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered 
 
 it him roared the boy his voice echoing in the dark passage he wouldn he never 
 
 stand aside said riddle drawing out his wand 
 
 his spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light the door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite and out of it came something that made harry let out a long piercing scream unheard by anyone 
 
 a vast hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam of many eyes and a pair of pincers riddle raised his wand again but he was too late the thing bowled him over as it scuttled away tearing up the corridor and out of sight riddle scrambled to his feet looking after it he raised his wand but the huge boy leapt on him seized his wand and threw him back down yelling noooooo 
 
 the scene whirled the darkness became complete harry felt himself falling and with a crash he landed on his in the gryffindor dormitory diary lying open on his stomach 
 
 before he had had time to regain his breath the dormitory door opened and ron came in 
 
 there you are he said 
 
 harry sat up he was sweating and shaking 
 
 up said ron looking at him with concern 
 
 it was hagrid ron hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fifty years ago 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the very secret diarycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks there was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their christmas holidays because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked so many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that madam pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around bed to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face 
 
 harry and ron went to visit her every evening when the new term started they brought her each homework 
 
 if sprouted whiskers take a break from work said ron tipping a stack of books onto bedside table one evening 
 
 be silly ron got to keep up said hermione briskly her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown i suppose got any new leads she added in a whisper so that madam pomfrey hear her 
 
 nothing said harry gloomily 
 
 i was so sure it was malfoy said ron for about the hundredth time 
 
 that asked harry pointing to something gold sticking out from under pillow 
 
 just a get well card said hermione hastily trying to poke it out of sight but ron was too quick for her he pulled it out flicked it open and read aloud 
 
 to miss granger wishing you a speedy recovery from your concerned teacher professor gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award 
 
 ron looked up at hermione disgusted 
 
 you sleep with this under your pillow 
 
 but hermione was spared answering by madam pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine 
 
 is lockhart the smarmiest bloke ever met or what ron said to harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward gryffindor tower 
 
 snape had given them so much homework harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hair raising potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears 
 
 filch harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused out of sight listening hard 
 
 you think someone been attacked said ron tensely 
 
 they stood still their heads inclined toward voice which sounded quite hysterical 
 
 even more work for me mopping all night like i got enough to do no this is the final straw going to dumbledore 
 
 his footsteps receded along the corridor and they heard a distant door slam 
 
 they poked their heads around the corner filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spot where mrs norris had been attacked they saw at a glance what filch had been shouting about a great flood of water stretched over half the corridor and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of moaning bathroom now that filch had stopped shouting they could hear wails echoing off the bathroom walls 
 
 now up with her said ron 
 
 go and see said harry and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its out of order sign ignored it as always and entered 
 
 moaning myrtle was crying if possible louder and harder than ever before she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet 
 
 up myrtle said harry 
 
 that glugged myrtle miserably come to throw something else at me 
 
 harry waded across to her stall and said why would i throw something at you 
 
 ask me myrtle shouted emerging with a wave of yet more water which splashed onto the already sopping floor here i am minding my own business and someone thinks funny to throw a book at me 
 
 but it hurt you if someone throws something at you said harry reasonably i mean just go right through you it 
 
 he had said the wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked all throw books at myrtle because she feel it ten points if you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes through her head well ha ha ha what a lovely game i think 
 
 who threw it at you anyway asked harry 
 
 i know i was just sitting in the thinking about death and it fell right through the top of my head said myrtle glaring at them over there it got washed out 
 
 harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing a small thin book lay there it had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom harry stepped forward to pick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back 
 
 what said harry 
 
 are you crazy said ron it could be dangerous 
 
 harry laughing come off it how could it be dangerous 
 
 be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively at the book some of the books the confiscated told me there was one that burned your eyes out and everyone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives and some old witch in bath had a book that you could never stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in it trying to do everything and 
 
 all right got the point said harry 
 
 the little book lay on the floor nondescript and soggy 
 
 well we find out unless we look at it he said and he ducked around ron and picked it up off the floor 
 
 harry saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on the first page he could just make out the name t m riddle in smudged ink 
 
 hang on said ron who had approached cautiously and was looking over shoulder i know that name t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago 
 
 how on earth know that said harry in amazement 
 
 because filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention said ron resentfully that was the one i burped slugs all over if wiped slime off a name for an hour remember it too 
 
 harry peeled the wet pages apart they were completely blank there the faintest trace of writing on any of them not even auntie birthday or dentist three 
 
 he never wrote in it said harry disappointed 
 
 i wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiously 
 
 harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on vauxhall road london 
 
 he been said harry thoughtfully to have bought a diary from vauxhall road 
 
 well not much use to you said ron he dropped his voice fifty points if you can get it through nose 
 
 harry however pocketed it 
 
 hermione left the hospital wing and furfree at the beginning of february on her first evening back in gryffindor tower harry showed her t m diary and told her the story of how they had found it 
 
 oooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiastically taking the diary and looking at it closely 
 
 if it has hiding them very well said ron maybe shy i know why you chuck it harry 
 
 i wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it said harry i mind knowing how riddle got an award for special services to hogwarts either 
 
 been anything said ron maybe he got thirty or saved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle that done everyone a favor 
 
 but harry could tell from the arrested look on face that she was thinking what he was thinking 
 
 what said ron looking from one to the other 
 
 well the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago it he said what malfoy said 
 
 yeah said ron slowly 
 
 and this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedly 
 
 so 
 
 oh ron wake up snapped hermione we know the person who opened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we know t m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago well what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir of slytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where the chamber is and how to open it and what sort of creature lives in it the person behind the attacks this time want that lying around would they 
 
 a brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny little flaw nothing written in his diary 
 
 but hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag 
 
 it might be invisible ink she whispered 
 
 she tapped the diary three times and said aparecium 
 
 nothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser 
 
 a revealer i got it in diagon alley she said 
 
 she rubbed hard on january first nothing happened 
 
 telling you nothing to find in there said ron riddle just got a diary for christmas and be bothered filling it in 
 
 harry explain even to himself why he just throw diary away the fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages as though it were a story he wanted to finish and while harry was sure he had never heard the name t m riddle before it still seemed to mean something to him almost as though riddle was a friend had when he was very small and had but this was absurd never had friends before hogwarts dudley had made sure of that 
 
 nevertheless harry was determined to find out more about riddle so next day at break he headed for the trophy room to examine special award accompanied by an interested hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced ron who told them seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime 
 
 burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet it carry details of why it had been given to him good thing too or be even bigger and still be polishing it said ron however they did find name on an old medal for magical merit and on a list of old head boys 
 
 he sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose in disgust prefect head boy probably top of every class 
 
 you say that like a bad thing said hermione in a slightly hurt voice 
 
 the sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again inside the castle the mood had grown more hopeful there had been no more attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick and madam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive meaning that they were fast leaving childhood 
 
 the moment their acne clears up be ready for repotting again harry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon and after that it be long until cutting them up and stewing them have mrs norris back in no time 
 
 perhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harry it must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secrets with the school so alert and suspicious perhaps the monster whatever it was was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years 
 
 ernie macmillan of hufflepuff take this cheerful view he was still convinced that harry was the guilty one that he had given himself away at the dueling club peeves helping matters he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh potter you rotter now with a dance routine to match 
 
 gilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while the gryffindors were lining up for transfiguration i think be any more trouble minerva he said tapping his nose knowingly and winking i think the chamber has been locked for good this time the culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before i caught him rather sensible to stop now before i came down hard on him 
 
 you know what the school needs now is a wash away the memories of last term i say any more just now but i think i know just the thing 
 
 he tapped his nose again and strode off 
 
 idea of a became clear at breakfast time on february fourteenth harry had much sleep because of a quidditch practice the night before and he hurried down to the great hall slightly late he thought for a moment that walked through the wrong doors 
 
 the walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worse still confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling harry went over to the gryffindor table where ron was sitting looking sickened and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles 
 
 going on harry asked them sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon 
 
 ron pointed to the apparently too disgusted to speak lockhart wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations was waving for silence the teachers on either side of him were looking from where he sat harry could see a muscle going in professor cheek snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of 
 
 happy day lockhart shouted and may i thank the people who have so far sent me cards yes i have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all and it end here 
 
 lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen dwarfs not just any dwarfs however lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps 
 
 my friendly cupids beamed lockhart they will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fun stop here sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you how to whip up a love potion and while at it professor flitwick knows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard ever met the sly old dog 
 
 professor flitwick buried his face in his hands snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would be poison 
 
 please hermione tell me you one of the said ron as they left the great hall for their first lesson hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and answer 
 
 all day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon as the gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfs caught up with harry 
 
 oy you arry potter shouted a particularly dwarf elbowing people out of the way to get to harry 
 
 hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years which happened to include ginny weasley harry tried to escape the dwarf however cut his way through the crowd by kicking shins and reached him before gone two paces 
 
 got a musical message to deliver to arry potter in person he said twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way 
 
 not here harry hissed trying to escape 
 
 stay still grunted the dwarf grabbing hold of bag and pulling him back 
 
 let me go harry snarled tugging 
 
 with a loud ripping noise his bag split in two his books wand parchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything 
 
 harry scrambled around trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing causing something of a holdup in the corridor 
 
 going on here came the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musical valentine 
 
 all this commotion said another familiar voice as percy weasley arrived 
 
 losing his head harry tried to make a run for it but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor 
 
 right he said sitting on ankles here is your singing valentine 
 
 his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad 
 
 his hair is as dark as a blackboard 
 
 i wish he was mine 
 
 really divine 
 
 the hero who conquered the dark lord 
 
 harry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on the spot trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else he got up his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf as percy weasley did his best to disperse the crowd some of whom were crying with mirth 
 
 off you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to class now he said shooing some of the younger students away and you malfoy 
 
 harry glancing over saw malfoy stoop and snatch up something leering he showed it to crabbe and goyle and harry realized that got diary 
 
 give that back said harry quietly 
 
 wonder what written in this said malfoy who obviously noticed the year on the cover and thought he had own diary a hush fell over the onlookers ginny was staring from the diary to harry looking terrified 
 
 hand it over malfoy said percy sternly 
 
 when had a look said malfoy waving the diary tauntingly at harry 
 
 percy said as a school prefect but harry had lost his temper he pulled out his wand and shouted expelliarmus and just as snape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air ron grinning broadly caught it 
 
 harry said percy loudly no magic in the corridors have to report this you know 
 
 but harry care he was on malfoy and that was worth five points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious and as ginny passed him to enter her classroom he yelled spitefully after her i think potter liked your valentine much 
 
 ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class snarling ron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron need to spend the whole of charms belching slugs 
 
 it until they had reached professor class that harry noticed something rather odd about diary all his other books were drenched in scarlet ink the diary however was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it he tried to point this out to ron but ron was having trouble with his wand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end and he much interested in anything else 
 
 harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night this was partly because he think he could stand fred and george singing his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more time and partly because he wanted to examine diary again and knew that ron thought he was wasting his time 
 
 harry sat on his and flicked through the blank pages not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary 
 
 the ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then as though it was being sucked into the page vanished excited harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote my name is harry potter 
 
 the words shone momentarily on the page and they too sank without trace then at last something happened 
 
 oozing back out of the page in his very own ink came words harry had never written 
 
 hello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by my diary 
 
 these words too faded away but not before harry had started to scribble back 
 
 someone tried to flush it down a toilet 
 
 he waited eagerly for reply 
 
 lucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink but i always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read 
 
 what do you mean harry scrawled blotting the page in his excitement 
 
 i mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things things that were covered up things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 where i am now harry wrote quickly at hogwarts and horrible been happening do you know anything about the chamber of secrets 
 
 his heart was hammering reply came quickly his writing becoming untidier as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew 
 
 of course i know about the chamber of secrets in my day they told us it was a legend that it did not exist but this was a lie in my fifth year the chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students finally killing one i caught the person opened the chamber and he was expelled but the headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such a thing had happened at hogwarts forbade me to tell the truth a story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident they gave me a nice shiny engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut but i knew it could happen again the monster lived on and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned 
 
 harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back 
 
 happening again now there have been three attacks and no one seems to know behind them who was it last time 
 
 i can show you if you like came reply you have to take my word for it i can take you inside my memory of the night when i caught him 
 
 harry hesitated his quill suspended over the diary what did riddle mean how could he be taken inside somebody memory he glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory which was growing dark when he looked back at the diary he saw fresh words forming 
 
 let me show you 
 
 harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters 
 
 ok 
 
 the pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind stopping halfway through the month of june mouth hanging open harry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightly he raised the book to press his eye against the little window and before he knew what was happening he was tilting forward the window was widening he felt his body leave his bed and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page into a whirl of color and shadow 
 
 he felt his feet hit solid ground and stood shaking as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus 
 
 he knew immediately where he was this circular room with the sleeping portraits was office but it dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk a wizened wizard bald except for a few wisps of white hair was reading a letter by candlelight harry had never seen this man before 
 
 sorry he said shakily i mean to butt in 
 
 but the wizard look up he continued to read frowning slightly harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered er just go shall i 
 
 still the wizard ignored him he seem even to have heard him thinking that the wizard might be deaf harry raised his voice 
 
 sorry i disturbed you go now he 
 
 the wizard folded up the letter with a sigh stood up walked past harry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains at his window 
 
 the sky outside the window was it seemed to be sunset the wizard went back to the desk sat down and twiddled his thumbs watching the door 
 
 harry looked around the office no fawkes the phoenix no whirring silver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known it meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledore and he harry was little more than a phantom completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago 
 
 there was a knock on the office door 
 
 enter said the old wizard in a feeble voice 
 
 a boy of about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat a silver badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller than harry but he too had hair 
 
 ah riddle said the headmaster 
 
 you wanted to see me professor dippet said riddle he looked nervous 
 
 sit down said dippet just been reading the letter you sent me 
 
 oh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together very tightly 
 
 my dear boy said dipper kindly i cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer surely you want to go home for the holidays 
 
 no said riddle at once much rather stay at hogwarts than go back to that to that 
 
 you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays i believe said dippet curiously 
 
 yes sir said riddle reddening slightly 
 
 you are 
 
 sir said riddle muggle father witch mother 
 
 and are both your parents 
 
 my mother died just after i was born sir they told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me tom after my father marvolo after my grandfather 
 
 dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically 
 
 the thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might have been made for you but in the current circumstances 
 
 you mean all these attacks sir said riddle and heart leapt and he moved closer scared of missing anything 
 
 precisely said the headmaster my dear boy you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death of that poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage as a matter of fact the ministry of magic is even now talking about closing the school we are no nearer locating the er source of all this unpleasantness 
 
 eyes had widened 
 
 sir if the person was caught if it all stopped 
 
 what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice sitting up in his chair riddle do you mean you know something about these attacks 
 
 no sir said riddle quickly 
 
 but harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself had given dumbledore 
 
 dippet sank back looking faintly disappointed 
 
 you may go tom 
 
 riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room harry followed him 
 
 down the moving spiral staircase they went emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor riddle stopped and so did harry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing some serious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowed 
 
 then as though he had suddenly reached a decision he hurried off harry gliding noiselessly behind him they see another person until they reached the entrance hall when a tall wizard with long sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marble staircase 
 
 what are you doing wandering around this late tom 
 
 harry gaped at the wizard he was none other than a dumbledore 
 
 i had to see the headmaster sir said riddle 
 
 well hurry off to bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare harry knew so well best not to roam the corridors these days not since 
 
 he sighed heavily bade riddle good night and strode off riddle watched him walk out of sight and then moving quickly headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons with harry in hot pursuit 
 
 but to disappointment riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which harry had potions with snape the torches been lit and when riddle pushed the door almost closed harry could only just see him standing by the door watching the passage outside 
 
 it felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour all he could see was the figure of riddle at the door staring through the crack waiting like a statue and just when harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present he heard something move beyond the door 
 
 someone was creeping along the passage he heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden riddle quiet as a shadow edged through the door and followed harry tiptoeing behind him forgetting that he be heard 
 
 for perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps until riddle stopped suddenly his head inclined in the direction of new noises harry heard a door creak open and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper 
 
 gotta get yeh outta here now in the box 
 
 there was something familiar about that voice 
 
 riddle suddenly jumped around the corner harry stepped out behind him he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door a very large box next to it 
 
 evening rubeus said riddle sharply 
 
 the boy slammed the door shut and stood up 
 
 what yer here tom 
 
 riddle stepped closer 
 
 all over he said going to have to turn you in rubeus talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks stop 
 
 n at 
 
 i think you meant to kill anyone but monsters make good pets i suppose you just let it out for exercise and 
 
 it never killed no one said the large boy backing against the closed door from behind him harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking 
 
 come on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer the dead parents will be here tomorrow the least hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered 
 
 it him roared the boy his voice echoing in the dark passage he wouldn he never 
 
 stand aside said riddle drawing out his wand 
 
 his spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light the door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite and out of it came something that made harry let out a long piercing scream unheard by anyone 
 
 a vast hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam of many eyes and a pair of pincers riddle raised his wand again but he was too late the thing bowled him over as it scuttled away tearing up the corridor and out of sight riddle scrambled to his feet looking after it he raised his wand but the huge boy leapt on him seized his wand and threw him back down yelling noooooo 
 
 the scene whirled the darkness became complete harry felt himself falling and with a crash he landed on his in the gryffindor dormitory diary lying open on his stomach 
 
 before he had had time to regain his breath the dormitory door opened and ron came in 
 
 there you are he said 
 
 harry sat up he was sweating and shaking 
 
 up said ron looking at him with concern 
 
 it was hagrid ron hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fifty years ago

 it looked like the end of ron and friendship each was so angry with the other that harry see how ever make up 
 
 ron was enraged that hermione had never taken attempts to eat scabbers seriously bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys beds hermione meanwhile maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on head in the magical menagerie 
 
 personally harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way she lost her temper with harry too 
 
 okay side with ron i knew you would she said shrilly first the firebolt now scabbers my fault it just leave me alone harry got a lot of work to do 
 
 ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed 
 
 come on ron you were always saying how boring scabbers was said fred bracingly and been for ages he was wasting away it was probably better for him to snuff it quickly one swallow he probably feel a thing 
 
 fred said ginny indignantly 
 
 all he did was eat and sleep ron you said it yourself said george 
 
 he bit goyle for us once ron said miserably remember harry 
 
 yeah true said harry 
 
 his finest hour said fred unable to keep a straight face let the scar on finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory oh come on ron get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat the point of moaning 
 
 in a attempt to cheer ron up harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor final practice before the ravenclaw match so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after finished this did seem to take mind off scabbers for a moment great can i try and shoot a few goals on it so they set off for the quidditch field together 
 
 madam hooch who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion 
 
 look at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault a slight list to the tail end you often find they develop a drag after a few years updated the handle too a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps reminds me of the old silver arrows a pity stopped making them i learned to fly on one and a very fine old broom it was too 
 
 she continued in this vein for some time until wood said er madam hooch is it okay if harry has the firebolt back we need to practice 
 
 oh right here you are then potter said madam hooch sit over here with weasley 
 
 she and ron left the field to sit in the stadium and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for match 
 
 harry just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker cho chang a fourth year and pretty goodi really hoped she be fit had some problems with injuries wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery then said on the other hand she rides a comet two sixty which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt he gave broom a look of fervent admiration then said okay everyone go 
 
 and at long last harry mounted his firebolt and kicked off from the ground 
 
 it was better than ever dreamed the firebolt turned with the lightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a blur harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air again 
 
 harry letting the snitch out wood called 
 
 harry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts he outstripped it easily saw the snitch dart out from behind wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand 
 
 the team cheered madly harry let the snitch go again gave it a head start then tore after it weaving in and out of the others he spotted it lurking near katie knee looped her easily and caught it again 
 
 it was the best practice ever the team inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst performed their best moves faultlessly and by the time they hit the ground again wood have a single criticism to make which as george weasley pointed out was a first 
 
 i see going to stop us tomorrow said wood not unless harry sorted out your dementor problem you 
 
 yeah said harry thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were stronger 
 
 the dementors turn up again oliver go ballistic said fred confidently 
 
 well hope not said wood anyway good work everyone get back to the towerturn in early 
 
 staying out for a bit ron wants a go on the firebolt harry told wood and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms harry strode over to ron who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat 
 
 here you go said harry handing ron the firebolt 
 
 ron an expression of ecstasy on his face mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field watching him night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start told harry and ron off for not waking her and insisted that they go back to the castle 
 
 harry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowy stadium discussing the superbly smooth action its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning they were halfway toward the castle when harry glancing to his left saw something that made his heart turn over a pair of eyes gleaming out of the darkness 
 
 harry stopped dead his heart banging against his ribs 
 
 the matter said ron 
 
 harry pointed ron pulled out his wand and muttered lumos 
 
 a beam of light fell across the grass hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches there crouching among the budding leaves was crookshanks 
 
 get out of here ron roared and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass but before he could do anything else crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail 
 
 see ron said furiously chucking the stone down again still letting him wander about wherever he wants probably washing down scabbers with a couple of birds now 
 
 harry say anything he took a deep breath as relief seeped through him he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the grim they set off for the castle once more slightly ashamed of his moment of panic harry say anything to ron nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hall 
 
 
 
 harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor as harry entered the great hall heads turned in the direction of the firebolt and there was a good deal of excited muttering harry saw with enormous satisfaction that the slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck 
 
 did you see his face said ron gleefully looking back at malfoy he believe it this is brilliant 
 
 wood too was basking in the reflected glory of the firebolt 
 
 put it here harry he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward people from the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look cedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his nimbus and ravenclaw girlfriend penelope clearwater asked if she could actually hold the firebolt 
 
 now now penny no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined the firebolt closely penelope and i have got a bet on he told the team ten galleons on the outcome of the match 
 
 penelope put the firebolt down again thanked harry and went back to her table 
 
 harry make sure you win said percy in an urgent whisper i got ten galleons yes coming penny and he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast 
 
 sure you can manage that broom potter said a cold drawling voice 
 
 draco malfoy had arrived for a closer look crabbe and goyle right behind him 
 
 yeah reckon so said harry casually 
 
 got plenty of special features it said malfoy eyes glittering maliciously shame it come with a parachute in case you get too near a dementor 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 pity you attach an extra arm to yours malfoy said harry then it could catch the snitch for you 
 
 the gryffindor team laughed loudly pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin team who put their heads together no doubt asking malfoy whether broom really was a firebolt 
 
 at a quarter to eleven the gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms the weather have been more different from their match against hufflepuff it was a clear cool day with a very light breeze there would be no visibility problems this time and harry though nervous was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch match could bring they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond harry took off his black school robes removed his wand from his pocket and stuck it inside the he was going to wear under his quidditch robes he only hoped he need it he wondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd watching 
 
 you know what got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms if we lose this match out of the running just just fly like you did in practice yesterday and be okay 
 
 they walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause the ravenclaw team dressed in blue were already standing in the middle of the field their seeker cho chang was the only girl on their team she was shorter than harry by about a head and harry help noticing nervous as he was that she was extremely pretty she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he think had anything to do with nerves 
 
 wood davies shake hands madam hooch said briskly and wood shook hands with the ravenclaw captain 
 
 mount your brooms on my whistle three two one 
 
 harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordan 
 
 off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstick the going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this world championship 
 
 jordan would you mind telling us going on in the match interrupted professor voice 
 
 right you are professor just giving a bit of background information the firebolt incidentally has a and 
 
 jordan 
 
 okay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goal 
 
 harry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across him forcing him to change direction 
 
 show her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for alicia 
 
 harry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriers 
 
 harry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him harry was speeding up excitement flooding him dives were his specialty he was ten feet away 
 
 then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanished 
 
 there was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw end george weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it 
 
 gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go really putting it through its paces now see it turn comet is just no match for it the precision balance is really noticeable in these long 
 
 jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with the commentary 
 
 ravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points ahead if cho got the snitch before him ravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post 
 
 harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him 
 
 harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have to 
 
 harry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herselfall right thenif she wanted to tail him have to take the consequences 
 
 he dived again and cho thinking seen the snitch tried to follow harry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw end 
 
 he accelerated so many feet below did cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second then 
 
 oh screamed cho pointing 
 
 distracted harry looked down 
 
 three dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at him 
 
 he stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronum 
 
 something something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but pause to watch his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitch 
 
 madam whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowd 
 
 my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd 
 
 yes ron yelled yanking arm into the air yes yes 
 
 well done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to me must find penelope excuse me 
 
 good for you harry roared seamus finnigan 
 
 ruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindors 
 
 that was quite some patronus said a voice in ear 
 
 harry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleased 
 
 the dementors affect me at all harry said excitedly i feel a thing 
 
 that would be because they er dementors said professor lupin come and see 
 
 he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field 
 
 you gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupin 
 
 harry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoy crabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagall 
 
 an unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes now 
 
 if anything could have set the seal on victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to side doubled up with laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe head still stuck inside it 
 
 come on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room now 
 
 right said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castle 
 
 
 
 it felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweets 
 
 how did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowd 
 
 with a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in ear 
 
 only one person joining in the festivities hermione incredibly was sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her 
 
 did you even come to the match he asked her 
 
 of course i did said hermione in a strangely voice not looking up and very glad we won and i think you did really well but i need to read this by monday 
 
 come on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet 
 
 i harry still got four hundred and pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway she glanced over at ron too he want me to join in 
 
 there was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudly if scabbers just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them 
 
 hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sight 
 
 you give her a break harry asked ron quietly 
 
 no said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry but never admit wrong hermione still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or something 
 
 the gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his shut to block out a ray of moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep 
 
 he had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a run and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat out and ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and 
 
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrggghhhhhhh nooooooooooooooooooooooo 
 
 harry woke as suddenly as though been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings he could hear movements around him and seamus voice from the other side of the room 
 
 going on 
 
 harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same moment dean thomas lit his lamp 
 
 ron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his face 
 
 black sirius black with a knife 
 
 what 
 
 here just now slashed the curtains woke me up 
 
 you sure you dreaming ron said dean 
 
 look at the curtains i tell you he was here 
 
 they all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door first and they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after them 
 
 who shouted 
 
 you doing 
 
 the common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was deserted 
 
 are you sure you dreaming ron 
 
 telling you i saw him 
 
 all the noise 
 
 professor mcgonagall told us to go to bed 
 
 a few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling on dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearing 
 
 excellent are we carrying on said fred weasley brightly 
 
 everyone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke 
 
 perce sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me up 
 
 the common room went very still 
 
 nonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron had a nightmare 
 
 telling you 
 
 now really enough 
 
 professor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around 
 
 i am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of you 
 
 i certainly authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all t 
 
 o get back to bed my brother ron here had a nightmare 
 
 it a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knife 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared at him 
 
 be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole 
 
 ask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir picture ask him if he saw 
 
 glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor tower 
 
 certainly good lady cried sir cadogan 
 
 there was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common room 
 
 you you did said professor mcgonagall but but the password 
 
 he had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole my lady read em off a little piece of paper 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalk 
 
 which person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this passwords and left them lying around 
 
 there was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks neville longbottom trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes raised his hand slowly into the air 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban

 mount your brooms on my whistle three two one 
 
 harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordan 
 
 off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstick the going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this world championship 
 
 jordan would you mind telling us going on in the match interrupted professor voice 
 
 right you are professor just giving a bit of background information the firebolt incidentally has a and 
 
 jordan 
 
 okay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goal 
 
 harry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across him forcing him to change direction 
 
 show her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for alicia 
 
 harry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriers 
 
 harry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him harry was speeding up excitement flooding him dives were his specialty he was ten feet away 
 
 then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanished 
 
 there was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw end george weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it 
 
 gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go really putting it through its paces now see it turn comet is just no match for it the precision balance is really noticeable in these long 
 
 jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with the commentary 
 
 ravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points ahead if cho got the snitch before him ravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post 
 
 harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him 
 
 harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have to 
 
 harry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herselfall right thenif she wanted to tail him have to take the consequences 
 
 he dived again and cho thinking seen the snitch tried to follow harry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw end 
 
 he accelerated so many feet below did cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second then 
 
 oh screamed cho pointing 
 
 distracted harry looked down 
 
 three dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at him 
 
 he stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronum 
 
 something something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but pause to watch his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitch 
 
 madam whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowd 
 
 my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd 
 
 yes ron yelled yanking arm into the air yes yes 
 
 well done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to me must find penelope excuse me 
 
 good for you harry roared seamus finnigan 
 
 ruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindors 
 
 that was quite some patronus said a voice in ear 
 
 harry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleased 
 
 the dementors affect me at all harry said excitedly i feel a thing 
 
 that would be because they er dementors said professor lupin come and see 
 
 he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field 
 
 you gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupin 
 
 harry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoy crabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagall 
 
 an unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes now 
 
 if anything could have set the seal on victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to side doubled up with laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe head still stuck inside it 
 
 come on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room now 
 
 right said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castle 
 
 
 
 it felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweets 
 
 how did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowd 
 
 with a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in ear 
 
 only one person joining in the festivities hermione incredibly was sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her 
 
 did you even come to the match he asked her 
 
 of course i did said hermione in a strangely voice not looking up and very glad we won and i think you did really well but i need to read this by monday 
 
 come on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet 
 
 i harry still got four hundred and pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway she glanced over at ron too he want me to join in 
 
 there was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudly if scabbers just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them 
 
 hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sight 
 
 you give her a break harry asked ron quietly 
 
 no said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry but never admit wrong hermione still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or something 
 
 the gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his shut to block out a ray of moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep 
 
 he had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a run and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat out and ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and 
 
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrggghhhhhhh nooooooooooooooooooooooo 
 
 harry woke as suddenly as though been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings he could hear movements around him and seamus voice from the other side of the room 
 
 going on 
 
 harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same moment dean thomas lit his lamp 
 
 ron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his face 
 
 black sirius black with a knife 
 
 what 
 
 here just now slashed the curtains woke me up 
 
 you sure you dreaming ron said dean 
 
 look at the curtains i tell you he was here 
 
 they all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door first and they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after them 
 
 who shouted 
 
 you doing 
 
 the common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was deserted 
 
 are you sure you dreaming ron 
 
 telling you i saw him 
 
 all the noise 
 
 professor mcgonagall told us to go to bed 
 
 a few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling on dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearing 
 
 excellent are we carrying on said fred weasley brightly 
 
 everyone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke 
 
 perce sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me up 
 
 the common room went very still 
 
 nonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron had a nightmare 
 
 telling you 
 
 now really enough 
 
 professor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around 
 
 i am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of you 
 
 i certainly authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all t 
 
 o get back to bed my brother ron here had a nightmare 
 
 it a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knife 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared at him 
 
 be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole 
 
 ask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir picture ask him if he saw 
 
 glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor tower 
 
 certainly good lady cried sir cadogan 
 
 there was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common room 
 
 you you did said professor mcgonagall but but the password 
 
 he had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole my lady read em off a little piece of paper 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalk 
 
 which person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this passwords and left them lying around 
 
 there was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks neville longbottom trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes raised his hand slowly into the air 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen moodycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the storm had blown itself out by the following morning though the ceiling in the great hall was still gloomy heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as harry ron and hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast a few seats along fred george and lee jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the triwizard tournament 
 
 not badoutside all morning said ron who was running his finger down the monday column of his schedule herbology with the hufflepuffs and care of magical creaturesdamn it still with the slytherins 
 
 double divination this afternoon harry groaned looking down divination was his least favorite subject apart from potions professor trelawney kept predicting death which he found extremely annoying 
 
 you should have given it up like me you said hermione briskly buttering herself some toast then be doing something sensible like arithmancy 
 
 eating again i notice said ron watching hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too 
 
 decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights said hermione haughtily 
 
 yeahand you were hungry said ron grinning 
 
 there was a sudden rustling noise above them and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail instinctively harry looked up but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray the owls circled the tables looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed a large tawny owl soared down to neville longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap neville almost always forgot to pack something on the other side of the hall draco eagle owl had landed on his shoulder carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach harry returned to his porridge was it possible that something had happened to hedwig and that sirius even got his letter 
 
 his preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three but here he was distracted by professor sprout showing the class the ugliest plants harry had ever seen indeed they looked less like plants than thick black giant slugs protruding vertically out of the soil each was squirming slightly and had a number of large shiny swellings upon it which appeared to be full of liquid 
 
 bubotubers professor sprout told them briskly they need squeezing you will collect the pus 
 
 the what said seamus finnigan sounding revolted 
 
 pus finnigan pus said professor sprout and extremely valuable so waste it you will collect the pus i say in these bottles wear your gloves it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted bubotuber pus 
 
 squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting but oddly satisfying as each swelling was popped a large amount of thick liquid burst forth which smelled strongly of petrol they caught it in the bottles as professor sprout had indicated and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints 
 
 keep madam pomfrey happy said professor sprout stoppering the last bottle with a cork an excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne bubotuber pus should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples 
 
 like poor eloise midgen said hannah abbott a hufflepuff in a hushed voice she tried to curse hers off 
 
 silly girl said professor sprout shaking her head but madam pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end 
 
 a booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds signaling the end of the lesson and the class separated the hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for transfiguration and the gryffindors heading in the other direction down the sloping lawn toward small wooden cabin which stood on the edge of the forbidden forest 
 
 hagrid was standing outside his hut one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound fang there were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet and fang was whimpering and straining at his collar apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely as they drew nearer an odd rattling noise reached their ears punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions 
 
 mornin hagrid said grinning at harry ron and hermione wait fer the slytherins they won want ter miss this skrewts 
 
 come again said ron 
 
 hagrid pointed down into the crates 
 
 eurgh squealed lavender brown jumping backward 
 
 eurgh just about summed up the skrewts in opinion they looked like deformed lobsters horribly pale and with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads there were about a hundred of them in each crate each about six inches long crawling over one another bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes they were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish every now and then sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt and with a small phut it would be propelled forward several inches 
 
 jus hatched said hagrid proudly so be able ter raise em yerselves thought make a bit of a project of it 
 
 and why would we want to raise them said a cold voice 
 
 the slytherins had arrived the speaker was draco malfoy crabbe and goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words 
 
 hagrid looked stumped at the question 
 
 i mean what do they do asked malfoy what is the point of them 
 
 hagrid opened his mouth apparently thinking hard there was a few seconds pause then he said roughly next lesson malfoy yer jus feedin em today now wan ter try em on a few things never had em before not sure what go fer i got ant eggs an frog livers an a bit o grass snake just try em out with a bit of each 
 
 first pus and now this muttered seamus 
 
 nothing but deep affection for hagrid could have made harry ron and hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the skrewts harry suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless because the skrewts seem to have mouths 
 
 ouch yelled dean thomas after about ten minutes it got me 
 
 hagrid hurried over to him looking anxious 
 
 its end exploded said dean angrily showing hagrid a burn on his hand 
 
 ah yeah that can happen when they blast off said hagrid nodding 
 
 eurgh said lavender brown again eurgh hagrid that pointy thing on it 
 
 ah some of em have got stings said hagrid enthusiastically lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box i reckon the got sorta sucker things on their think they might be ter suck blood 
 
 well i can certainly see why trying to keep them alive said malfoy sarcastically who want pets that can burn sting and bite all at once 
 
 just because not very pretty it mean not useful hermione snapped dragon amazingly magical but you want a dragon for a pet would you 
 
 harry and ron grinned at hagrid who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon as harry ron and hermione knew only too well he had owned one for a brief period during their first year a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures the more lethal the better 
 
 well at least the skrewts are small said ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later 
 
 they are now said hermione in an exasperated voice but once found out what they eat i expect be six feet long 
 
 well that matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something will it said ron grinning slyly at her 
 
 you know perfectly well i only said that to shut malfoy up said hermione as a matter of fact i think right the best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all 
 
 they sat down at the gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes hermione began to eat so fast that harry and ron stared at her 
 
 er is this the new stand on elf rights said ron going to make yourself puke instead 
 
 no said hermione with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts i just want to get to the library 
 
 what said ron in disbelief hermione the first day back we even got homework yet 
 
 hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days then she leapt to her feet said see you at dinner and departed at high speed 
 
 when the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons harry and ron set off for north tower where at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling and the room where professor trelawney lived 
 
 the familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder as ever the curtains were all closed the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps which were all draped with scarves and shawls harry and ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room and sat down at the same small circular table 
 
 good day said the misty voice of professor trelawney right behind harry making him jump 
 
 a very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face professor trelawney was peering down at harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him the usual large amount of beads chains and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight 
 
 you are preoccupied my dear she said mournfully to harry my inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within and i regret to say that your worries are not baseless i see difficult times ahead for you alasmost difficulti fear the thing you dread will indeed come to perhaps sooner than you think 
 
 her voice dropped almost to a whisper ron rolled his eyes at harry who looked stonily back professor trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire facing the class lavender brown and parvati patil who deeply admired professor trelawney were sitting on poufs very close to her 
 
 my dears it is time for us to consider the stars she said the movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays which intermingle 
 
 but thoughts had drifted the perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and and professor rambling talks on never held him exactly spellbound though he help thinking about what she had just said to him i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass 
 
 but hermione was right harry thought irritably professor trelawney really was an old fraud he dreading anything at the moment at allwell unless you counted his fears that sirius had been caughtbut what did professor trelawney know he had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner 
 
 except of course for that time at the end of last term when she had made the prediction about voldemort rising againand dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine when harry had described it to him 
 
 harry ron muttered 
 
 what 
 
 harry looked around the whole class was staring at him he sat up straight he had been almost dozing off lost in the heat and his thoughts 
 
 i was saying my dear that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of saturn said professor trelawney a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words 
 
 born under what sorry said harry 
 
 saturn dear the planet saturn said professor trelawney sounding definitely irritated that he riveted by this news i was saying that saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your dark hairyour mean staturetragic losses so young in lifei think i am right in saying my dear that you were born in midwinter 
 
 no said harry i was born in july 
 
 ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough 
 
 half an hour later each of them had been given a complicated circular chart and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth it was dull work requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles 
 
 got two neptunes here said harry after a while frowning down at his piece of parchment that be right can it 
 
 aaaaah said ron imitating professor mystical whisper when two neptunes appear in the sky it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born harry 
 
 seamus and dean who were working nearby sniggered loudly though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from lavender brown oh professor look i think got an unaspected planet oooh which that professor 
 
 it is uranus my dear said professor trelawney peering down at the chart 
 
 can i have a look at uranus too lavender said ron 
 
 most unfortunately professor trelawney heard him and it was this perhaps that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class 
 
 a detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you with reference to your personal chart she snapped sounding much more like professor mcgonagall than her usual self i want it ready to hand in next monday and no excuses 
 
 miserable old bat said ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the great hall and dinner take all weekend that will 
 
 lots of homework said hermione brightly catching up with them professor vector give us any at all 
 
 well bully for professor vector said ron moodily 
 
 they reached the entrance hall which was packed with people queuing for dinner they had just joined the end of the line when a loud voice rang out behind them 
 
 weasley hey weasley 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing there each looking thoroughly pleased about something 
 
 what said ron shortly 
 
 your in the paper weasley said malfoy brandishing a copy of the daily prophet and speaking very loudly so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear listen to this 
 
 further mistakes at the ministry of magic 
 it seems as though the ministry of troubles are not yet at an end writes rita skeeter special correspondent recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the quidditch world cup and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches the ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of arnold weasley of the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 malfoy looked up 
 
 imagine them not even getting his name right weasley almost as though a complete nonentity it he crowed 
 
 everyone in the entrance hall was listening now malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on 
 
 arnold weasley who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle policemen over a number of highly aggressive dustbins mr weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of moody the aged who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder unsurprisingly mr weasley found upon arrival at mr heavily guarded house that mr moody had once again raised a false alarm mr weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene 
 and a picture weasley said malfoy flipping the paper over and holding it up a picture of your parents outside their house if you can call it a house your mother could do with losing a bit of weight she 
 
 ron was shaking with fury everyone was staring at him 
 
 get stuffed malfoy said harry ron 
 
 oh yeah you were staying with them this summer you potter sneered malfoy so tell me is his mother really that porky or is it just the picture 
 
 you know your mother malfoy said harry both he and hermione had grabbed the back of robes to stop him from launching himself at malfoy that expression got like got dung under her nose has she always looked like that or was it just because you were with her 
 
 pale face went slightly pink 
 
 you dare insult my mother potter 
 
 keep your fat mouth shut then said harry turning away 
 
 bang 
 
 several people screamed harry felt something graze the side of his face he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand but before even touched it he heard a second loud bang and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall 
 
 oh no you laddie 
 
 harry spun around professor moody was limping down the marble staircase his wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret which was shivering on the floor exactly where malfoy had been standing 
 
 there was a terrified silence in the entrance hall nobody but moody was moving a muscle moody turned to look at harry at least his normal eye was looking at harry the other one was pointing into the back of his head 
 
 did he get you moody growled his voice was low and gravelly 
 
 no said harry missed 
 
 leave it moody shouted 
 
 leave what harry said bewildered 
 
 not you him moody growled jerking his thumb over his shoulder at crabbe who had just frozen about to pick up the white ferret it seemed that rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head 
 
 moody started to limp toward crabbe goyle and the ferret which gave a terrified squeak and took off streaking toward the dungeons 
 
 i think so roared moody pointing his wand at the ferret again it flew ten feet into the air fell with a smack to the floor and then bounced upward once more 
 
 i like people who attack when their turned growled moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher squealing in pain stinking cowardly scummy thing to do 
 
 the ferret flew through the air its legs and tail flailing helplessly 
 
 never do that again said moody speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again 
 
 professor moody said a shocked voice 
 
 professor mcgonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books 
 
 hello professor mcgonagall said moody calmly bouncing the ferret still higher 
 
 what what are you doing said professor mcgonagall her eyes following the bouncing progress through the air 
 
 teaching said moody 
 
 teach moody is that a student shrieked professor mcgonagall the books spilling out of her arms 
 
 yep said moody 
 
 no cried professor mcgonagall running down the stairs and pulling out her wand a moment later with a loud snapping noise draco malfoy had reappeared lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face he got to his feet wincing 
 
 moody we never use transfiguration as a punishment said professor mcgonagall wealdy surely professor dumbledore told you that 
 
 he mentioned it yeah said moody scratching his chin unconcernedly but i thought a good sharp shock 
 
 we give detentions moody or speak to the head of house 
 
 do that then said moody staring at malfoy with great dislike 
 
 malfoy whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation looked malevolently up at moody and muttered something in which the words my father were distinguishable 
 
 oh yeah said moody quietly limping forward a few steps the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall well i know your father of old tell him keeping a close eye on his sonyou tell him that from your head of be snape will it 
 
 yes said malfoy resentfully 
 
 another old friend growled moody been looking forward to a chat with old on you 
 
 and he seized upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments then waved her wand at her fallen books causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms 
 
 talk to me ron said quietly to harry and hermione as they sat down at the gryffindor table a few minutes later surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened 
 
 why not said hermione in surprise 
 
 because i want to fix that in my memory forever said ron his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face draco malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret 
 
 harry and hermione both laughed and hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates 
 
 he could have really hurt malfoy though she said it was good really that professor mcgonagall stopped it 
 
 hermione said ron furiously his eyes snapping open again ruining the best moment of my life 
 
 hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again 
 
 tell me going back to the library this evening said harry watching her 
 
 got to said hermione thickly loads to do 
 
 but you told us professor vector 
 
 not schoolwork she said within five minutes she had cleared her plate and departed no sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by fred weasley 
 
 moody he said how cool is he 
 
 beyond cool said george sitting down opposite fred 
 
 supercool said the twins best friend lee jordan sliding into the seat beside george we had him this afternoon he told harry and ron 
 
 what was it like said harry eagerly 
 
 fred george and lee exchanged looks full of meaning 
 
 never had a lesson like it said fred 
 
 he knows man said lee 
 
 knows what said ron leaning forward 
 
 knows what like to be out there doing it said george impressively 
 
 doing what said harry 
 
 fighting the dark arts said fred 
 
 seen it all said george 
 
 mazing said lee 
 
 ron dived into his bag for his schedule 
 
 we got him till thursday he said in a disappointed voice 
 
 rowling

 yeahand you were hungry said ron grinning 
 
 there was a sudden rustling noise above them and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail instinctively harry looked up but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray the owls circled the tables looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed a large tawny owl soared down to neville longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap neville almost always forgot to pack something on the other side of the hall draco eagle owl had landed on his shoulder carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach harry returned to his porridge was it possible that something had happened to hedwig and that sirius even got his letter 
 
 his preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three but here he was distracted by professor sprout showing the class the ugliest plants harry had ever seen indeed they looked less like plants than thick black giant slugs protruding vertically out of the soil each was squirming slightly and had a number of large shiny swellings upon it which appeared to be full of liquid 
 
 bubotubers professor sprout told them briskly they need squeezing you will collect the pus 
 
 the what said seamus finnigan sounding revolted 
 
 pus finnigan pus said professor sprout and extremely valuable so waste it you will collect the pus i say in these bottles wear your gloves it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted bubotuber pus 
 
 squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting but oddly satisfying as each swelling was popped a large amount of thick liquid burst forth which smelled strongly of petrol they caught it in the bottles as professor sprout had indicated and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints 
 
 keep madam pomfrey happy said professor sprout stoppering the last bottle with a cork an excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne bubotuber pus should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples 
 
 like poor eloise midgen said hannah abbott a hufflepuff in a hushed voice she tried to curse hers off 
 
 silly girl said professor sprout shaking her head but madam pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end 
 
 a booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds signaling the end of the lesson and the class separated the hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for transfiguration and the gryffindors heading in the other direction down the sloping lawn toward small wooden cabin which stood on the edge of the forbidden forest 
 
 hagrid was standing outside his hut one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound fang there were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet and fang was whimpering and straining at his collar apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely as they drew nearer an odd rattling noise reached their ears punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions 
 
 mornin hagrid said grinning at harry ron and hermione wait fer the slytherins they won want ter miss this skrewts 
 
 come again said ron 
 
 hagrid pointed down into the crates 
 
 eurgh squealed lavender brown jumping backward 
 
 eurgh just about summed up the skrewts in opinion they looked like deformed lobsters horribly pale and with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads there were about a hundred of them in each crate each about six inches long crawling over one another bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes they were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish every now and then sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt and with a small phut it would be propelled forward several inches 
 
 jus hatched said hagrid proudly so be able ter raise em yerselves thought make a bit of a project of it 
 
 and why would we want to raise them said a cold voice 
 
 the slytherins had arrived the speaker was draco malfoy crabbe and goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words 
 
 hagrid looked stumped at the question 
 
 i mean what do they do asked malfoy what is the point of them 
 
 hagrid opened his mouth apparently thinking hard there was a few seconds pause then he said roughly next lesson malfoy yer jus feedin em today now wan ter try em on a few things never had em before not sure what go fer i got ant eggs an frog livers an a bit o grass snake just try em out with a bit of each 
 
 first pus and now this muttered seamus 
 
 nothing but deep affection for hagrid could have made harry ron and hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the skrewts harry suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless because the skrewts seem to have mouths 
 
 ouch yelled dean thomas after about ten minutes it got me 
 
 hagrid hurried over to him looking anxious 
 
 its end exploded said dean angrily showing hagrid a burn on his hand 
 
 ah yeah that can happen when they blast off said hagrid nodding 
 
 eurgh said lavender brown again eurgh hagrid that pointy thing on it 
 
 ah some of em have got stings said hagrid enthusiastically lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box i reckon the got sorta sucker things on their think they might be ter suck blood 
 
 well i can certainly see why trying to keep them alive said malfoy sarcastically who want pets that can burn sting and bite all at once 
 
 just because not very pretty it mean not useful hermione snapped dragon amazingly magical but you want a dragon for a pet would you 
 
 harry and ron grinned at hagrid who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon as harry ron and hermione knew only too well he had owned one for a brief period during their first year a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures the more lethal the better 
 
 well at least the skrewts are small said ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later 
 
 they are now said hermione in an exasperated voice but once found out what they eat i expect be six feet long 
 
 well that matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something will it said ron grinning slyly at her 
 
 you know perfectly well i only said that to shut malfoy up said hermione as a matter of fact i think right the best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all 
 
 they sat down at the gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes hermione began to eat so fast that harry and ron stared at her 
 
 er is this the new stand on elf rights said ron going to make yourself puke instead 
 
 no said hermione with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts i just want to get to the library 
 
 what said ron in disbelief hermione the first day back we even got homework yet 
 
 hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days then she leapt to her feet said see you at dinner and departed at high speed 
 
 when the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons harry and ron set off for north tower where at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling and the room where professor trelawney lived 
 
 the familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder as ever the curtains were all closed the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps which were all draped with scarves and shawls harry and ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room and sat down at the same small circular table 
 
 good day said the misty voice of professor trelawney right behind harry making him jump 
 
 a very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face professor trelawney was peering down at harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him the usual large amount of beads chains and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight 
 
 you are preoccupied my dear she said mournfully to harry my inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within and i regret to say that your worries are not baseless i see difficult times ahead for you alasmost difficulti fear the thing you dread will indeed come to perhaps sooner than you think 
 
 her voice dropped almost to a whisper ron rolled his eyes at harry who looked stonily back professor trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire facing the class lavender brown and parvati patil who deeply admired professor trelawney were sitting on poufs very close to her 
 
 my dears it is time for us to consider the stars she said the movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays which intermingle 
 
 but thoughts had drifted the perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and and professor rambling talks on never held him exactly spellbound though he help thinking about what she had just said to him i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass 
 
 but hermione was right harry thought irritably professor trelawney really was an old fraud he dreading anything at the moment at allwell unless you counted his fears that sirius had been caughtbut what did professor trelawney know he had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner 
 
 except of course for that time at the end of last term when she had made the prediction about voldemort rising againand dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine when harry had described it to him 
 
 harry ron muttered 
 
 what 
 
 harry looked around the whole class was staring at him he sat up straight he had been almost dozing off lost in the heat and his thoughts 
 
 i was saying my dear that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of saturn said professor trelawney a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words 
 
 born under what sorry said harry 
 
 saturn dear the planet saturn said professor trelawney sounding definitely irritated that he riveted by this news i was saying that saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your dark hairyour mean staturetragic losses so young in lifei think i am right in saying my dear that you were born in midwinter 
 
 no said harry i was born in july 
 
 ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough 
 
 half an hour later each of them had been given a complicated circular chart and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth it was dull work requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles 
 
 got two neptunes here said harry after a while frowning down at his piece of parchment that be right can it 
 
 aaaaah said ron imitating professor mystical whisper when two neptunes appear in the sky it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born harry 
 
 seamus and dean who were working nearby sniggered loudly though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from lavender brown oh professor look i think got an unaspected planet oooh which that professor 
 
 it is uranus my dear said professor trelawney peering down at the chart 
 
 can i have a look at uranus too lavender said ron 
 
 most unfortunately professor trelawney heard him and it was this perhaps that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class 
 
 a detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you with reference to your personal chart she snapped sounding much more like professor mcgonagall than her usual self i want it ready to hand in next monday and no excuses 
 
 miserable old bat said ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the great hall and dinner take all weekend that will 
 
 lots of homework said hermione brightly catching up with them professor vector give us any at all 
 
 well bully for professor vector said ron moodily 
 
 they reached the entrance hall which was packed with people queuing for dinner they had just joined the end of the line when a loud voice rang out behind them 
 
 weasley hey weasley 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing there each looking thoroughly pleased about something 
 
 what said ron shortly 
 
 your in the paper weasley said malfoy brandishing a copy of the daily prophet and speaking very loudly so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear listen to this 
 
 further mistakes at the ministry of magic 
 it seems as though the ministry of troubles are not yet at an end writes rita skeeter special correspondent recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the quidditch world cup and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches the ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of arnold weasley of the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 malfoy looked up 
 
 imagine them not even getting his name right weasley almost as though a complete nonentity it he crowed 
 
 everyone in the entrance hall was listening now malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on 
 
 arnold weasley who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle policemen over a number of highly aggressive dustbins mr weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of moody the aged who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder unsurprisingly mr weasley found upon arrival at mr heavily guarded house that mr moody had once again raised a false alarm mr weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene 
 and a picture weasley said malfoy flipping the paper over and holding it up a picture of your parents outside their house if you can call it a house your mother could do with losing a bit of weight she 
 
 ron was shaking with fury everyone was staring at him 
 
 get stuffed malfoy said harry ron 
 
 oh yeah you were staying with them this summer you potter sneered malfoy so tell me is his mother really that porky or is it just the picture 
 
 you know your mother malfoy said harry both he and hermione had grabbed the back of robes to stop him from launching himself at malfoy that expression got like got dung under her nose has she always looked like that or was it just because you were with her 
 
 pale face went slightly pink 
 
 you dare insult my mother potter 
 
 keep your fat mouth shut then said harry turning away 
 
 bang 
 
 several people screamed harry felt something graze the side of his face he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand but before even touched it he heard a second loud bang and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall 
 
 oh no you laddie 
 
 harry spun around professor moody was limping down the marble staircase his wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret which was shivering on the floor exactly where malfoy had been standing 
 
 there was a terrified silence in the entrance hall nobody but moody was moving a muscle moody turned to look at harry at least his normal eye was looking at harry the other one was pointing into the back of his head 
 
 did he get you moody growled his voice was low and gravelly 
 
 no said harry missed 
 
 leave it moody shouted 
 
 leave what harry said bewildered 
 
 not you him moody growled jerking his thumb over his shoulder at crabbe who had just frozen about to pick up the white ferret it seemed that rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head 
 
 moody started to limp toward crabbe goyle and the ferret which gave a terrified squeak and took off streaking toward the dungeons 
 
 i think so roared moody pointing his wand at the ferret again it flew ten feet into the air fell with a smack to the floor and then bounced upward once more 
 
 i like people who attack when their turned growled moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher squealing in pain stinking cowardly scummy thing to do 
 
 the ferret flew through the air its legs and tail flailing helplessly 
 
 never do that again said moody speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again 
 
 professor moody said a shocked voice 
 
 professor mcgonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books 
 
 hello professor mcgonagall said moody calmly bouncing the ferret still higher 
 
 what what are you doing said professor mcgonagall her eyes following the bouncing progress through the air 
 
 teaching said moody 
 
 teach moody is that a student shrieked professor mcgonagall the books spilling out of her arms 
 
 yep said moody 
 
 no cried professor mcgonagall running down the stairs and pulling out her wand a moment later with a loud snapping noise draco malfoy had reappeared lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face he got to his feet wincing 
 
 moody we never use transfiguration as a punishment said professor mcgonagall wealdy surely professor dumbledore told you that 
 
 he mentioned it yeah said moody scratching his chin unconcernedly but i thought a good sharp shock 
 
 we give detentions moody or speak to the head of house 
 
 do that then said moody staring at malfoy with great dislike 
 
 malfoy whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation looked malevolently up at moody and muttered something in which the words my father were distinguishable 
 
 oh yeah said moody quietly limping forward a few steps the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall well i know your father of old tell him keeping a close eye on his sonyou tell him that from your head of be snape will it 
 
 yes said malfoy resentfully 
 
 another old friend growled moody been looking forward to a chat with old on you 
 
 and he seized upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments then waved her wand at her fallen books causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms 
 
 talk to me ron said quietly to harry and hermione as they sat down at the gryffindor table a few minutes later surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened 
 
 why not said hermione in surprise 
 
 because i want to fix that in my memory forever said ron his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face draco malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret 
 
 harry and hermione both laughed and hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates 
 
 he could have really hurt malfoy though she said it was good really that professor mcgonagall stopped it 
 
 hermione said ron furiously his eyes snapping open again ruining the best moment of my life 
 
 hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again 
 
 tell me going back to the library this evening said harry watching her 
 
 got to said hermione thickly loads to do 
 
 but you told us professor vector 
 
 not schoolwork she said within five minutes she had cleared her plate and departed no sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by fred weasley 
 
 moody he said how cool is he 
 
 beyond cool said george sitting down opposite fred 
 
 supercool said the twins best friend lee jordan sliding into the seat beside george we had him this afternoon he told harry and ron 
 
 what was it like said harry eagerly 
 
 fred george and lee exchanged looks full of meaning 
 
 never had a lesson like it said fred 
 
 he knows man said lee 
 
 knows what said ron leaning forward 
 
 knows what like to be out there doing it said george impressively 
 
 doing what said harry 
 
 fighting the dark arts said fred 
 
 seen it all said george 
 
 mazing said lee 
 
 ron dived into his bag for his schedule 
 
 we got him till thursday he said in a disappointed voice 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen dentention with delorescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dinner in the great hall that night was not a pleasant experience for harry the news about his shouting match with umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by hogwarts standards he heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between ron and hermione the funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him on the contrary it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again so that they could hear his story 
 
 he says he saw cedric diggory murdered 
 
 he reckons he duelled with 
 
 come off it 
 
 who does he think kidding 
 
 
 
 what i get said harry through clenched teeth laying down his knife and fork his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady is why they all believed the story two months ago when dumbledore told them 
 
 the thing is harry not sure they did said hermione grimly oh get out of here 
 
 she slammed down her own knife and fork ron looked longingly at his apple pie but followed suit people stared at them all the way out of the hall 
 
 what mean not sure they believed dumbledore harry asked hermione when they reached the landing 
 
 look you understand what it was like after it happened said hermione quietly you arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching dead body none of us saw what what happened in the maze we just had word for it that had come back and killed cedric and fought you 
 
 which is the truth said harry loudly 
 
 i know it is harry so will you please stop biting my head off said hermione wearily just that before the truth could sink in everyone went home for the summer where they spent two months reading about how a nutcase and going senile 
 
 rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to gryffindor tower harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed a dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye he glanced out of a window at the dark grounds as they turned into the fat corridor there was still no light in cabin 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia said hermione before the fat lady could ask the portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it 
 
 the common room was almost empty nearly everyone was still down at dinner crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them purring loudly and when harry ron and hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion harry gazed into the flames feeling drained and exhausted 
 
 how can dumbledore have let this happen hermione cried suddenly making harry and ron jump crookshanks leapt off her looking affronted she pounded the arms of her chair in fury so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes how can he let that terrible woman teach us and in our owl year too 
 
 well never had great defence against the dark arts teachers have we said harry you know what like hagrid told us nobody wants the job they say jinxed 
 
 yes but to employ someone actually refusing to let us do magic dumbledore playing at 
 
 and trying to get people to spy for her said ron darkly 
 
 remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying back 
 
 of course here to spy on us all obvious why else would fudge have wanted her to come snapped hermione 
 
 start arguing again said harry wearily as ron opened his mouth to retaliate we just just do that homework get it out of the way 
 
 they collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire people were coming back from dinner now harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole but could still sense the stares he was attracting 
 
 shall we do stuff first said ron dipping his quill into his ink the properties of moonstone and its uses in he muttered writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them there he underlined the title then looked up expectantly at hermione 
 
 so what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in 
 
 but hermione was not listening she was squinting over into the far corner of the room where fred george and lee jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that fred was holding 
 
 no sorry gone too far she said standing up and looking positively furious come on ron 
 
 i what said ron plainly playing for time nocome on hermionewe tell them off for giving out sweets 
 
 you know perfectly well that those are bits of nosebleed nougat oror puking pastilles or 
 
 fainting fancies harry suggested quietly 
 
 one by one as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet the were slumping unconscious in their seats some slid right on to the floor others merely hung over the arms of their chairs their tongues lolling out most of the people watching were laughing hermione however squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where fred and george now stood with clipboards closely observing the unconscious ron rose halfway out of his chair hovered uncertainly for a moment or two then muttered to harry got it under control before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted 
 
 enough hermione said forcefully to fred and george both of whom looked up in mild surprise 
 
 yeah right said george nodding this dosage looks strong enough it 
 
 i told you this morning you test your rubbish on students 
 
 paying them said fred indignantly 
 
 i care it could be dangerous 
 
 rubbish said fred 
 
 calm down hermione fine said lee reassuringly as he walked from to inserting purple sweets into their open mouths 
 
 yeah look coming round now said george 
 
 a few of the were indeed stirring several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor or dangling off their chairs that harry was sure fred and george had not warned them what the sweets were going to do 
 
 feel all right said george kindly to a small girl lying at his feet 
 
 ii think so she said shakily 
 
 excellent said fred happily but the next second hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of fainting fancies from his hands 
 
 it is not excellent 
 
 course it is alive they said fred angrily 
 
 you do this what if you made one of them really ill 
 
 not going to make them ill already tested them all on ourselves this is just to see if everyone reacts the same 
 
 if you stop doing it going to 
 
 put us in detention said fred in an voice 
 
 make us write lines said george smirking 
 
 onlookers all over the room were laughing hermione drew herself up to her full height her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity 
 
 no she said her voice quivering with anger but i will write to your mother 
 
 you said george horrified taking a step back from her 
 
 oh yes i would said hermione grimly i stop you eating the stupid things yourselves but not to give them to the 
 
 fred and george looked thunderstruck it was clear that as far as they were concerned threat was way below the belt with a last threatening look at them she thrust clipboard and the bag of fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire 
 
 ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees 
 
 thank you for your support ron hermione said acidly 
 
 you handled it fine by yourself ron mumbled 
 
 hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds then said edgily oh no good i concentrate now going to bed 
 
 she wrenched her bag open harry thought she was about to put her books away but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace covered them with a few bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect 
 
 what in the name of merlin are you doing said ron watching her as though fearful for her sanity 
 
 hats for she said briskly now stuffing her books back into her bag i did them over the summer a really slow knitter without magic but now back at school i should be able to make lots more 
 
 leaving out hats for the said ron slowly and covering them up with rubbish first 
 
 yes said hermione defiantly swinging her bag on to her back 
 
 not on said ron angrily trying to trick them into picking up the hats setting them free when they might not want to be free 
 
 of course they want to be free said hermione at once though her face was turning pink you dare touch those hats ron 
 
 she turned on her heel and left ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls dormitories then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats 
 
 they should at least see what picking up he said firmly anyway he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of essay no point trying to finish this now i do it without hermione i got a clue what supposed to do with moonstones have you 
 
 harry shook his head noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse he thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply knowing perfectly well that when the morning came he would regret not finishing his homework that night he piled his books back into his bag 
 
 going to bed too 
 
 he passed seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories but did not look at him harry had a fleeting impression that seamus had opened his mouth to speak but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation 
 
 the following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast 
 
 but on the plus side no snape today said ron bracingly 
 
 hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee she looked mildly pleased about something and when ron asked her what she had to be so happy about she simply said the hats have gone seems the do want freedom after all 
 
 i bet on it ron told her cuttingly they might not count as clothes they look anything like hats to me more like woolly bladders 
 
 hermione did not speak to him all morning 
 
 double charms was succeeded by double transfiguration professor flitwick and professor mcgonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of owls 
 
 what you must remember said little professor flitwick squeakily perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come if you have not already given serious thought to your careers now is the time to do so and in the meantime afraid we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice 
 
 they then spent over an hour revising summoning charms which according to professor flitwick were bound to come up in their owl and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of charms homework 
 
 it was the same if not worse in transfiguration 
 
 you cannot pass an owl said professor mcgonagall grimly without serious application practice and study i see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an owl in transfiguration as long as they put in the work neville made a sad little disbelieving noise yes you too longbottom said professor mcgonagall nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence so today we are starting vanishing spells these are easier than conjuring spells which you would not usually attempt until newt level but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your owl 
 
 she was quite right harry found the vanishing spells horribly difficult by the end of a double period neither he nor ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising though ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler hermione on the other hand successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt earning her a bonus for gryffindor from professor mcgonagall she was the only person not given homework everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon 
 
 now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do harry and ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in still angry about slur on her woolly hats hermione did not join them by the time they reached care of magical creatures in the afternoon head was aching again 
 
 the day had become cool and breezy and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces professor stood waiting for the class some ten yards from front door a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs as harry and ron reached her a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them turning they saw draco malfoy striding towards them surrounded by his usual gang of slytherin cronies he had clearly just said something highly amusing because crabbe goyle pansy parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and judging by the way they all kept looking over at harry he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty 
 
 everyone here barked professor once all the slytherins and gryffindors had arrived crack on then who can tell me what these things are called 
 
 she indicated the heap of twigs in front of her hand shot into the air behind her back malfoy did a imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question pansy parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny creatures made of wood each with knobbly brown arms and legs two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat barklike face in which a pair of eyes glittered 
 
 oooooh said parvati and lavender thoroughly irritating harry anyone would have thought hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough and the skrewts perhaps too much so 
 
 kindly keep your voices down girls said professor sharply scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the who immediately fell upon the food soanyone know the names of these creatures miss granger 
 
 bowtruckles said hermione usually live in 
 
 five points for gryffindor said professor yes these are bowtruckles and as miss granger rightly says they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality anybody know what they eat 
 
 woodlice said hermione promptly which explained why what harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving but fairy eggs if they can get them 
 
 good girl take another five points so whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it they may not look dangerous but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers which as you can see are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs so if like to gather closer take a few woodlice and a bowtrucklei have enough here for one between threeyou can study them more closely i want a sketch from each of you with all labelled by the end of the lesson 
 
 the class surged forwards around the trestle table harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to professor 
 
 hagrid he asked her while everyone else was choosing bowtruckles 
 
 never you mind said professor repressively which had been her attitude last time hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too smirking all over his pointed face draco malfoy leaned across harry and seized the largest bowtruckle 
 
 maybe said malfoy in an undertone so that only harry could hear him the stupid great got himself badly injured 
 
 maybe you will if you shut up said harry out of the side of his mouth 
 
 maybe been messing with stuff too big for him if you get my drift 
 
 malfoy walked away smirking over his shoulder at harry who felt suddenly sick did malfoy know something his father was a death eater after all what if he had information about fate that had not yet reached the ears of the order he hurried back around the table to ron and hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it harry pulled out parchment and quill crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what malfoy had just said 
 
 dumbledore would know if something had happened to hagrid said hermione at once just playing into hands to look worried it tells him we know exactly going on got to ignore him harry here hold the bowtruckle for a moment just so i can draw its face 
 
 yes came clear drawl from the group nearest them father was talking to the minister just a couple of days ago you know and it sounds as though the really determined to crack down on teaching in this place so even if that overgrown moron does show up again probably be sent packing straightaway 
 
 ouch 
 
 harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers leaving two long deep cuts there harry dropped it crabbe and goyle who had already been guffawing at the idea of hagrid being sacked laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the forest a little moving soon swallowed up among the tree roots when the bell echoed distantly over the grounds harry rolled up his bowtruckle picture and marched off to herbology with his hand wrapped in handkerchief and derisive laughter still ringing in his ears 
 
 if he calls hagrid a moron one more time said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 harry go picking a row with malfoy forget a prefect now he could make life difficult for you 
 
 wow i wonder what be like to have a difficult life said harry sarcastically ron laughed but hermione frowned together they traipsed across the vegetable patch the sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not 
 
 i just wish hagrid would hurry up and get back all said harry in a low voice as they reached the greenhouses and say that a better teacher he added threateningly 
 
 i going to said hermione calmly 
 
 because never be as good as hagrid said harry firmly fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary care of magical creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it 
 
 the door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some spilled out of it including ginny 
 
 hi she said brightly as she passed a few seconds later luna lovegood emerged trailing behind the rest of the class a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head when she saw harry her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him many of his classmates turned curiously to watch luna took a great breath and then said without so much as a preliminary hello i believe he who must not be named is back and i believe you fought him and escaped from him 
 
 erright said harry awkwardly luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings a fact that parvati and lavender seemed to have noticed as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes 
 
 you can laugh luna said her voice rising apparently under the impression that parvati and lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing but people used to believe there were no such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 well they were right they said hermione impatiently there any such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 luna gave her a withering look and flounced away radishes swinging madly parvati and lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now 
 
 mind not offending the only people who believe me harry asked hermione as they made their way into class 
 
 oh for sake harry you can do better than her said hermione told me all about her apparently only believe in things as long as no proof at all well i expect anything else from someone whose father runs the quibbler 
 
 harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how luna had said she could see them too his spirits sank slightly had she been lying but before he could devote much more thought to the matter ernie macmillan had stepped up to him 
 
 i want you to know potter he said in a loud carrying voice that not only weirdos who support you i personally believe you one hundred per cent my family have always stood firm behind dumbledore and so do i 
 
 erthanks very much ernie said harry taken aback but pleased ernie might be pompous on occasions like this but harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears words had certainly wiped the smile from lavender browns face and as he turned to talk to ron and hermione harry caught expression which looked both confused and defiant 
 
 to surprise professor sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of owls harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this he was starting to get an anxious twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do a feeling that worsened dramatically when professor sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung professor sprouts preferred type of fertiliser the gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later none of them talking very much it had been another long day 
 
 as harry was starving and he had his first detention with umbridge at five he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in gryffindor tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him he had barely reached the entrance of the great hall however when a loud and angry voice yelled oi potter 
 
 what now he muttered wearily turning to face angelina johnson who looked as though she was in a towering temper 
 
 tell you what now she said marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger how come landed yourself in detention for five on friday 
 
 what said harry why oh yeah keeper tryouts 
 
 now he remembers snarled angelina i tell you i wanted to do a tryout with the whole team and find someone who fitted in with i tell you booked the quidditch pitch specially and now decided not going to be there 
 
 i decide not to be there said harry stung by the injustice of these words i got detention from that umbridge woman just because i told her the truth about 
 
 well you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en friday said angelina fiercely and i care how you do it tell her a figment of your imagination if you like just make sure there 
 
 she turned on her heel and stormed away 
 
 you know what harry said to ron and hermione as they entered the great hall i think better check with puddlemere united whether oliver been killed during a training session because angelina seems to be channelling his spirit 
 
 what reckon are the odds of umbridge letting you off on friday said ron sceptically as they sat down at the gryffindor table 
 
 less than zero said harry glumly tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat better try though i offer to do two more detentions or something i dunno he swallowed a mouthful of potato and added i hope she keep me too long this evening you realise got to write three essays practise vanishing spells for mcgonagall work out a for flitwick finish the bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for trelawney 
 
 ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling 
 
 and it looks like going to rain 
 
 that got to do with our homework said hermione her eyebrows raised 
 
 nothing said ron at once his ears reddening 
 
 at five to five harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for office on the third floor when he knocked on the door she called come in in a sugary voice he entered cautiously looking around 
 
 he had known this office under three of its previous occupants 
 
 in the days when gilderoy lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself when lupin had occupied it it was likely you would meet some fascinating dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call in the impostor days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment 
 
 now however it looked totally unrecognisable the surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths there were several vases full of dried flowers each one residing on its own doily and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck these were so foul that harry stared at them transfixed until professor umbridge spoke again 
 
 good evening mr potter 
 
 harry started and looked around he had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her 
 
 evening professor umbridge harry said stiffly 
 
 well sit down she said pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a chair a piece of blank parchment lay on the table apparently waiting for him 
 
 er said harry without moving professor umbridge erbefore we start ii wanted to ask you a a favour 
 
 her bulging eyes narrowed 
 
 oh yes 
 
 well in the gryffindor quidditch team and i was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new keeper at five on friday and i waswas wondering whether i could skip detention that night and do itdo it another night instead 
 
 he knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good 
 
 oh no said umbridge smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly oh no no no this is your punishment for spreading evil nasty stories mr potter and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty convenience no you will come here at five tomorrow and the next day and on friday too and you will do your detentions as planned i think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do it ought to reinforce the lesson i am trying to teach you 
 
 harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears so he told evil nasty stones did he 
 
 she was watching him with her head slightly to one side still smiling widely as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again with a massive effort harry looked away from her dropped his schoolbag beside the chair and sat down 
 
 there said umbridge sweetly getting better at controlling our temper already we now you are going to be doing some lines for me mr potter no not with your quill she added as harry bent down to open his bag going to be using a rather special one of mine here you are 
 
 she handed him a long thin black quill with an unusually sharp point 
 
 i want you to write i must not tell lies she told him softly 
 
 how many times harry asked with a creditable imitation of politeness 
 
 oh as long as it takes for the message to sink in said umbridge sweetly off you go 
 
 she moved over to her desk sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking harry raised the sharp black quill then realised what was missing 
 
 you given me any ink he said 
 
 oh you need ink said professor umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice 
 
 harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote i must not tell lies 
 
 he let out a gasp of pain the words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink at the same time the words had appeared on the back of right hand cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel yet even as he stared at the shining cut the skin healed over again leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth 
 
 harry looked round at umbridge she was watching him her wide toadlike mouth stretched in a smile 
 
 yes 
 
 nothing said harry quietly 
 
 he looked back at the parchment placed the quill on it once more wrote i must not tell lies and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time once again the words had been cut into his skin once again they healed over seconds later 
 
 and on it went again and again harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink but his own blood and again and again the words were cut into the back of his hand healed and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment 
 
 darkness fell outside window harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop he did not even check his watch he knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any not even if he had to sit there all night cutting open his own hand with this quill 
 
 come here she said after what seemed hours 
 
 he stood up his hand was stinging painfully when he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed but that the skin there was red raw 
 
 hand she said 
 
 he extended it she took it in her own harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings 
 
 tut tut i seem to have made much of an impression yet she said smiling well just have to try again tomorrow evening we you may go 
 
 harry left her office without a word the school was quite deserted it was surely past midnight he walked slowly up the corridor then when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him broke into a run 
 
 he had not had time to practise vanishing spells had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle nor had he written his essays he skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of dreams for divination their first lesson and was surprised to find a dishevelled ron keeping him company 
 
 how come you do it last night harry asked as ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration ron who had been fast asleep when harry got back to the dormitory muttered something about doing other stuff bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words 
 
 have to do he said slamming the diary shut said i dreamed i was buying a new pair of shoes she make anything weird out of that can she 
 
 they hurried off to north tower together 
 
 how was detention with umbridge anyway what did she make you do 
 
 harry hesitated for a fraction of a second then said lines 
 
 not too bad then eh said ron 
 
 nope said harry 
 
 heyi forgot did she let you off for friday 
 
 no said harry 
 
 ron groaned sympathetically 
 
 it was another bad day for harry he was one of the worst in transfiguration not having practised vanishing spells at all he had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle and meanwhile professors mcgonagall and sinistra gave them yet more homework which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with umbridge to cap it all angelina johnson tracked him down at dinner again and on learning that he would not be able to attend keeper tryouts told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments 
 
 in detention harry yelled after her as she stalked away think rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing quidditch 
 
 at least only lines said hermione consolingly as harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie which he no longer fancied very much not as it a dreadful punishment really 
 
 harry opened his mouth closed it again and nodded he was not really sure why he was not telling ron and hermione exactly what was happening in room he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face he also felt dimly that this was between himself and umbridge a private battle of wills and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it 
 
 i believe how much homework got said ron miserably 
 
 well why you do any last night hermione asked him where were you anyway 
 
 i was i fancied a walk said ron shiftily 
 
 harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment 
 
 the second detention was just as bad as the previous one the skin on the back of hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and umbridge would perhaps be satisfied he let no gasp of pain escape him however and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal again past midnight he said nothing but good evening and goodnight 
 
 his homework situation however was now desperate and when he returned to the gryffindor common room he did not though exhausted go to bed but opened his books and began moonstone essay it was half past two by the time he had finished it he knew he had done a poor job but there was no help for it unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with snape next he then dashed off answers to the questions professor mcgonagall had set them cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for professor and staggered up to bed where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately 
 
 thursday passed in a haze of tiredness ron seemed very sleepy too though harry could not see why he should be third detention passed in the same way as the previous two except that after two hours the words i must not tell lies did not fade from the back of hand but remained scratched there oozing droplets of blood the pause in the pointed quills scratching made professor umbridge look up 
 
 ah she said softly moving around her desk to examine his hand herself good that ought to serve as a reminder to you it you may leave for tonight 
 
 do i still have to come back tomorrow said harry picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one 
 
 oh yes said professor umbridge smiling as widely as before yes i think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evenings work 
 
 harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than snape but as he walked back towards gryffindor tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender evil he thought as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor an evil twisted mad old 
 
 ron 
 
 he had reached the top of the stairs turned right and almost walked into ron who was lurking behind a statue of lachlan the lanky clutching his broomstick he gave a great leap of surprise when he saw harry and attempted to hide his new cleansweep eleven behind his back 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 ernothing what are you doing 
 
 harry frowned at him 
 
 come on you can tell me what are you hiding here for 
 
 hiding from fred and george if you must know said ron they just went past with a bunch of i bet testing stuff on them again i mean they do it in the common room now can they not with hermione there 
 
 he was talking in a very fast feverish way 
 
 but what have you got your broom for you been flying have you harry asked 
 
 iwellwell ok tell you but laugh all right ron said defensively turning redder with every second ii thought try out for gryffindor keeper now got a decent broom there go on laugh 
 
 not laughing said harry ron blinked a brilliant idea be really cool if you got on the team never seen you play keeper are you good 
 
 not bad said ron who looked immensely relieved at reaction charlie fred and george always made me keep for them when they were training during the holidays 
 
 so been practising tonight 
 
 every evening since tuesday just on my own though been trying to bewitch quaffles to fly at me but it been easy and i know how much use be ron looked nervous and anxious fred and george are going to laugh themselves stupid when i turn up for the tryouts they stopped taking the mickey out of me since i got made a prefect 
 
 i wish i was going to be there said harry bitterly as they set off together towards the common room 
 
 yeah so do harry that on the back of your hand 
 
 harry who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand tried to hide it but had as much success as ron with his cleansweep 
 
 just a cut 
 
 but ron had grabbed forearm and pulled the back of hand up level with his eyes there was a pause during which he stared at the words carved into the skin then looking sick he released harry 
 
 i thought you said she was just giving you lines 
 
 harry hesitated but after all ron had been honest with him so he told ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in office 
 
 the old hag ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the fat lady who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame sick go to mcgonagall say something 
 
 no said harry at once not giving her the satisfaction of knowing got to me 
 
 got to let her get away with this 
 
 i know how much power got over her said harry 
 
 dumbledore then tell dumbledore 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 why not 
 
 got enough on his mind said harry but that was not the true reason he was not going to go to dumbledore for help when dumbledore had not spoken to him once since june 
 
 well i reckon you should ron began but he was interrupted by the fat lady who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out are you going to give me the password or will i have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation 
 
 friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week though harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the great hall it was without any real hope of seeing hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with umbridge 
 
 two things sustained harry that day one was the thought that it was almost the weekend the other was that dreadful though his final detention with umbridge was sure to be he had a distant view of the quidditch pitch from her window and might with luck be able to see something of tryout these were rather feeble rays of light it was true but harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness he had never had a worse first week of term at hogwarts 
 
 at five that evening he knocked on professor office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time and was told to enter the blank parchment lay ready for him on the table the pointed black quill beside it 
 
 you know what to do mr potter said umbridge smiling sweetly at him 
 
 harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window if he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it he now had a distant view of the gryffindor quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts apparently awaiting their turn to keep it was impossible to tell which one was ron at this distance 
 
 i must not tell wrote the cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh 
 
 i must not tell cut dug deeper stinging and smarting 
 
 i must not tell trickled down his wrist 
 
 he chanced another glance out of the window whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed katie bell scored twice in the few seconds harry dared to watch hoping very much that the keeper ron he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 he looked up whenever he thought he could risk it when he could hear the scratching of quill or the opening of a desk drawer the third person to try out was pretty good the fourth was terrible the fifth dodged a bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save the sky was darkening and harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 the parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand which was searing with pain when he next looked up night had fallen and the quidditch pitch was no longer visible 
 
 see if got the message yet shall we said soft voice half an hour later 
 
 she moved towards him stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm and then as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin pain seared not across the back of his hand but across the scar on his forehead at the same time he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff 
 
 he wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet staring at her she looked back at him a smile stretching her wide slack mouth 
 
 yes it hurts it she said softly 
 
 he did not answer his heart was thumping very hard and fast was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead 
 
 well i think made my point mr potter you may go 
 
 he caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could 
 
 stay calm he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs stay calm it necessarily mean what you think it means 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he gasped at the fat lady who swung forwards once more 
 
 a roar of sound greeted him ron came running towards him beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching 
 
 harry i did it in keeper 
 
 what oh brilliant said harry trying to smile naturally while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled 
 
 have a butterbeer ron pressed a bottle on him i believe hermione gone 
 
 there said fred who was also swigging butterbeer and pointed to an armchair by the fire hermione was dozing in it her drink tipping precariously in her hand 
 
 well she said she was pleased when i told her said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 let her sleep said george hastily it was a few moments before harry noticed that several of the gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds 
 
 come here ron and see if old robes fit you called kade bell we can take off his name and put yours on instead 
 
 as ron moved away angelina came striding up to harry 
 
 sorry i was a bit short with you earlier potter she said abruptly stressful this managing lark you know starting to think i was a bit hard on wood sometimes she was watching ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face 
 
 look i know your best mate but not fabulous she said bluntly i think with a bit of training be all right though he comes from a family of good quidditch players banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today to be honest vicky frobisher and geoffrey hooper both flew better this evening but a real whiner always moaning about something or other and involved in all sorts of societies she admitted herself that if training clashed with her charms club put charms first anyway having a practice session at two tomorrow so just make sure there this time and do me a favour and help ron as much as you can ok 
 
 he nodded and angelina strolled back to alicia spinnet harry moved over to sit next to hermione who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag 
 
 oh harry you good about ron it she said blearily just sososo tired she yawned i was up until one making more hats disappearing like mad 
 
 and sure enough now that he looked harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up 
 
 great said harry distractedly if he did not tell somebody soon he would burst listen hermione i was just up in office and she touched my arm 
 
 hermione listened closely when harry had finished she said slowly worried controlling her like he controlled quirrell 
 
 well said harry dropping his voice a possibility it 
 
 i suppose so said hermione though she sounded unconvinced but i think he can be possessing her the way he possessed quirrell i mean properly alive again now he got his own body he need to share someone he could have her under the imperius curse i suppose 
 
 harry watched fred george and lee jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment then hermione said but last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you and dumbledore say it had to do with what was feeling at the time i mean maybe this got anything to do with umbridge at all maybe just coincidence it happened while you were with her 
 
 evil said harry flatly twisted 
 
 horrible yes but harry i think you ought to tell dumbledore your scar hurt 
 
 it was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to dumbledore and his answer to hermione was just the same as his answer to ron 
 
 not bothering him with this like you just said not a big deal been hurting on and off all summerit was just a bit worse tonight all 
 
 harry sure dumbledore would want to be bothered by this 
 
 yeah said harry before he could stop himself the only bit of me dumbledore cares about it my scar 
 
 say that not true 
 
 i think write and tell sirius about it see what he thinks 
 
 harry you put something like that in a letter said hermione looking alarmed you remember moody told us to be careful what we put in writing we just guarantee owls being intercepted any more 
 
 all right all right i tell him then said harry irritably he got to his feet going to bed tell ron for me will you 
 
 oh no said hermione looking relieved if going that means i can go too without being rude absolutely exhausted and i want to make some more hats tomorrow listen you can help me if you like quite fun getting better i can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now 
 
 harry looked into her face which was shining with glee and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer 
 
 er no i think i will thanks he said ernot tomorrow got loads of homework to do 
 
 and he traipsed off to the boys stairs leaving her looking slightly disappointed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen dentention with delorescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dinner in the great hall that night was not a pleasant experience for harry the news about his shouting match with umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by hogwarts standards he heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between ron and hermione the funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him on the contrary it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again so that they could hear his story 
 
 he says he saw cedric diggory murdered 
 
 he reckons he duelled with 
 
 come off it 
 
 who does he think kidding 
 
 
 
 what i get said harry through clenched teeth laying down his knife and fork his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady is why they all believed the story two months ago when dumbledore told them 
 
 the thing is harry not sure they did said hermione grimly oh get out of here 
 
 she slammed down her own knife and fork ron looked longingly at his apple pie but followed suit people stared at them all the way out of the hall 
 
 what mean not sure they believed dumbledore harry asked hermione when they reached the landing 
 
 look you understand what it was like after it happened said hermione quietly you arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching dead body none of us saw what what happened in the maze we just had word for it that had come back and killed cedric and fought you 
 
 which is the truth said harry loudly 
 
 i know it is harry so will you please stop biting my head off said hermione wearily just that before the truth could sink in everyone went home for the summer where they spent two months reading about how a nutcase and going senile 
 
 rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to gryffindor tower harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed a dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye he glanced out of a window at the dark grounds as they turned into the fat corridor there was still no light in cabin 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia said hermione before the fat lady could ask the portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it 
 
 the common room was almost empty nearly everyone was still down at dinner crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them purring loudly and when harry ron and hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion harry gazed into the flames feeling drained and exhausted 
 
 how can dumbledore have let this happen hermione cried suddenly making harry and ron jump crookshanks leapt off her looking affronted she pounded the arms of her chair in fury so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes how can he let that terrible woman teach us and in our owl year too 
 
 well never had great defence against the dark arts teachers have we said harry you know what like hagrid told us nobody wants the job they say jinxed 
 
 yes but to employ someone actually refusing to let us do magic dumbledore playing at 
 
 and trying to get people to spy for her said ron darkly 
 
 remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying back 
 
 of course here to spy on us all obvious why else would fudge have wanted her to come snapped hermione 
 
 start arguing again said harry wearily as ron opened his mouth to retaliate we just just do that homework get it out of the way 
 
 they collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire people were coming back from dinner now harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole but could still sense the stares he was attracting 
 
 shall we do stuff first said ron dipping his quill into his ink the properties of moonstone and its uses in he muttered writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them there he underlined the title then looked up expectantly at hermione 
 
 so what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in 
 
 but hermione was not listening she was squinting over into the far corner of the room where fred george and lee jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that fred was holding 
 
 no sorry gone too far she said standing up and looking positively furious come on ron 
 
 i what said ron plainly playing for time nocome on hermionewe tell them off for giving out sweets 
 
 you know perfectly well that those are bits of nosebleed nougat oror puking pastilles or 
 
 fainting fancies harry suggested quietly 
 
 one by one as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet the were slumping unconscious in their seats some slid right on to the floor others merely hung over the arms of their chairs their tongues lolling out most of the people watching were laughing hermione however squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where fred and george now stood with clipboards closely observing the unconscious ron rose halfway out of his chair hovered uncertainly for a moment or two then muttered to harry got it under control before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted 
 
 enough hermione said forcefully to fred and george both of whom looked up in mild surprise 
 
 yeah right said george nodding this dosage looks strong enough it 
 
 i told you this morning you test your rubbish on students 
 
 paying them said fred indignantly 
 
 i care it could be dangerous 
 
 rubbish said fred 
 
 calm down hermione fine said lee reassuringly as he walked from to inserting purple sweets into their open mouths 
 
 yeah look coming round now said george 
 
 a few of the were indeed stirring several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor or dangling off their chairs that harry was sure fred and george had not warned them what the sweets were going to do 
 
 feel all right said george kindly to a small girl lying at his feet 
 
 ii think so she said shakily 
 
 excellent said fred happily but the next second hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of fainting fancies from his hands 
 
 it is not excellent 
 
 course it is alive they said fred angrily 
 
 you do this what if you made one of them really ill 
 
 not going to make them ill already tested them all on ourselves this is just to see if everyone reacts the same 
 
 if you stop doing it going to 
 
 put us in detention said fred in an voice 
 
 make us write lines said george smirking 
 
 onlookers all over the room were laughing hermione drew herself up to her full height her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity 
 
 no she said her voice quivering with anger but i will write to your mother 
 
 you said george horrified taking a step back from her 
 
 oh yes i would said hermione grimly i stop you eating the stupid things yourselves but not to give them to the 
 
 fred and george looked thunderstruck it was clear that as far as they were concerned threat was way below the belt with a last threatening look at them she thrust clipboard and the bag of fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire 
 
 ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees 
 
 thank you for your support ron hermione said acidly 
 
 you handled it fine by yourself ron mumbled 
 
 hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds then said edgily oh no good i concentrate now going to bed 
 
 she wrenched her bag open harry thought she was about to put her books away but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace covered them with a few bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect 
 
 what in the name of merlin are you doing said ron watching her as though fearful for her sanity 
 
 hats for she said briskly now stuffing her books back into her bag i did them over the summer a really slow knitter without magic but now back at school i should be able to make lots more 
 
 leaving out hats for the said ron slowly and covering them up with rubbish first 
 
 yes said hermione defiantly swinging her bag on to her back 
 
 not on said ron angrily trying to trick them into picking up the hats setting them free when they might not want to be free 
 
 of course they want to be free said hermione at once though her face was turning pink you dare touch those hats ron 
 
 she turned on her heel and left ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls dormitories then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats 
 
 they should at least see what picking up he said firmly anyway he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of essay no point trying to finish this now i do it without hermione i got a clue what supposed to do with moonstones have you 
 
 harry shook his head noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse he thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply knowing perfectly well that when the morning came he would regret not finishing his homework that night he piled his books back into his bag 
 
 going to bed too 
 
 he passed seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories but did not look at him harry had a fleeting impression that seamus had opened his mouth to speak but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation 
 
 the following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast 
 
 but on the plus side no snape today said ron bracingly 
 
 hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee she looked mildly pleased about something and when ron asked her what she had to be so happy about she simply said the hats have gone seems the do want freedom after all 
 
 i bet on it ron told her cuttingly they might not count as clothes they look anything like hats to me more like woolly bladders 
 
 hermione did not speak to him all morning 
 
 double charms was succeeded by double transfiguration professor flitwick and professor mcgonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of owls 
 
 what you must remember said little professor flitwick squeakily perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come if you have not already given serious thought to your careers now is the time to do so and in the meantime afraid we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice 
 
 they then spent over an hour revising summoning charms which according to professor flitwick were bound to come up in their owl and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of charms homework 
 
 it was the same if not worse in transfiguration 
 
 you cannot pass an owl said professor mcgonagall grimly without serious application practice and study i see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an owl in transfiguration as long as they put in the work neville made a sad little disbelieving noise yes you too longbottom said professor mcgonagall nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence so today we are starting vanishing spells these are easier than conjuring spells which you would not usually attempt until newt level but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your owl 
 
 she was quite right harry found the vanishing spells horribly difficult by the end of a double period neither he nor ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising though ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler hermione on the other hand successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt earning her a bonus for gryffindor from professor mcgonagall she was the only person not given homework everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon 
 
 now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do harry and ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in still angry about slur on her woolly hats hermione did not join them by the time they reached care of magical creatures in the afternoon head was aching again 
 
 the day had become cool and breezy and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces professor stood waiting for the class some ten yards from front door a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs as harry and ron reached her a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them turning they saw draco malfoy striding towards them surrounded by his usual gang of slytherin cronies he had clearly just said something highly amusing because crabbe goyle pansy parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and judging by the way they all kept looking over at harry he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty 
 
 everyone here barked professor once all the slytherins and gryffindors had arrived crack on then who can tell me what these things are called 
 
 she indicated the heap of twigs in front of her hand shot into the air behind her back malfoy did a imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question pansy parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny creatures made of wood each with knobbly brown arms and legs two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat barklike face in which a pair of eyes glittered 
 
 oooooh said parvati and lavender thoroughly irritating harry anyone would have thought hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough and the skrewts perhaps too much so 
 
 kindly keep your voices down girls said professor sharply scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the who immediately fell upon the food soanyone know the names of these creatures miss granger 
 
 bowtruckles said hermione usually live in 
 
 five points for gryffindor said professor yes these are bowtruckles and as miss granger rightly says they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality anybody know what they eat 
 
 woodlice said hermione promptly which explained why what harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving but fairy eggs if they can get them 
 
 good girl take another five points so whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it they may not look dangerous but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers which as you can see are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs so if like to gather closer take a few woodlice and a bowtrucklei have enough here for one between threeyou can study them more closely i want a sketch from each of you with all labelled by the end of the lesson 
 
 the class surged forwards around the trestle table harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to professor 
 
 hagrid he asked her while everyone else was choosing bowtruckles 
 
 never you mind said professor repressively which had been her attitude last time hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too smirking all over his pointed face draco malfoy leaned across harry and seized the largest bowtruckle 
 
 maybe said malfoy in an undertone so that only harry could hear him the stupid great got himself badly injured 
 
 maybe you will if you shut up said harry out of the side of his mouth 
 
 maybe been messing with stuff too big for him if you get my drift 
 
 malfoy walked away smirking over his shoulder at harry who felt suddenly sick did malfoy know something his father was a death eater after all what if he had information about fate that had not yet reached the ears of the order he hurried back around the table to ron and hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it harry pulled out parchment and quill crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what malfoy had just said 
 
 dumbledore would know if something had happened to hagrid said hermione at once just playing into hands to look worried it tells him we know exactly going on got to ignore him harry here hold the bowtruckle for a moment just so i can draw its face 
 
 yes came clear drawl from the group nearest them father was talking to the minister just a couple of days ago you know and it sounds as though the really determined to crack down on teaching in this place so even if that overgrown moron does show up again probably be sent packing straightaway 
 
 ouch 
 
 harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers leaving two long deep cuts there harry dropped it crabbe and goyle who had already been guffawing at the idea of hagrid being sacked laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the forest a little moving soon swallowed up among the tree roots when the bell echoed distantly over the grounds harry rolled up his bowtruckle picture and marched off to herbology with his hand wrapped in handkerchief and derisive laughter still ringing in his ears 
 
 if he calls hagrid a moron one more time said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 harry go picking a row with malfoy forget a prefect now he could make life difficult for you 
 
 wow i wonder what be like to have a difficult life said harry sarcastically ron laughed but hermione frowned together they traipsed across the vegetable patch the sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not 
 
 i just wish hagrid would hurry up and get back all said harry in a low voice as they reached the greenhouses and say that a better teacher he added threateningly 
 
 i going to said hermione calmly 
 
 because never be as good as hagrid said harry firmly fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary care of magical creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it 
 
 the door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some spilled out of it including ginny 
 
 hi she said brightly as she passed a few seconds later luna lovegood emerged trailing behind the rest of the class a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head when she saw harry her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him many of his classmates turned curiously to watch luna took a great breath and then said without so much as a preliminary hello i believe he who must not be named is back and i believe you fought him and escaped from him 
 
 erright said harry awkwardly luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings a fact that parvati and lavender seemed to have noticed as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes 
 
 you can laugh luna said her voice rising apparently under the impression that parvati and lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing but people used to believe there were no such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 well they were right they said hermione impatiently there any such things as the blibbering humdinger or the snorkack 
 
 luna gave her a withering look and flounced away radishes swinging madly parvati and lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now 
 
 mind not offending the only people who believe me harry asked hermione as they made their way into class 
 
 oh for sake harry you can do better than her said hermione told me all about her apparently only believe in things as long as no proof at all well i expect anything else from someone whose father runs the quibbler 
 
 harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how luna had said she could see them too his spirits sank slightly had she been lying but before he could devote much more thought to the matter ernie macmillan had stepped up to him 
 
 i want you to know potter he said in a loud carrying voice that not only weirdos who support you i personally believe you one hundred per cent my family have always stood firm behind dumbledore and so do i 
 
 erthanks very much ernie said harry taken aback but pleased ernie might be pompous on occasions like this but harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears words had certainly wiped the smile from lavender browns face and as he turned to talk to ron and hermione harry caught expression which looked both confused and defiant 
 
 to surprise professor sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of owls harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this he was starting to get an anxious twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do a feeling that worsened dramatically when professor sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung professor sprouts preferred type of fertiliser the gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later none of them talking very much it had been another long day 
 
 as harry was starving and he had his first detention with umbridge at five he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in gryffindor tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him he had barely reached the entrance of the great hall however when a loud and angry voice yelled oi potter 
 
 what now he muttered wearily turning to face angelina johnson who looked as though she was in a towering temper 
 
 tell you what now she said marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger how come landed yourself in detention for five on friday 
 
 what said harry why oh yeah keeper tryouts 
 
 now he remembers snarled angelina i tell you i wanted to do a tryout with the whole team and find someone who fitted in with i tell you booked the quidditch pitch specially and now decided not going to be there 
 
 i decide not to be there said harry stung by the injustice of these words i got detention from that umbridge woman just because i told her the truth about 
 
 well you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en friday said angelina fiercely and i care how you do it tell her a figment of your imagination if you like just make sure there 
 
 she turned on her heel and stormed away 
 
 you know what harry said to ron and hermione as they entered the great hall i think better check with puddlemere united whether oliver been killed during a training session because angelina seems to be channelling his spirit 
 
 what reckon are the odds of umbridge letting you off on friday said ron sceptically as they sat down at the gryffindor table 
 
 less than zero said harry glumly tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat better try though i offer to do two more detentions or something i dunno he swallowed a mouthful of potato and added i hope she keep me too long this evening you realise got to write three essays practise vanishing spells for mcgonagall work out a for flitwick finish the bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for trelawney 
 
 ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling 
 
 and it looks like going to rain 
 
 that got to do with our homework said hermione her eyebrows raised 
 
 nothing said ron at once his ears reddening 
 
 at five to five harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for office on the third floor when he knocked on the door she called come in in a sugary voice he entered cautiously looking around 
 
 he had known this office under three of its previous occupants 
 
 in the days when gilderoy lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself when lupin had occupied it it was likely you would meet some fascinating dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call in the impostor days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment 
 
 now however it looked totally unrecognisable the surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths there were several vases full of dried flowers each one residing on its own doily and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck these were so foul that harry stared at them transfixed until professor umbridge spoke again 
 
 good evening mr potter 
 
 harry started and looked around he had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her 
 
 evening professor umbridge harry said stiffly 
 
 well sit down she said pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a chair a piece of blank parchment lay on the table apparently waiting for him 
 
 er said harry without moving professor umbridge erbefore we start ii wanted to ask you a a favour 
 
 her bulging eyes narrowed 
 
 oh yes 
 
 well in the gryffindor quidditch team and i was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new keeper at five on friday and i waswas wondering whether i could skip detention that night and do itdo it another night instead 
 
 he knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good 
 
 oh no said umbridge smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly oh no no no this is your punishment for spreading evil nasty stories mr potter and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty convenience no you will come here at five tomorrow and the next day and on friday too and you will do your detentions as planned i think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do it ought to reinforce the lesson i am trying to teach you 
 
 harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears so he told evil nasty stones did he 
 
 she was watching him with her head slightly to one side still smiling widely as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again with a massive effort harry looked away from her dropped his schoolbag beside the chair and sat down 
 
 there said umbridge sweetly getting better at controlling our temper already we now you are going to be doing some lines for me mr potter no not with your quill she added as harry bent down to open his bag going to be using a rather special one of mine here you are 
 
 she handed him a long thin black quill with an unusually sharp point 
 
 i want you to write i must not tell lies she told him softly 
 
 how many times harry asked with a creditable imitation of politeness 
 
 oh as long as it takes for the message to sink in said umbridge sweetly off you go 
 
 she moved over to her desk sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking harry raised the sharp black quill then realised what was missing 
 
 you given me any ink he said 
 
 oh you need ink said professor umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice 
 
 harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote i must not tell lies 
 
 he let out a gasp of pain the words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink at the same time the words had appeared on the back of right hand cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel yet even as he stared at the shining cut the skin healed over again leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth 
 
 harry looked round at umbridge she was watching him her wide toadlike mouth stretched in a smile 
 
 yes 
 
 nothing said harry quietly 
 
 he looked back at the parchment placed the quill on it once more wrote i must not tell lies and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time once again the words had been cut into his skin once again they healed over seconds later 
 
 and on it went again and again harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink but his own blood and again and again the words were cut into the back of his hand healed and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment 
 
 darkness fell outside window harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop he did not even check his watch he knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any not even if he had to sit there all night cutting open his own hand with this quill 
 
 come here she said after what seemed hours 
 
 he stood up his hand was stinging painfully when he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed but that the skin there was red raw 
 
 hand she said 
 
 he extended it she took it in her own harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings 
 
 tut tut i seem to have made much of an impression yet she said smiling well just have to try again tomorrow evening we you may go 
 
 harry left her office without a word the school was quite deserted it was surely past midnight he walked slowly up the corridor then when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him broke into a run 
 
 he had not had time to practise vanishing spells had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle nor had he written his essays he skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of dreams for divination their first lesson and was surprised to find a dishevelled ron keeping him company 
 
 how come you do it last night harry asked as ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration ron who had been fast asleep when harry got back to the dormitory muttered something about doing other stuff bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words 
 
 have to do he said slamming the diary shut said i dreamed i was buying a new pair of shoes she make anything weird out of that can she 
 
 they hurried off to north tower together 
 
 how was detention with umbridge anyway what did she make you do 
 
 harry hesitated for a fraction of a second then said lines 
 
 not too bad then eh said ron 
 
 nope said harry 
 
 heyi forgot did she let you off for friday 
 
 no said harry 
 
 ron groaned sympathetically 
 
 it was another bad day for harry he was one of the worst in transfiguration not having practised vanishing spells at all he had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle and meanwhile professors mcgonagall and sinistra gave them yet more homework which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with umbridge to cap it all angelina johnson tracked him down at dinner again and on learning that he would not be able to attend keeper tryouts told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments 
 
 in detention harry yelled after her as she stalked away think rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing quidditch 
 
 at least only lines said hermione consolingly as harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie which he no longer fancied very much not as it a dreadful punishment really 
 
 harry opened his mouth closed it again and nodded he was not really sure why he was not telling ron and hermione exactly what was happening in room he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face he also felt dimly that this was between himself and umbridge a private battle of wills and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it 
 
 i believe how much homework got said ron miserably 
 
 well why you do any last night hermione asked him where were you anyway 
 
 i was i fancied a walk said ron shiftily 
 
 harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment 
 
 the second detention was just as bad as the previous one the skin on the back of hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and umbridge would perhaps be satisfied he let no gasp of pain escape him however and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal again past midnight he said nothing but good evening and goodnight 
 
 his homework situation however was now desperate and when he returned to the gryffindor common room he did not though exhausted go to bed but opened his books and began moonstone essay it was half past two by the time he had finished it he knew he had done a poor job but there was no help for it unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with snape next he then dashed off answers to the questions professor mcgonagall had set them cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for professor and staggered up to bed where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately 
 
 thursday passed in a haze of tiredness ron seemed very sleepy too though harry could not see why he should be third detention passed in the same way as the previous two except that after two hours the words i must not tell lies did not fade from the back of hand but remained scratched there oozing droplets of blood the pause in the pointed quills scratching made professor umbridge look up 
 
 ah she said softly moving around her desk to examine his hand herself good that ought to serve as a reminder to you it you may leave for tonight 
 
 do i still have to come back tomorrow said harry picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one 
 
 oh yes said professor umbridge smiling as widely as before yes i think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evenings work 
 
 harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than snape but as he walked back towards gryffindor tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender evil he thought as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor an evil twisted mad old 
 
 ron 
 
 he had reached the top of the stairs turned right and almost walked into ron who was lurking behind a statue of lachlan the lanky clutching his broomstick he gave a great leap of surprise when he saw harry and attempted to hide his new cleansweep eleven behind his back 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 ernothing what are you doing 
 
 harry frowned at him 
 
 come on you can tell me what are you hiding here for 
 
 hiding from fred and george if you must know said ron they just went past with a bunch of i bet testing stuff on them again i mean they do it in the common room now can they not with hermione there 
 
 he was talking in a very fast feverish way 
 
 but what have you got your broom for you been flying have you harry asked 
 
 iwellwell ok tell you but laugh all right ron said defensively turning redder with every second ii thought try out for gryffindor keeper now got a decent broom there go on laugh 
 
 not laughing said harry ron blinked a brilliant idea be really cool if you got on the team never seen you play keeper are you good 
 
 not bad said ron who looked immensely relieved at reaction charlie fred and george always made me keep for them when they were training during the holidays 
 
 so been practising tonight 
 
 every evening since tuesday just on my own though been trying to bewitch quaffles to fly at me but it been easy and i know how much use be ron looked nervous and anxious fred and george are going to laugh themselves stupid when i turn up for the tryouts they stopped taking the mickey out of me since i got made a prefect 
 
 i wish i was going to be there said harry bitterly as they set off together towards the common room 
 
 yeah so do harry that on the back of your hand 
 
 harry who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand tried to hide it but had as much success as ron with his cleansweep 
 
 just a cut 
 
 but ron had grabbed forearm and pulled the back of hand up level with his eyes there was a pause during which he stared at the words carved into the skin then looking sick he released harry 
 
 i thought you said she was just giving you lines 
 
 harry hesitated but after all ron had been honest with him so he told ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in office 
 
 the old hag ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the fat lady who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame sick go to mcgonagall say something 
 
 no said harry at once not giving her the satisfaction of knowing got to me 
 
 got to let her get away with this 
 
 i know how much power got over her said harry 
 
 dumbledore then tell dumbledore 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 why not 
 
 got enough on his mind said harry but that was not the true reason he was not going to go to dumbledore for help when dumbledore had not spoken to him once since june 
 
 well i reckon you should ron began but he was interrupted by the fat lady who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out are you going to give me the password or will i have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation 
 
 friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week though harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the great hall it was without any real hope of seeing hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with umbridge 
 
 two things sustained harry that day one was the thought that it was almost the weekend the other was that dreadful though his final detention with umbridge was sure to be he had a distant view of the quidditch pitch from her window and might with luck be able to see something of tryout these were rather feeble rays of light it was true but harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness he had never had a worse first week of term at hogwarts 
 
 at five that evening he knocked on professor office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time and was told to enter the blank parchment lay ready for him on the table the pointed black quill beside it 
 
 you know what to do mr potter said umbridge smiling sweetly at him 
 
 harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window if he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it he now had a distant view of the gryffindor quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts apparently awaiting their turn to keep it was impossible to tell which one was ron at this distance 
 
 i must not tell wrote the cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh 
 
 i must not tell cut dug deeper stinging and smarting 
 
 i must not tell trickled down his wrist 
 
 he chanced another glance out of the window whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed katie bell scored twice in the few seconds harry dared to watch hoping very much that the keeper ron he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 he looked up whenever he thought he could risk it when he could hear the scratching of quill or the opening of a desk drawer the third person to try out was pretty good the fourth was terrible the fifth dodged a bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save the sky was darkening and harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 i must not tell lies 
 
 the parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand which was searing with pain when he next looked up night had fallen and the quidditch pitch was no longer visible 
 
 see if got the message yet shall we said soft voice half an hour later 
 
 she moved towards him stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm and then as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin pain seared not across the back of his hand but across the scar on his forehead at the same time he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff 
 
 he wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet staring at her she looked back at him a smile stretching her wide slack mouth 
 
 yes it hurts it she said softly 
 
 he did not answer his heart was thumping very hard and fast was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead 
 
 well i think made my point mr potter you may go 
 
 he caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could 
 
 stay calm he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs stay calm it necessarily mean what you think it means 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he gasped at the fat lady who swung forwards once more 
 
 a roar of sound greeted him ron came running towards him beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching 
 
 harry i did it in keeper 
 
 what oh brilliant said harry trying to smile naturally while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled 
 
 have a butterbeer ron pressed a bottle on him i believe hermione gone 
 
 there said fred who was also swigging butterbeer and pointed to an armchair by the fire hermione was dozing in it her drink tipping precariously in her hand 
 
 well she said she was pleased when i told her said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 let her sleep said george hastily it was a few moments before harry noticed that several of the gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds 
 
 come here ron and see if old robes fit you called kade bell we can take off his name and put yours on instead 
 
 as ron moved away angelina came striding up to harry 
 
 sorry i was a bit short with you earlier potter she said abruptly stressful this managing lark you know starting to think i was a bit hard on wood sometimes she was watching ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face 
 
 look i know your best mate but not fabulous she said bluntly i think with a bit of training be all right though he comes from a family of good quidditch players banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today to be honest vicky frobisher and geoffrey hooper both flew better this evening but a real whiner always moaning about something or other and involved in all sorts of societies she admitted herself that if training clashed with her charms club put charms first anyway having a practice session at two tomorrow so just make sure there this time and do me a favour and help ron as much as you can ok 
 
 he nodded and angelina strolled back to alicia spinnet harry moved over to sit next to hermione who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag 
 
 oh harry you good about ron it she said blearily just sososo tired she yawned i was up until one making more hats disappearing like mad 
 
 and sure enough now that he looked harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up 
 
 great said harry distractedly if he did not tell somebody soon he would burst listen hermione i was just up in office and she touched my arm 
 
 hermione listened closely when harry had finished she said slowly worried controlling her like he controlled quirrell 
 
 well said harry dropping his voice a possibility it 
 
 i suppose so said hermione though she sounded unconvinced but i think he can be possessing her the way he possessed quirrell i mean properly alive again now he got his own body he need to share someone he could have her under the imperius curse i suppose 
 
 harry watched fred george and lee jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment then hermione said but last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you and dumbledore say it had to do with what was feeling at the time i mean maybe this got anything to do with umbridge at all maybe just coincidence it happened while you were with her 
 
 evil said harry flatly twisted 
 
 horrible yes but harry i think you ought to tell dumbledore your scar hurt 
 
 it was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to dumbledore and his answer to hermione was just the same as his answer to ron 
 
 not bothering him with this like you just said not a big deal been hurting on and off all summerit was just a bit worse tonight all 
 
 harry sure dumbledore would want to be bothered by this 
 
 yeah said harry before he could stop himself the only bit of me dumbledore cares about it my scar 
 
 say that not true 
 
 i think write and tell sirius about it see what he thinks 
 
 harry you put something like that in a letter said hermione looking alarmed you remember moody told us to be careful what we put in writing we just guarantee owls being intercepted any more 
 
 all right all right i tell him then said harry irritably he got to his feet going to bed tell ron for me will you 
 
 oh no said hermione looking relieved if going that means i can go too without being rude absolutely exhausted and i want to make some more hats tomorrow listen you can help me if you like quite fun getting better i can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now 
 
 harry looked into her face which was shining with glee and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer 
 
 er no i think i will thanks he said ernot tomorrow got loads of homework to do 
 
 and he traipsed off to the boys stairs leaving her looking slightly disappointed 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the secret riddlecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 katie was removed to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries the following day by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school though the details were confused and nobody other than harry ron hermione and leanne seemed to know that katie herself had not been the intended target 
 
 oh and malfoy knows of course said harry to ron and hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever harry mentioned his theory 
 
 harry had wondered whether dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for monday lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside office at eight knocked and was told to enter there sat dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand was as black and burned as ever but he smiled when he gestured to harry to sit down the pensieve was sitting on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling 
 
 you have had a busy time while i have been away dumbledore said i believe you witnessed accident 
 
 yes sir how is she 
 
 still very unwell although she was relatively lucky she appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin there was a tiny hole in her glove had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly luckily professor snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse 
 
 why him asked harry quickly why not madam pomfrey 
 
 impertinent said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall and phineas nigellus black raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping i would not have permitted a student to question the way hogwarts operated in my day 
 
 yes thank you phineas said dumbledore quellingly professor snape knows much more about the dark arts than madam pomfrey harry anyway the st staff are sending me hourly reports and i am hopeful that katie will make a full recovery in time 
 
 where were you this weekend sir harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by phineas nigellus who hissed softly 
 
 i would rather not say just now said dumbledore however i shall tell you in due course 
 
 you will said harry startled 
 
 yes i expect so said dumbledore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand 
 
 sir said harry tentatively i met mundungus in hogsmeade 
 
 ah yes i am already aware that mundungus has been treating your inheritance with contempt said dumbledore frowning a little he has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the three broomsticks i rather think he dreads facing me however rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of old possessions 
 
 that mangy old has been stealing black heirlooms said phineas nigellus incensed and he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 professor said harry after a short pause did professor mcgonagall tell you what i told her after katie got hurt about draco malfoy 
 
 she told me of your suspicions yes said dumbledore 
 
 and do you 
 
 i shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in accident said dumbledore but what concerns me now harry is our lesson 
 
 harry felt slightly resentful at this if their lessons were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second however he said no more about draco malfoy but watched as dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his hands 
 
 you will remember i am sure that we left the tale of lord beginnings at the point where the handsome muggle tom riddle had abandoned his witch wife merope and returned to his family home in little hangleton merope was left alone in london expecting the baby who would one day become lord voldemort 
 
 how do you know she was in london sir 
 
 because of the evidence of one caractacus burke said dumbledore who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing 
 
 he swilled the contents of the pensieve as harry had seen him swill them before much as a gold prospector sifts for gold up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the pensieve silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes 
 
 yes we acquired it in curious circumstances it was brought in by a young witch just before christmas oh many years ago now she said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious covered in rags and pretty far along going to have a baby see she said the locket had been well we hear that sort of story all the time oh this was this was his favorite teapot but when i looked at it it had his mark all right and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth of course that made it near enough priceless she seem to have any idea how much it was worth happy to get ten galleons for it best bargain we ever made 
 
 dumbledore gave the pensieve an shake and caractacus burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come 
 
 he only gave her ten galleons said harry indignantly 
 
 caractacus burke was not famed for his generosity said dumbledore so we know that near the end of her pregnancy merope was alone in london and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that was one of treasured family heirlooms 
 
 but she could do magic said harry impatiently she could have got food and everything for herself by magic she 
 
 ah said dumbledore perhaps she could but it is my beliefi am guessing again but i am sure i am rightthat when her husband abandoned her merope stopped using magic i do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen in any case as you are about to see merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life 
 
 she even stay alive for her son 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows 
 
 could you possibly be feeling sorry for lord voldemort 
 
 no said harry quickly but she had a choice she not like my mother 
 
 your mother had a choice too said dumbledore gently yes merope riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly harry she was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your courage and now if you will stand 
 
 where are we going harry asked as dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk 
 
 this time said dumbledore we are going to enter my memory i think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate after you harry 
 
 harry bent over the pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again seconds later his feet hit firm ground he opened his eyes and found that he and dumbledore were standing in a bustling london street 
 
 there i am said dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a milk cart 
 
 this younger albus long hair and beard were auburn having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing 
 
 nice suit sir said harry before he could stop himself but dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building surrounded by high railings he mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once after a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron 
 
 good afternoon i have an appointment with a mrs cole who i believe is the matron here 
 
 oh said the girl taking in eccentric appearance um just a mo mrs cole she bellowed over her shoulder 
 
 harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response the girl turned back to dumbledore 
 
 come in on er way 
 
 dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean harry and the older dumbledore followed before the front door had closed behind them a skinny woman came scurrying toward them she had a face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward dumbledore 
 
 and take the iodine upstairs to martha billy stubbs has been picking his scabs and eric oozing all over his sheetschicken pox on top of everything else she said to nobody in particular and then her eyes fell upon dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold 
 
 good afternoon said dumbledore holding out his hand 
 
 mrs cole simply gaped 
 
 my name is albus dumbledore i sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today 
 
 mrs cole blinked apparently deciding that dumbledore was not a hallucination she said feebly oh yes wellwell better come into my room yes 
 
 she led dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room part office it was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched she invited dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously 
 
 i am here as i told you in my letter to discuss tom riddle and arrangements for his future said dumbledore 
 
 are you family asked mrs cole 
 
 no i am a teacher said dumbledore i have come to offer tom a place at my school 
 
 what this then 
 
 it is called hogwarts said dumbledore 
 
 and how come interested in tom 
 
 we believe he has qualities we are looking for 
 
 you mean won a scholarship how can he have done never been entered for one 
 
 well his name has been down for our school since birth 
 
 who registered him his parents 
 
 there was no doubt that mrs cole was an inconveniently sharp woman apparently dumbledore thought so too for harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from mrs desktop 
 
 here said dumbledore waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper i think this will make everything clear 
 
 mrs eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment 
 
 that seems perfectly in order she said placidly handing it back then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before 
 
 ermay i offer you a glass of gin she said in an voice 
 
 thank you very much said dumbledore beaming 
 
 it soon became clear that mrs cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp smacking her lips frankly she smiled at dumbledore for the first time and he hesitate to press his advantage 
 
 i was wondering whether you could tell me anything of tom history i think he was born here in the orphanage 
 
 right said mrs cole helping herself to more gin i remember it clear as anything because just started here myself new eve and bitter cold snowing you know nasty night and this girl not much older than i was myself at the time came staggering up the front steps well she the first we took her in and she had the baby within the hour and she was dead in another hour 
 
 mrs cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin 
 
 did she say anything before she died asked dumbledore anything about the father for instance 
 
 now as it happens she did said mrs cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story i remember she said to me i hope he looks like his papa and i lie she was right to hope it because she was no beautyand then she told me he was to be named tom for his father and marvolo for her fatheryes i know funny name it we wondered whether she came from a circusand she said the surname was to be riddle and she died soon after that without another word 
 
 well we named him just as said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no tom nor marvolo nor any kind of riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and been here ever since 
 
 mrs cole helped herself almost to another healthy measure of gin two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones then she said a funny boy 
 
 yes said dumbledore i thought he might be 
 
 he was a funny baby too he hardly ever cried you know and then when he got a little older he was odd 
 
 odd in what way asked dumbledore gently 
 
 well he 
 
 but mrs cole pulled up short and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot dumbledore over her gin glass 
 
 definitely got a place at your school you say 
 
 definitely said dumbledore 
 
 and nothing i say can change that 
 
 nothing said dumbledore 
 
 be taking him away whatever 
 
 whatever repeated dumbledore gravely 
 
 she squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him apparently she decided she could because she said in a sudden rush he scares the other children 
 
 you mean he is a bully asked dumbledore 
 
 i think he must be said mrs cole frowning slightly but very hard to catch him at it there have been incidents nasty things 
 
 dumbledore did not press her though harry could tell that he was interested she took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still 
 
 billy rabbit well tom said he do it and i see how he could have done but even so it hang itself from the rafters did it 
 
 i think so no said dumbledore quietly 
 
 but jiggered if i know how he got up there to do it all i know is he and billy had argued the day before and cole took another swig of gin slopping a little over her chin this time on the summer outingwe take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seasidewell amy benson and dennis bishop were never quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them was that gone into a cave with tom riddle he swore just gone exploring but something happened in there sure of it and well there have been a lot of things funny things 
 
 she looked around at dumbledore again and though her cheeks were flushed her gaze was steady 
 
 i think many people will be sorry to see the back of him 
 
 you understand sure that we will not be keeping him permanently said dumbledore he will have to return here at the very least every summer 
 
 oh well better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker said mrs cole with a slight hiccup she got to her feet and harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady even though of the gin was now gone i suppose like to see him 
 
 very much said dumbledore rising too 
 
 she led him out of her office and up the stone stairs calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed the orphans harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic they looked reasonably for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up 
 
 here we are said mrs cole as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor she knocked twice and entered 
 
 tom got a visitor this is mr dumbertonsorry dunderbore come to tell youwell let him do it 
 
 harry and the two dumbledores entered the room and mrs cole closed the door on them it was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead a boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book 
 
 there was no trace of the gaunts in tom face merope had got her dying wish he was his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven years old and pale his eyes narrowed slightly as he took in eccentric appearance there was a silence 
 
 how do you do tom said dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand 
 
 the boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor 
 
 i am professor dumbledore 
 
 professor repeated riddle he looked wary is that like doctor what are you here for did she get you in to have a look at me 
 
 he was pointing at the door through which mrs cole had just left 
 
 no no said dumbledore smiling 
 
 i believe you said riddle she wants me looked at she tell the truth 
 
 he spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking it was a command and it sounded as though he had given it many times before his eyes had widened and he was glaring at dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly after a few seconds riddle stopped glaring though he looked if anything warier still 
 
 who are you 
 
 i have told you my name is professor dumbledore and i work at a school called hogwarts i have come to offer you a place at my schoolyour new school if you would like to come 
 
 reaction to this was most surprising he leapt from the bed and backed away from dumbledore looking furious 
 
 you kid me the asylum where from it professor yes of coursewell not going see that old the one who should be in the asylum i never did anything to little amy benson or dennis bishop and you can ask them tell you 
 
 i am not from the asylum said dumbledore patiently i am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly i shall tell you about hogwarts of course if you would rather not come to the school nobody will force you 
 
 like to see them try sneered riddle 
 
 hogwarts dumbledore went on as though he had not heard last words is a school for people with special abilities 
 
 not mad 
 
 i know that you are not mad hogwarts is not a school for mad people it is a school of magic 
 
 there was silence riddle had frozen his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of as though trying to catch one of them lying 
 
 magic he repeated in a whisper 
 
 right said dumbledore 
 
 magic what i can do 
 
 what is it that you can do 
 
 all sorts breathed riddle a flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks he looked fevered i can make things move without touching them i can make animals do what i want them to do without training them i can make bad things happen to people who annoy me i can make them hurt if i want to 
 
 his legs were trembling he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer 
 
 i knew i was different he whispered to his own quivering fingers i knew i was special always i knew there was something 
 
 well you were quite right said dumbledore who was no longer smiling but watching riddle intently you are a wizard 
 
 riddle lifted his head his face was transfigured there was a wild happiness upon it yet for some reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial 
 
 are you a wizard too 
 
 yes i am 
 
 prove it said riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said tell the truth 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows if as i take it you are accepting your place at hogwarts 
 
 of course i am 
 
 then you will address me as professor or sir 
 
 expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice sorry sir i meantplease professor could you show me 
 
 harry was sure that dumbledore was going to refuse that he would tell riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at hogwarts that they were currently in a building full of muggles and must therefore be cautious to his great surprise however dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick 
 
 the wardrobe burst into flames 
 
 riddle jumped to his feet harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there but even as riddle rounded on dumbledore the flames vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged 
 
 riddle stared from the wardrobe to dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at the wand where can i get one of them 
 
 all in good time said dumbledore i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe 
 
 and sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it for the first time riddle looked frightened 
 
 open the door said dumbledore 
 
 riddle hesitated then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door on the topmost shelf above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it 
 
 take it out said dumbledore 
 
 riddle took down the quaking box he looked unnerved 
 
 is there anything in that box that you ought not to have asked dumbledore 
 
 riddle threw dumbledore a long clear calculating look yes i suppose so sir he said finally in an expressionless voice 
 
 open it said dumbledore 
 
 riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of small everyday objects a a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth organ among them once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets 
 
 you will return them to their owners with your apologies said dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket i shall know whether it has been done and be warned thieving is not tolerated at hogwarts 
 
 riddle did not look remotely abashed he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at dumbledore at last he said in a colorless voice yes sir 
 
 at hogwarts dumbledore went on we teach you not only to use magic but to control it you have inadvertently i am surebeen using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school you are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you but you should know that hogwarts can expel students and the ministry of magicyes there is a ministrywill punish lawbreakers still more severely all new wizards must accept that in entering our world they abide by our laws 
 
 yes sir said riddle again 
 
 it was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box when he had finished he turned to dumbledore and said baldly i got any money 
 
 that is easily remedied said dumbledore drawing a leather from his pocket there is a fund at hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes you might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but 
 
 where do you buy spellbooks interrupted riddle who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking dumbledore and was now examining a fat gold galleon 
 
 in diagon alley said dumbledore i have your list of books and school equipment with me i can help you find everything 
 
 coming with me asked riddle looking up 
 
 certainly if you 
 
 i need you said riddle used to doing things for myself i go round london on my own all the time how do you get to this diagon alleysir he added catching eye 
 
 harry thought that dumbledore would insist upon accompanying riddle but once again he was surprised dumbledore handed riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment and after telling riddle exactly how to get to the leaky cauldron from the orphanage he said you will be able to see it although muggles around people that iswill not ask for tom the barmaneasy enough to remember as he shares your name 
 
 riddle gave an irritable twitch as though trying to displace an irksome fly 
 
 you dislike the name tom 
 
 there are a lot of toms muttered riddle then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked was my father a wizard he was called tom riddle too told me 
 
 afraid i know said dumbledore his voice gentle 
 
 my mother have been magic or she have died said riddle more to himself than dumbledore it been him sowhen got all my stuff when do i come to this hogwarts 
 
 all the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope said dumbledore you will leave from cross station on the first of september there is a train ticket in there too 
 
 riddle nodded dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again taking it riddle said i can speak to snakes i found out when been to the country on tripsthey find me they whisper to me is that normal for a wizard 
 
 harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress 
 
 it is unusual said dumbledore after a hesitation but not unheard of 
 
 his tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over face they stood for a moment man and boy staring at each other then the handshake was broken dumbledore was at the door 
 
 goodbye tom i shall see you at hogwarts 
 
 i think that will do said the dumbledore at side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the office 
 
 sit down said dumbledore landing beside harry 
 
 harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen 
 
 he believed it much quicker than i didi mean when you told him he was a wizard said harry i believe hagrid at first when he told me 
 
 yes riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he wasto use his said dumbledore 
 
 did you knowthen asked harry 
 
 did i know that i had just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time said dumbledore no i had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is however i was certainly intrigued by him i returned to hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something i should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already i felt i ought to do for others sake as much as his 
 
 his powers as you heard were surprisingly for such a young wizard andmost interestingly and ominously of allhe had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously and as you saw they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards he was already using magic against other people to frighten to punish to control the little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive i can make them hurt if i want to 
 
 and he was a parselmouth interjected harry 
 
 yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the dark arts although as we know there are parselmouths among the great and the good too in fact his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty secrecy and domination 
 
 time is making fools of us again said dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the windows but before we part i want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings 
 
 firstly i hope you noticed reaction when i mentioned that another shared his first name tom 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 there he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that made him ordinary even then he wished to be different separate notorious he shed his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of lord voldemort behind which he has been hidden for so long 
 
 i trust that you also noticed that tom riddle was already highly secretive and apparently friendless he did not want help or companionship on his trip to diagon alley he preferred to operate alone the adult voldemort is the same you will hear many of his death eaters claiming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him they are deluded lord voldemort has never had a friend nor do i believe that he has ever wanted one 
 
 and lastly i hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this harrythe young tom riddle liked to collect trophies you saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room these were taken from victims of his bullying behavior souvenirs if you will of particularly unpleasant bits of magic bear in mind this tendency for this particularly will be important later 
 
 and now it really is time for bed 
 
 harry got to his feet as he walked across the room his eyes fell upon the little table on which marvolo ring had rested last time but the ring was no longer there 
 
 yes harry said dumbledore for harry had come to a halt 
 
 the gone said harry looking around but i thought i you might have the mouth organ or something 
 
 dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his spectacles 
 
 very astute harry but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ 
 
 and on that enigmatic note he waved to harry who understood himself to be dismissed

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the secret riddlecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 katie was removed to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries the following day by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school though the details were confused and nobody other than harry ron hermione and leanne seemed to know that katie herself had not been the intended target 
 
 oh and malfoy knows of course said harry to ron and hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever harry mentioned his theory 
 
 harry had wondered whether dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for monday lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside office at eight knocked and was told to enter there sat dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand was as black and burned as ever but he smiled when he gestured to harry to sit down the pensieve was sitting on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling 
 
 you have had a busy time while i have been away dumbledore said i believe you witnessed accident 
 
 yes sir how is she 
 
 still very unwell although she was relatively lucky she appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin there was a tiny hole in her glove had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly luckily professor snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse 
 
 why him asked harry quickly why not madam pomfrey 
 
 impertinent said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall and phineas nigellus black raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping i would not have permitted a student to question the way hogwarts operated in my day 
 
 yes thank you phineas said dumbledore quellingly professor snape knows much more about the dark arts than madam pomfrey harry anyway the st staff are sending me hourly reports and i am hopeful that katie will make a full recovery in time 
 
 where were you this weekend sir harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by phineas nigellus who hissed softly 
 
 i would rather not say just now said dumbledore however i shall tell you in due course 
 
 you will said harry startled 
 
 yes i expect so said dumbledore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand 
 
 sir said harry tentatively i met mundungus in hogsmeade 
 
 ah yes i am already aware that mundungus has been treating your inheritance with contempt said dumbledore frowning a little he has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the three broomsticks i rather think he dreads facing me however rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of old possessions 
 
 that mangy old has been stealing black heirlooms said phineas nigellus incensed and he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 professor said harry after a short pause did professor mcgonagall tell you what i told her after katie got hurt about draco malfoy 
 
 she told me of your suspicions yes said dumbledore 
 
 and do you 
 
 i shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in accident said dumbledore but what concerns me now harry is our lesson 
 
 harry felt slightly resentful at this if their lessons were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second however he said no more about draco malfoy but watched as dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his hands 
 
 you will remember i am sure that we left the tale of lord beginnings at the point where the handsome muggle tom riddle had abandoned his witch wife merope and returned to his family home in little hangleton merope was left alone in london expecting the baby who would one day become lord voldemort 
 
 how do you know she was in london sir 
 
 because of the evidence of one caractacus burke said dumbledore who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing 
 
 he swilled the contents of the pensieve as harry had seen him swill them before much as a gold prospector sifts for gold up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the pensieve silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes 
 
 yes we acquired it in curious circumstances it was brought in by a young witch just before christmas oh many years ago now she said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious covered in rags and pretty far along going to have a baby see she said the locket had been well we hear that sort of story all the time oh this was this was his favorite teapot but when i looked at it it had his mark all right and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth of course that made it near enough priceless she seem to have any idea how much it was worth happy to get ten galleons for it best bargain we ever made 
 
 dumbledore gave the pensieve an shake and caractacus burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come 
 
 he only gave her ten galleons said harry indignantly 
 
 caractacus burke was not famed for his generosity said dumbledore so we know that near the end of her pregnancy merope was alone in london and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that was one of treasured family heirlooms 
 
 but she could do magic said harry impatiently she could have got food and everything for herself by magic she 
 
 ah said dumbledore perhaps she could but it is my beliefi am guessing again but i am sure i am rightthat when her husband abandoned her merope stopped using magic i do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen in any case as you are about to see merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life 
 
 she even stay alive for her son 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows 
 
 could you possibly be feeling sorry for lord voldemort 
 
 no said harry quickly but she had a choice she not like my mother 
 
 your mother had a choice too said dumbledore gently yes merope riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly harry she was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your courage and now if you will stand 
 
 where are we going harry asked as dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk 
 
 this time said dumbledore we are going to enter my memory i think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate after you harry 
 
 harry bent over the pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again seconds later his feet hit firm ground he opened his eyes and found that he and dumbledore were standing in a bustling london street 
 
 there i am said dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a milk cart 
 
 this younger albus long hair and beard were auburn having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing 
 
 nice suit sir said harry before he could stop himself but dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building surrounded by high railings he mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once after a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron 
 
 good afternoon i have an appointment with a mrs cole who i believe is the matron here 
 
 oh said the girl taking in eccentric appearance um just a mo mrs cole she bellowed over her shoulder 
 
 harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response the girl turned back to dumbledore 
 
 come in on er way 
 
 dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean harry and the older dumbledore followed before the front door had closed behind them a skinny woman came scurrying toward them she had a face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward dumbledore 
 
 and take the iodine upstairs to martha billy stubbs has been picking his scabs and eric oozing all over his sheetschicken pox on top of everything else she said to nobody in particular and then her eyes fell upon dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold 
 
 good afternoon said dumbledore holding out his hand 
 
 mrs cole simply gaped 
 
 my name is albus dumbledore i sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today 
 
 mrs cole blinked apparently deciding that dumbledore was not a hallucination she said feebly oh yes wellwell better come into my room yes 
 
 she led dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room part office it was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched she invited dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously 
 
 i am here as i told you in my letter to discuss tom riddle and arrangements for his future said dumbledore 
 
 are you family asked mrs cole 
 
 no i am a teacher said dumbledore i have come to offer tom a place at my school 
 
 what this then 
 
 it is called hogwarts said dumbledore 
 
 and how come interested in tom 
 
 we believe he has qualities we are looking for 
 
 you mean won a scholarship how can he have done never been entered for one 
 
 well his name has been down for our school since birth 
 
 who registered him his parents 
 
 there was no doubt that mrs cole was an inconveniently sharp woman apparently dumbledore thought so too for harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from mrs desktop 
 
 here said dumbledore waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper i think this will make everything clear 
 
 mrs eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment 
 
 that seems perfectly in order she said placidly handing it back then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before 
 
 ermay i offer you a glass of gin she said in an voice 
 
 thank you very much said dumbledore beaming 
 
 it soon became clear that mrs cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp smacking her lips frankly she smiled at dumbledore for the first time and he hesitate to press his advantage 
 
 i was wondering whether you could tell me anything of tom history i think he was born here in the orphanage 
 
 right said mrs cole helping herself to more gin i remember it clear as anything because just started here myself new eve and bitter cold snowing you know nasty night and this girl not much older than i was myself at the time came staggering up the front steps well she the first we took her in and she had the baby within the hour and she was dead in another hour 
 
 mrs cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin 
 
 did she say anything before she died asked dumbledore anything about the father for instance 
 
 now as it happens she did said mrs cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story i remember she said to me i hope he looks like his papa and i lie she was right to hope it because she was no beautyand then she told me he was to be named tom for his father and marvolo for her fatheryes i know funny name it we wondered whether she came from a circusand she said the surname was to be riddle and she died soon after that without another word 
 
 well we named him just as said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no tom nor marvolo nor any kind of riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and been here ever since 
 
 mrs cole helped herself almost to another healthy measure of gin two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones then she said a funny boy 
 
 yes said dumbledore i thought he might be 
 
 he was a funny baby too he hardly ever cried you know and then when he got a little older he was odd 
 
 odd in what way asked dumbledore gently 
 
 well he 
 
 but mrs cole pulled up short and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot dumbledore over her gin glass 
 
 definitely got a place at your school you say 
 
 definitely said dumbledore 
 
 and nothing i say can change that 
 
 nothing said dumbledore 
 
 be taking him away whatever 
 
 whatever repeated dumbledore gravely 
 
 she squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him apparently she decided she could because she said in a sudden rush he scares the other children 
 
 you mean he is a bully asked dumbledore 
 
 i think he must be said mrs cole frowning slightly but very hard to catch him at it there have been incidents nasty things 
 
 dumbledore did not press her though harry could tell that he was interested she took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still 
 
 billy rabbit well tom said he do it and i see how he could have done but even so it hang itself from the rafters did it 
 
 i think so no said dumbledore quietly 
 
 but jiggered if i know how he got up there to do it all i know is he and billy had argued the day before and cole took another swig of gin slopping a little over her chin this time on the summer outingwe take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seasidewell amy benson and dennis bishop were never quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them was that gone into a cave with tom riddle he swore just gone exploring but something happened in there sure of it and well there have been a lot of things funny things 
 
 she looked around at dumbledore again and though her cheeks were flushed her gaze was steady 
 
 i think many people will be sorry to see the back of him 
 
 you understand sure that we will not be keeping him permanently said dumbledore he will have to return here at the very least every summer 
 
 oh well better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker said mrs cole with a slight hiccup she got to her feet and harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady even though of the gin was now gone i suppose like to see him 
 
 very much said dumbledore rising too 
 
 she led him out of her office and up the stone stairs calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed the orphans harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic they looked reasonably for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up 
 
 here we are said mrs cole as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor she knocked twice and entered 
 
 tom got a visitor this is mr dumbertonsorry dunderbore come to tell youwell let him do it 
 
 harry and the two dumbledores entered the room and mrs cole closed the door on them it was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead a boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book 
 
 there was no trace of the gaunts in tom face merope had got her dying wish he was his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven years old and pale his eyes narrowed slightly as he took in eccentric appearance there was a silence 
 
 how do you do tom said dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand 
 
 the boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor 
 
 i am professor dumbledore 
 
 professor repeated riddle he looked wary is that like doctor what are you here for did she get you in to have a look at me 
 
 he was pointing at the door through which mrs cole had just left 
 
 no no said dumbledore smiling 
 
 i believe you said riddle she wants me looked at she tell the truth 
 
 he spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking it was a command and it sounded as though he had given it many times before his eyes had widened and he was glaring at dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly after a few seconds riddle stopped glaring though he looked if anything warier still 
 
 who are you 
 
 i have told you my name is professor dumbledore and i work at a school called hogwarts i have come to offer you a place at my schoolyour new school if you would like to come 
 
 reaction to this was most surprising he leapt from the bed and backed away from dumbledore looking furious 
 
 you kid me the asylum where from it professor yes of coursewell not going see that old the one who should be in the asylum i never did anything to little amy benson or dennis bishop and you can ask them tell you 
 
 i am not from the asylum said dumbledore patiently i am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly i shall tell you about hogwarts of course if you would rather not come to the school nobody will force you 
 
 like to see them try sneered riddle 
 
 hogwarts dumbledore went on as though he had not heard last words is a school for people with special abilities 
 
 not mad 
 
 i know that you are not mad hogwarts is not a school for mad people it is a school of magic 
 
 there was silence riddle had frozen his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of as though trying to catch one of them lying 
 
 magic he repeated in a whisper 
 
 right said dumbledore 
 
 magic what i can do 
 
 what is it that you can do 
 
 all sorts breathed riddle a flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks he looked fevered i can make things move without touching them i can make animals do what i want them to do without training them i can make bad things happen to people who annoy me i can make them hurt if i want to 
 
 his legs were trembling he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer 
 
 i knew i was different he whispered to his own quivering fingers i knew i was special always i knew there was something 
 
 well you were quite right said dumbledore who was no longer smiling but watching riddle intently you are a wizard 
 
 riddle lifted his head his face was transfigured there was a wild happiness upon it yet for some reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial 
 
 are you a wizard too 
 
 yes i am 
 
 prove it said riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said tell the truth 
 
 dumbledore raised his eyebrows if as i take it you are accepting your place at hogwarts 
 
 of course i am 
 
 then you will address me as professor or sir 
 
 expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice sorry sir i meantplease professor could you show me 
 
 harry was sure that dumbledore was going to refuse that he would tell riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at hogwarts that they were currently in a building full of muggles and must therefore be cautious to his great surprise however dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick 
 
 the wardrobe burst into flames 
 
 riddle jumped to his feet harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there but even as riddle rounded on dumbledore the flames vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged 
 
 riddle stared from the wardrobe to dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at the wand where can i get one of them 
 
 all in good time said dumbledore i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe 
 
 and sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it for the first time riddle looked frightened 
 
 open the door said dumbledore 
 
 riddle hesitated then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door on the topmost shelf above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it 
 
 take it out said dumbledore 
 
 riddle took down the quaking box he looked unnerved 
 
 is there anything in that box that you ought not to have asked dumbledore 
 
 riddle threw dumbledore a long clear calculating look yes i suppose so sir he said finally in an expressionless voice 
 
 open it said dumbledore 
 
 riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of small everyday objects a a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth organ among them once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets 
 
 you will return them to their owners with your apologies said dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket i shall know whether it has been done and be warned thieving is not tolerated at hogwarts 
 
 riddle did not look remotely abashed he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at dumbledore at last he said in a colorless voice yes sir 
 
 at hogwarts dumbledore went on we teach you not only to use magic but to control it you have inadvertently i am surebeen using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school you are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you but you should know that hogwarts can expel students and the ministry of magicyes there is a ministrywill punish lawbreakers still more severely all new wizards must accept that in entering our world they abide by our laws 
 
 yes sir said riddle again 
 
 it was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box when he had finished he turned to dumbledore and said baldly i got any money 
 
 that is easily remedied said dumbledore drawing a leather from his pocket there is a fund at hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes you might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but 
 
 where do you buy spellbooks interrupted riddle who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking dumbledore and was now examining a fat gold galleon 
 
 in diagon alley said dumbledore i have your list of books and school equipment with me i can help you find everything 
 
 coming with me asked riddle looking up 
 
 certainly if you 
 
 i need you said riddle used to doing things for myself i go round london on my own all the time how do you get to this diagon alleysir he added catching eye 
 
 harry thought that dumbledore would insist upon accompanying riddle but once again he was surprised dumbledore handed riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment and after telling riddle exactly how to get to the leaky cauldron from the orphanage he said you will be able to see it although muggles around people that iswill not ask for tom the barmaneasy enough to remember as he shares your name 
 
 riddle gave an irritable twitch as though trying to displace an irksome fly 
 
 you dislike the name tom 
 
 there are a lot of toms muttered riddle then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked was my father a wizard he was called tom riddle too told me 
 
 afraid i know said dumbledore his voice gentle 
 
 my mother have been magic or she have died said riddle more to himself than dumbledore it been him sowhen got all my stuff when do i come to this hogwarts 
 
 all the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope said dumbledore you will leave from cross station on the first of september there is a train ticket in there too 
 
 riddle nodded dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again taking it riddle said i can speak to snakes i found out when been to the country on tripsthey find me they whisper to me is that normal for a wizard 
 
 harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress 
 
 it is unusual said dumbledore after a hesitation but not unheard of 
 
 his tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over face they stood for a moment man and boy staring at each other then the handshake was broken dumbledore was at the door 
 
 goodbye tom i shall see you at hogwarts 
 
 i think that will do said the dumbledore at side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the office 
 
 sit down said dumbledore landing beside harry 
 
 harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen 
 
 he believed it much quicker than i didi mean when you told him he was a wizard said harry i believe hagrid at first when he told me 
 
 yes riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he wasto use his said dumbledore 
 
 did you knowthen asked harry 
 
 did i know that i had just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time said dumbledore no i had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is however i was certainly intrigued by him i returned to hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something i should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already i felt i ought to do for others sake as much as his 
 
 his powers as you heard were surprisingly for such a young wizard andmost interestingly and ominously of allhe had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously and as you saw they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards he was already using magic against other people to frighten to punish to control the little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive i can make them hurt if i want to 
 
 and he was a parselmouth interjected harry 
 
 yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the dark arts although as we know there are parselmouths among the great and the good too in fact his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty secrecy and domination 
 
 time is making fools of us again said dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the windows but before we part i want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings 
 
 firstly i hope you noticed reaction when i mentioned that another shared his first name tom 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 there he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that made him ordinary even then he wished to be different separate notorious he shed his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of lord voldemort behind which he has been hidden for so long 
 
 i trust that you also noticed that tom riddle was already highly secretive and apparently friendless he did not want help or companionship on his trip to diagon alley he preferred to operate alone the adult voldemort is the same you will hear many of his death eaters claiming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him they are deluded lord voldemort has never had a friend nor do i believe that he has ever wanted one 
 
 and lastly i hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this harrythe young tom riddle liked to collect trophies you saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room these were taken from victims of his bullying behavior souvenirs if you will of particularly unpleasant bits of magic bear in mind this tendency for this particularly will be important later 
 
 and now it really is time for bed 
 
 harry got to his feet as he walked across the room his eyes fell upon the little table on which marvolo ring had rested last time but the ring was no longer there 
 
 yes harry said dumbledore for harry had come to a halt 
 
 the gone said harry looking around but i thought i you might have the mouth organ or something 
 
 dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his spectacles 
 
 very astute harry but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ 
 
 and on that enigmatic note he waved to harry who understood himself to be dismissed

 ah mafalda said umbridge looking at hermione travers sent you did he 
 
 squeaked hermione 
 
 god youll do perfectly well umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold thats that problem solved minister if mafalda can be spared for we shall be able to start straightaway she consulted her clipboard ten people today and one of them the wife of a ministry employee tut tut even here in the heart of the ministry she stepped into the lift besides hermione as did the two wizards who had been listening to umbridges conversation with the minister well go straight down mafalda youll find everything you need in the courtroom good morning albert arent you getting out 
 
 yes of course said harry in runcorns deep voice 
 
 harry stepped out of the life the golden grilles clanged shut behind him glancing over his shoulder harry saw hermiones anxious face sinking back out of sight a tall wizard on either side of her umbridges velvet level with her shoulder 
 
 what brings you here runcorn asked the new minister of magic his long black hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes putting harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock 
 
 needed a quick word with harry hesitated for a fraction of a second arthur weasley someone said he was up on level one 
 
 ah said plum thicknesse has he been caught having contact with an undesirable 
 
 no said harry his throat dry no nothing like that 
 
 ah well its only a matter of time said thicknesse if you ask me the blood traitors are as bad as the mudbloods good day runcorn 
 
 good day minister 
 
 harry watched thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor the moment the minister had passed out of sight harry tugged the invisibility cloak out from under his heavy black cloak threw it over himself and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction runcorn was so tall that harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden 
 
 panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach as he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door each bearing a small plaque with the owners name and occupation upon it the might of the ministry its complexity its impenetrability seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with ron and hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish they had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected they had not given a moments thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate now hermione was stuck in court proceedings which would undoubtedly last hours ron was struggling to do magic that harry was sure was beyond him a womans liberty possibly depending on the outcome and he harry was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift 
 
 he stopped walking leaned against a wall and tried to decide what to do the silence pressed upon him there was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the corridors were as hushed as though the muffliato charm had been cast over the place 
 
 her office must be up here harry thought 
 
 it seemed most unlikely that umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure he therefore set off along the corridor again passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him scribbling on a trail of parchment 
 
 now paying attention to the names on the doors harry turned a corner halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks though much more highly polished and free from graffiti harry paused to watch them for the effect was quite mesmerizing they were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites after a few seconds harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets c that the paper squares were pages which when assembled folded and magicked into place fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard 
 
 harry crept closer although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a footstep and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch he examined it beneath the invisibility cloak its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title 
 
 
 
 
 mudbloods 
 and the dangers they pose to a peaceful society 
 beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl there was no authors name upon the pamphlet but again the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said still waving and twirling her wand will the old hag be interrogating mudbloods all day does anyone know 
 
 careful said the wizard beside her glancing around nervously one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor 
 
 what has she got magic ears as well as an eye now 
 
 the witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of harry looked too and the rage reared in him like a snake where there might have been a peephole on a muggle front door a large round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood c an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known alastor moody 
 
 for a split second harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there he even forgot that he was invisible he strode straight over to the door to examine the eye it was not moving it gazed blindly upward frozen the plaque beneath it read 
 
 
 
 
 dolores umbridge 
 senior undersecretary to the minister 
 
 
 
 below that a slightly shinier new plaque read 
 
 
 
 
 head of the registration commission 
 
 
 
 harry looked back at the dozen though they were intent upon their work he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them he therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a horn for a body crouching down beneath the cloak he placed the decoy detonator on the ground 
 
 it scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him a few moments later during which harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner the young witch in the front row shrieked pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up looking around for the source of the commotion harry turned the doorknob stepped into umbridges office and closed the door behind him 
 
 he felt he had stepped back in time the room was exactly like umbridges office at hogwarts lace draperies doilies and dried flowers covered every surface the walls bore the same ornamental plates each featuring a highly colored beribboned kitten gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness the desk was covered with a flouncy flowered cloth behind eye a telescopic attachment enabled umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the decoy detonator he wrenched the telescope out of the door leaving a hole behind pulled the magical eyeball out of it and placed it in his pocket the he turned to face the room again raised his wand and murmured accio locker 
 
 nothing happened but he had not expected it to no doubt umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells he therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open all the drawers he saw quills and notebooks and spellotape enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had be beaten back a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips but no sign of a locket 
 
 there was a filing cabinet behind the desk harry set to searching it like filchs filing cabinet at hogwarts it was full of folders each labeled with a name it was not until harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from the search mr weasleys file 
 
 he pulled it out and opened it 
 
 
 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 
 
 
 blood status 
 pureblood but with unacceptable leanings known member of the order of the phoenix 
 
 family 
 wife pureblood seven children two youngest at hogwarts nb youngest son currently at home seriously ill ministry inspectors have confirmed 
 
 security status 
 tracked all movements are being monitored strong likelihood undesirable no will contact has stayed with weasley family previously 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 undesirable number one harry muttered under his breath as he replaced mr weasleys folder and shut the drawer he had an idea he knew who that was and sure enough as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on the wall with the words undesirable no emblazoned across his chest a little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner harry moved across to read it and saw that umbridge had written to be punished 
 
 angrier than ever he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there he gave the office one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror propped up on a bookcase beside the desk 
 
 harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up but realized that the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat c the life and lies of albus dumbledore c nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest by rita skeeter bestselling author of armando dippet master or moron 
 
 harry opened the book at random and saw a photograph of two teenage boys both laughing immoderately with their arms around each others shoulders dumbledore now with hair had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on krums chin that had so annoyed ron the boy who roared in silent amusement beside dumbledore had a gleeful wild look about him his golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders harry wondered whether it was a young doge but before he could check the caption the door of the office opened 
 
 if thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered harry would not have had time to pull the invisibility cloak over himself as it was he thought thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still staring curiously at the place where harry had just vanished perhaps deciding that that all he had seen was dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book for harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot it sprang out and began scribbling a note to umbridge very slowly hardly daring to breathe harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond 
 
 the were still clustered around the remains of the decoy detonator which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said i bet it sneaked up here from experimental charms theyre so careless remember that poisonous duck 
 
 speeding back toward the lifts harry reviewed his options it had never been likely that the locket was here at the ministry and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court their priority now had to be to leave the ministry before they were exposed and try again another day the first thing to do was to find ron and then they could work out a way of extracting hermione from the courtroom 
 
 the lift was empty when it arrived harry jumped in and pulled off the invisibility cloak as it started its descent to his enormous relief when it rattled to a halt at level two a and ron got in 
 
 he stammered to harry as the lift set off again 
 
 ron its me harry 
 
 harry blimey i forgot what you looked like c why isnt hermione with you 
 
 she had to go down to the courtrooms with umbridge she couldnt refuse and c 
 
 but before harry could finish the lift had stopped again the doors opened and mr weasley walked inside talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill 
 
 i quite understand what youre saying wakanda but im afraid i cannot be party to c 
 
 mr weasley broke off he had noticed harry it was very strange to have mr weasley glare at him with that much dislike the lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more 
 
 oh hello reg said mr weasley looking around at the sound of steady dripping from rons robes isnt your wife in for questioning today er c whats happened to you why are you so wet 
 
 yaxleys office is raining said ron he addressed mr weasleys shoulder and harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each others eyes i couldnt stop it so theyve sent me to get bernie c pillsworth i think they said c 
 
 yes a lot of offices have been raining lately said mr weasley did you try meterolojinx recanto it worked for bletchley 
 
 meteolojinx recanto whispered ron no i didnt thanks d c i mean thanks arthur 
 
 the lift doors opened the old witch with the anthill hair left and ron darted past her out of sight harry made to follow him but found his path blocked as percy weasley strode into the lift his nose buried in some papers he was reading 
 
 not until the doors had clanged shut again did percy realize he was in a lit with his father he glanced up saw mr weasley turned radish red and left the lift the moment the doors opened again for the second time harry tried to get out but this time found his way blocked by mr weasleys arm 
 
 one moment runcorn 
 
 the lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor mr weasley said i hear you had information about dirk cresswell 
 
 harry had the impression that mr weasleys anger was no less because of the brush with percy he decided his best chance was to act stupid 
 
 sorry he said 
 
 dont pretend runcorn said mr weasley fiercely you tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree didnt you 
 
 i c so what if i did said harry 
 
 so dirk cresswell is ten times the wizard you are said mr weasley quietly as the lift sank ever lower and if he survives azkaban youll have to answer to him not to mention his wife his sons and his friends c 
 
 arthur harry interrupted you know youre being tracked dont you 
 
 is that a threat runcorn said mr weasley loudly 
 
 no said harry its a fact theyre watching your every move c 
 
 the lift doors opened they had reached the atrium mr weasley gave harry a scathing look and swept from the lift harry stood there shaken he wished he was impersonating somebody other than runcorn the lift doors clanged shut 
 
 harry pulled out the invisibility cloak and put it back on he would try to extricate hermione on his own while ron was dealing with the raining office when the doors opened he stepped out into a stone passageway quite different from the and carpeted corridors above as the left rattled away again harry shivered slightly looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the department of mysteries 
 
 he set off his destination not the black door but the doorway he remembered on the left hand side which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers his mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them he still had a couple of decoy detonators but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door enter as runcorn and ask for a quick word with mafalda of course he did not know whether runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this and even if he managed it hermiones might trigger a search before they were clear of the ministry 
 
 lost in thought he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him as if he were descending into fog it was becoming colder and colder with every step he took a cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs and then he felt that stealing sense of despair or hopelessness filling him expanding inside him 
 
 dementors he thought 
 
 and as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene the dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall figures their faces completely hidden their ragged breathing the only sound in the place the petrified brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches most of them were hiding their faces in their hands perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors greedy mouths some were accompanied by families others sat alone the dementors were gliding up and down in front of them and the cold and the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid themselves upon harry like a curse 
 
 fight it he told himself but he knew that he could not conjure a patronus here without revealing himself instantly so he moved forward as silently as he could and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain but he forced himself to think of hermione and of ron who needed him 
 
 moving through the towering black figures was terrifying the eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed and he felt sure that they sensed him sensed perhaps a human presence that still had some hope some resilience 
 
 and then abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it 
 
 no no im im i tell you my father was a wizard he was look him up arkie alderton hes a well known broomstick designer look him up i tell you c get your hands off me get your hands off c 
 
 this is your final warning said umbridges soft voice magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the mans desperate screams if you struggle you will be subjected to the dementors kiss 
 
 the mans screams subsided but dry sobs echoed through the corridor 
 
 take him away said umbridge 
 
 two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom their rotting scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting they glided away down the corridor with him and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight 
 
 next c mary cattermole called umbridge 
 
 a small woman stood up she was trembling from head to foot her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes her face was completely bloodless as she passed the dementors harry saw her shudder 
 
 he did it instinctively without any sort of plan because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon as the door began to swing closed he slipped into the courtroom behind her 
 
 it was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic this one was much smaller though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well 
 
 there were more dementors in here casting their freezing aura over the place they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform here behind a balustrade sat umbridge with yaxley on one side of her and hermione quite as as mrs cattermole on the other at the foot of the platform a cat prowled up and down up and down and harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors that was for the accused to feel not the accusers 
 
 sit down said umbridge in her soft silky voice 
 
 mrs cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform the moment she had sat down chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there 
 
 you are mary elizabeth cattermole asked umbridge 
 
 mrs cattermole gave a single shaky nod 
 
 married to reginald cattermole of the magical maintenance department 
 
 mrs cattermole burst into tears 
 
 i dont know where he is he was supposed to meet me here 
 
 umbridge ignored her 
 
 mother to maisie ellie and alfred cattermole 
 
 mrs cattermole sobbed harder than ever 
 
 theyre frightened they think that i might not come home c 
 
 spare us spat yaxley the brats of mudbloods do not stir our sympathies 
 
 mrs cattermoles sobs masked harrys footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform the moment he had passed the place where the patronus cat patrolled he felt the change in temperature it was warm and comfortable here the patronus he was sure was umbridges and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here in her element upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind umbridge yaxley and hermione taking a seat behind the latter he was worried about making hermione jump he thought of casting the muffliato charm upon umbridge and yaxley but even murmuring the word might cause hermione alarm then umbridge raised her voice to address mrs cattermole and harry seized his chance 
 
 im behind you he whispered into hermiones ear 
 
 as he had expected she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview but both umbridge and yaxley were concentrating upon mrs cattermole and this went unnoticed 
 
 a wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the ministry today mrs cattermole umbridge was saying inches cherry core do you recognize the description 
 
 mrs cattermole nodded mopping her eyes on her sleeve 
 
 could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand 
 
 sobbed mrs cattermole i didnt it from anybody i it when i was eleven years old it c it c it c chose me 
 
 she cried harder than ever 
 
 umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made harry want to attack her she leaned forward over the barrier the better to observe her victim and something gold swung forward too and dangled over the void the locket 
 
 hermione had seen it she let out a little squeak but umbridge and yaxley still intent upon their prey were deaf to everything else 
 
 no said umbridge no i dont think so mrs cattermole wands only choose witches or wizards you are not a witch i have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here c mafalda pass them to me 
 
 umbridge held out a small hand she looked so toadlike at that moment that harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers hermiones hands were shaking with shock she fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with mrs cattermoles name on it 
 
 thats c thats pretty dolores she said pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of umbridges blouse 
 
 what snapped umbridge glancing down oh yes c an old family heirloom she said patting the locket lying on her large bosom the s stands for selwyn i am related to the selwyns indeed there are few families to whom i am not related a pity she continued in a louder voice flicking through mrs cattermoles questionnaire that the same cannot be said for you parents professions greengrocers 
 
 yaxley laughed jeeringly below the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down and the dementors stood waiting in the corners 
 
 it was umbridges lie that brought the blood surging into harrys brain and obliterated his sense of caution c that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own credentials he raised his wand not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the invisibility cloak and said stupefy 
 
 there was a flash of red light umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade mrs cattermoles papers slid off her lap onto the floor and down below the prowling silver cat vanished air hit them like an oncoming wind yaxley confused looked around for the source of the trouble and saw harrys disembodied hand and wand pointing at him he tried to draw his own wand but too late stupefy 
 
 yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor 
 
 harry 
 
 hermione if you think i was going to sit here and let her pretend c 
 
 harry mrs cattermole 
 
 harry whirled around throwing off the invisibility cloak down below the dementors had moved out of their corners they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair whether because the patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control they seemed to have abandoned restraint mrs cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 the silver stag soared from the tip of harrys wand and leaped toward the dementors which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again the stags light more powerful and more warming than the cats protection filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room 
 
 get the horcrux harry told hermione 
 
 he ran back down the steps stuffing the invisibility cloak into his back and approached mrs cattermole 
 
 you she whispered gazing into his face but c but reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning 
 
 did i muttered harry tugging at the chains binding her arms well ive had a change of heart diffindo nothing happened hermione how do i get rid of these chains 
 
 wait im trying something up here c 
 
 hermione were surrounded by dementors 
 
 i know that harry but if she wakes up and the lockets gone c i need to duplicate it c geminio there that should fool her 
 
 hermione came running downstairs 
 
 lets see relashio 
 
 the chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair mrs cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before 
 
 i dont understand she whispered 
 
 youre going to leave here with us said harry pulling her to her feet go home grab your children and get out get out of the country if youve got to disguise yourselves and run youve seen how it is you wont get anything like a fair hearing here 
 
 harry said hermione how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door 
 
 patronuses said harry pointing his wand at his own the stag slowed and walked still gleaming brightly toward the door as many as we can muster do yours hermione 
 
 expec c expecto patronum said hermione nothing happened 
 
 its the only spell she ever has trouble with harry told a completely bemused mrs cattermole bit unfortunate really come on hermione 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 a silver otter burst from the end of hermiones wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag 
 
 cmon said harry and he led hermione and mrs cattermole to the door 
 
 when the patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside harry looked around the dementors were falling back on both sides of them melding into the darkness scattering before the silver creatures 
 
 its been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families harry told the waiting who were dazzled by the light of the patronuses and still cowering slightly go abroad if you can just get well away from the ministry thats the c er c new official position now if youll just follow the patronuses youll be able to leave the atrium 
 
 they managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted but as they approached the lifts harry started to have misgivings if they emerged into the atrium with a silver stag and otter soaring alongside it and twenty or so people half of them accused he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention he had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them 
 
 reg screamed mrs cattermole and she threw herself into rons arms runcorn let me out he attacked umbridge and yaxley and hes told all of us to leave the country i think wed better do it reg i really do lets hurry home and fetch the children and c why are you so wet 
 
 water muttered ron disengaging himself harry they know there are intruders inside the ministry something about a hole in umbridges office door i reckon weve got five minutes if that c 
 
 hermiones patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to harry 
 
 harry if were trapped here c 
 
 we wont be if we move fast said harry he addressed the silent group behind them who were all gawping at him 
 
 whos got wands 
 
 about half of them raised their hands 
 
 okay all of you who havent got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has well need to be fast before they stop us come on 
 
 they managed to cram themselves into two lifts harrys patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise 
 
 level eight said the witchs cool voice atrium 
 
 harry knew at once that they were in trouble the atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace sealing them off 
 
 harry squeaked hermione what are we going to c 
 
 stop harry thundered and the powerful voice of runcorn echoed through the atrium the wizards sealing the fireplaces froze follow me he whispered to the group of terrified who moved forward in a huddle shepherded by ron and hermione 
 
 whats up albert said the same balding wizard who had followed harry out of the fireplace earlier he looked nervous 
 
 this lot need to leave before you seal the exits said harry with all the authority he could muster 
 
 the group of wizards in front of him looked at one another 
 
 weve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone c 
 
 are you contradicting me harry blustered would you like me to have your family tree examined like i had dirk cresswells 
 
 sorry gasped the balding wizard backing away i didnt mean nothing albert but i thought i thought they were in for questioning and 
 
 their blood is pure said harry and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall purer than many of yours i daresay off you go he boomed to the who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs the ministry wizards hung back some looking confused others scared and fearful then 
 
 mary 
 
 mrs cattermole looked over her shoulder the real reg cattermole no longer vomiting but pale and wan had just come running out of a lift 
 
 r reg 
 
 she looked from her husband to ron who swore loudly 
 
 the balding wizard gaped his head turning ludicrously from one reg cattermole to the other 
 
 hey c whats going on what is this 
 
 seal the exit seal it 
 
 yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the but mrs cattermole had now vanished as the balding wizard lifted his wand harry raised an enormous fist and punched him sending him flying through the air 
 
 hes been helping escape yaxley harry shouted 
 
 the balding wizards colleagues set up and uproar under cover of which ron grabbed mrs cattermole pulled her into the fireplace and disappeared confused yaxley looked from harry to the punched wizard while the real reg cattermole screamed my wife who was that with my wife whats going on 
 
 harry saw yaxleys head turn saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face 
 
 come on harry shouted at hermione he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as yaxleys curse sailed over harrys head they spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle harry flung open the door ron was standing there beside the sinks still wrestling with mrs cattermole 
 
 reg i dont understand c 
 
 let go im not your husband youve got to go home 
 
 there was a noise in the cubicle behind them harry looked around yaxley had just appeared 
 
 lets go harry yelled he seized hermione by the hand and ron by the arm and turned on the stop 
 
 darkness engulfed them along with the sensation of compressing hands but something was wrong hermiones hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip 
 
 he wondered whether he was going to suffocate he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were rons arm and hermiones fingers which were slowly slipping away 
 
 and then he saw the door to number twelve grimmauld place with its serpent door knocker but before he could draw breath there was a scream and a flash of purple light hermiones hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirteen the registration commissioncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 ah mafalda said umbridge looking at hermione travers sent you did he 
 
 squeaked hermione 
 
 god youll do perfectly well umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold thats that problem solved minister if mafalda can be spared for we shall be able to start straightaway she consulted her clipboard ten people today and one of them the wife of a ministry employee tut tut even here in the heart of the ministry she stepped into the lift besides hermione as did the two wizards who had been listening to umbridges conversation with the minister well go straight down mafalda youll find everything you need in the courtroom good morning albert arent you getting out 
 
 yes of course said harry in runcorns deep voice 
 
 harry stepped out of the life the golden grilles clanged shut behind him glancing over his shoulder harry saw hermiones anxious face sinking back out of sight a tall wizard on either side of her umbridges velvet level with her shoulder 
 
 what brings you here runcorn asked the new minister of magic his long black hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes putting harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock 
 
 needed a quick word with harry hesitated for a fraction of a second arthur weasley someone said he was up on level one 
 
 ah said plum thicknesse has he been caught having contact with an undesirable 
 
 no said harry his throat dry no nothing like that 
 
 ah well its only a matter of time said thicknesse if you ask me the blood traitors are as bad as the mudbloods good day runcorn 
 
 good day minister 
 
 harry watched thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor the moment the minister had passed out of sight harry tugged the invisibility cloak out from under his heavy black cloak threw it over himself and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction runcorn was so tall that harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden 
 
 panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach as he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door each bearing a small plaque with the owners name and occupation upon it the might of the ministry its complexity its impenetrability seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with ron and hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish they had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected they had not given a moments thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate now hermione was stuck in court proceedings which would undoubtedly last hours ron was struggling to do magic that harry was sure was beyond him a womans liberty possibly depending on the outcome and he harry was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift 
 
 he stopped walking leaned against a wall and tried to decide what to do the silence pressed upon him there was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the corridors were as hushed as though the muffliato charm had been cast over the place 
 
 her office must be up here harry thought 
 
 it seemed most unlikely that umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure he therefore set off along the corridor again passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him scribbling on a trail of parchment 
 
 now paying attention to the names on the doors harry turned a corner halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks though much more highly polished and free from graffiti harry paused to watch them for the effect was quite mesmerizing they were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites after a few seconds harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets c that the paper squares were pages which when assembled folded and magicked into place fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard 
 
 harry crept closer although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a footstep and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch he examined it beneath the invisibility cloak its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title 
 
 
 
 
 mudbloods 
 and the dangers they pose to a peaceful society 
 beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl there was no authors name upon the pamphlet but again the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said still waving and twirling her wand will the old hag be interrogating mudbloods all day does anyone know 
 
 careful said the wizard beside her glancing around nervously one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor 
 
 what has she got magic ears as well as an eye now 
 
 the witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of harry looked too and the rage reared in him like a snake where there might have been a peephole on a muggle front door a large round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood c an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known alastor moody 
 
 for a split second harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there he even forgot that he was invisible he strode straight over to the door to examine the eye it was not moving it gazed blindly upward frozen the plaque beneath it read 
 
 
 
 
 dolores umbridge 
 senior undersecretary to the minister 
 
 
 
 below that a slightly shinier new plaque read 
 
 
 
 
 head of the registration commission 
 
 
 
 harry looked back at the dozen though they were intent upon their work he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them he therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a horn for a body crouching down beneath the cloak he placed the decoy detonator on the ground 
 
 it scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him a few moments later during which harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner the young witch in the front row shrieked pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up looking around for the source of the commotion harry turned the doorknob stepped into umbridges office and closed the door behind him 
 
 he felt he had stepped back in time the room was exactly like umbridges office at hogwarts lace draperies doilies and dried flowers covered every surface the walls bore the same ornamental plates each featuring a highly colored beribboned kitten gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness the desk was covered with a flouncy flowered cloth behind eye a telescopic attachment enabled umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the decoy detonator he wrenched the telescope out of the door leaving a hole behind pulled the magical eyeball out of it and placed it in his pocket the he turned to face the room again raised his wand and murmured accio locker 
 
 nothing happened but he had not expected it to no doubt umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells he therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open all the drawers he saw quills and notebooks and spellotape enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had be beaten back a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips but no sign of a locket 
 
 there was a filing cabinet behind the desk harry set to searching it like filchs filing cabinet at hogwarts it was full of folders each labeled with a name it was not until harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from the search mr weasleys file 
 
 he pulled it out and opened it 
 
 
 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 
 
 
 blood status 
 pureblood but with unacceptable leanings known member of the order of the phoenix 
 
 family 
 wife pureblood seven children two youngest at hogwarts nb youngest son currently at home seriously ill ministry inspectors have confirmed 
 
 security status 
 tracked all movements are being monitored strong likelihood undesirable no will contact has stayed with weasley family previously 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 undesirable number one harry muttered under his breath as he replaced mr weasleys folder and shut the drawer he had an idea he knew who that was and sure enough as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on the wall with the words undesirable no emblazoned across his chest a little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner harry moved across to read it and saw that umbridge had written to be punished 
 
 angrier than ever he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there he gave the office one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror propped up on a bookcase beside the desk 
 
 harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up but realized that the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat c the life and lies of albus dumbledore c nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest by rita skeeter bestselling author of armando dippet master or moron 
 
 harry opened the book at random and saw a photograph of two teenage boys both laughing immoderately with their arms around each others shoulders dumbledore now with hair had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on krums chin that had so annoyed ron the boy who roared in silent amusement beside dumbledore had a gleeful wild look about him his golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders harry wondered whether it was a young doge but before he could check the caption the door of the office opened 
 
 if thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered harry would not have had time to pull the invisibility cloak over himself as it was he thought thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still staring curiously at the place where harry had just vanished perhaps deciding that that all he had seen was dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book for harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot it sprang out and began scribbling a note to umbridge very slowly hardly daring to breathe harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond 
 
 the were still clustered around the remains of the decoy detonator which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said i bet it sneaked up here from experimental charms theyre so careless remember that poisonous duck 
 
 speeding back toward the lifts harry reviewed his options it had never been likely that the locket was here at the ministry and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court their priority now had to be to leave the ministry before they were exposed and try again another day the first thing to do was to find ron and then they could work out a way of extracting hermione from the courtroom 
 
 the lift was empty when it arrived harry jumped in and pulled off the invisibility cloak as it started its descent to his enormous relief when it rattled to a halt at level two a and ron got in 
 
 he stammered to harry as the lift set off again 
 
 ron its me harry 
 
 harry blimey i forgot what you looked like c why isnt hermione with you 
 
 she had to go down to the courtrooms with umbridge she couldnt refuse and c 
 
 but before harry could finish the lift had stopped again the doors opened and mr weasley walked inside talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill 
 
 i quite understand what youre saying wakanda but im afraid i cannot be party to c 
 
 mr weasley broke off he had noticed harry it was very strange to have mr weasley glare at him with that much dislike the lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more 
 
 oh hello reg said mr weasley looking around at the sound of steady dripping from rons robes isnt your wife in for questioning today er c whats happened to you why are you so wet 
 
 yaxleys office is raining said ron he addressed mr weasleys shoulder and harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each others eyes i couldnt stop it so theyve sent me to get bernie c pillsworth i think they said c 
 
 yes a lot of offices have been raining lately said mr weasley did you try meterolojinx recanto it worked for bletchley 
 
 meteolojinx recanto whispered ron no i didnt thanks d c i mean thanks arthur 
 
 the lift doors opened the old witch with the anthill hair left and ron darted past her out of sight harry made to follow him but found his path blocked as percy weasley strode into the lift his nose buried in some papers he was reading 
 
 not until the doors had clanged shut again did percy realize he was in a lit with his father he glanced up saw mr weasley turned radish red and left the lift the moment the doors opened again for the second time harry tried to get out but this time found his way blocked by mr weasleys arm 
 
 one moment runcorn 
 
 the lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor mr weasley said i hear you had information about dirk cresswell 
 
 harry had the impression that mr weasleys anger was no less because of the brush with percy he decided his best chance was to act stupid 
 
 sorry he said 
 
 dont pretend runcorn said mr weasley fiercely you tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree didnt you 
 
 i c so what if i did said harry 
 
 so dirk cresswell is ten times the wizard you are said mr weasley quietly as the lift sank ever lower and if he survives azkaban youll have to answer to him not to mention his wife his sons and his friends c 
 
 arthur harry interrupted you know youre being tracked dont you 
 
 is that a threat runcorn said mr weasley loudly 
 
 no said harry its a fact theyre watching your every move c 
 
 the lift doors opened they had reached the atrium mr weasley gave harry a scathing look and swept from the lift harry stood there shaken he wished he was impersonating somebody other than runcorn the lift doors clanged shut 
 
 harry pulled out the invisibility cloak and put it back on he would try to extricate hermione on his own while ron was dealing with the raining office when the doors opened he stepped out into a stone passageway quite different from the and carpeted corridors above as the left rattled away again harry shivered slightly looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the department of mysteries 
 
 he set off his destination not the black door but the doorway he remembered on the left hand side which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers his mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them he still had a couple of decoy detonators but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door enter as runcorn and ask for a quick word with mafalda of course he did not know whether runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this and even if he managed it hermiones might trigger a search before they were clear of the ministry 
 
 lost in thought he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him as if he were descending into fog it was becoming colder and colder with every step he took a cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs and then he felt that stealing sense of despair or hopelessness filling him expanding inside him 
 
 dementors he thought 
 
 and as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene the dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall figures their faces completely hidden their ragged breathing the only sound in the place the petrified brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches most of them were hiding their faces in their hands perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors greedy mouths some were accompanied by families others sat alone the dementors were gliding up and down in front of them and the cold and the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid themselves upon harry like a curse 
 
 fight it he told himself but he knew that he could not conjure a patronus here without revealing himself instantly so he moved forward as silently as he could and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain but he forced himself to think of hermione and of ron who needed him 
 
 moving through the towering black figures was terrifying the eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed and he felt sure that they sensed him sensed perhaps a human presence that still had some hope some resilience 
 
 and then abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it 
 
 no no im im i tell you my father was a wizard he was look him up arkie alderton hes a well known broomstick designer look him up i tell you c get your hands off me get your hands off c 
 
 this is your final warning said umbridges soft voice magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the mans desperate screams if you struggle you will be subjected to the dementors kiss 
 
 the mans screams subsided but dry sobs echoed through the corridor 
 
 take him away said umbridge 
 
 two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom their rotting scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting they glided away down the corridor with him and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight 
 
 next c mary cattermole called umbridge 
 
 a small woman stood up she was trembling from head to foot her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes her face was completely bloodless as she passed the dementors harry saw her shudder 
 
 he did it instinctively without any sort of plan because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon as the door began to swing closed he slipped into the courtroom behind her 
 
 it was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic this one was much smaller though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well 
 
 there were more dementors in here casting their freezing aura over the place they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform here behind a balustrade sat umbridge with yaxley on one side of her and hermione quite as as mrs cattermole on the other at the foot of the platform a cat prowled up and down up and down and harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors that was for the accused to feel not the accusers 
 
 sit down said umbridge in her soft silky voice 
 
 mrs cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform the moment she had sat down chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there 
 
 you are mary elizabeth cattermole asked umbridge 
 
 mrs cattermole gave a single shaky nod 
 
 married to reginald cattermole of the magical maintenance department 
 
 mrs cattermole burst into tears 
 
 i dont know where he is he was supposed to meet me here 
 
 umbridge ignored her 
 
 mother to maisie ellie and alfred cattermole 
 
 mrs cattermole sobbed harder than ever 
 
 theyre frightened they think that i might not come home c 
 
 spare us spat yaxley the brats of mudbloods do not stir our sympathies 
 
 mrs cattermoles sobs masked harrys footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform the moment he had passed the place where the patronus cat patrolled he felt the change in temperature it was warm and comfortable here the patronus he was sure was umbridges and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here in her element upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind umbridge yaxley and hermione taking a seat behind the latter he was worried about making hermione jump he thought of casting the muffliato charm upon umbridge and yaxley but even murmuring the word might cause hermione alarm then umbridge raised her voice to address mrs cattermole and harry seized his chance 
 
 im behind you he whispered into hermiones ear 
 
 as he had expected she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview but both umbridge and yaxley were concentrating upon mrs cattermole and this went unnoticed 
 
 a wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the ministry today mrs cattermole umbridge was saying inches cherry core do you recognize the description 
 
 mrs cattermole nodded mopping her eyes on her sleeve 
 
 could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand 
 
 sobbed mrs cattermole i didnt it from anybody i it when i was eleven years old it c it c it c chose me 
 
 she cried harder than ever 
 
 umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made harry want to attack her she leaned forward over the barrier the better to observe her victim and something gold swung forward too and dangled over the void the locket 
 
 hermione had seen it she let out a little squeak but umbridge and yaxley still intent upon their prey were deaf to everything else 
 
 no said umbridge no i dont think so mrs cattermole wands only choose witches or wizards you are not a witch i have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here c mafalda pass them to me 
 
 umbridge held out a small hand she looked so toadlike at that moment that harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers hermiones hands were shaking with shock she fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with mrs cattermoles name on it 
 
 thats c thats pretty dolores she said pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of umbridges blouse 
 
 what snapped umbridge glancing down oh yes c an old family heirloom she said patting the locket lying on her large bosom the s stands for selwyn i am related to the selwyns indeed there are few families to whom i am not related a pity she continued in a louder voice flicking through mrs cattermoles questionnaire that the same cannot be said for you parents professions greengrocers 
 
 yaxley laughed jeeringly below the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down and the dementors stood waiting in the corners 
 
 it was umbridges lie that brought the blood surging into harrys brain and obliterated his sense of caution c that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own credentials he raised his wand not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the invisibility cloak and said stupefy 
 
 there was a flash of red light umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade mrs cattermoles papers slid off her lap onto the floor and down below the prowling silver cat vanished air hit them like an oncoming wind yaxley confused looked around for the source of the trouble and saw harrys disembodied hand and wand pointing at him he tried to draw his own wand but too late stupefy 
 
 yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor 
 
 harry 
 
 hermione if you think i was going to sit here and let her pretend c 
 
 harry mrs cattermole 
 
 harry whirled around throwing off the invisibility cloak down below the dementors had moved out of their corners they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair whether because the patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control they seemed to have abandoned restraint mrs cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 the silver stag soared from the tip of harrys wand and leaped toward the dementors which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again the stags light more powerful and more warming than the cats protection filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room 
 
 get the horcrux harry told hermione 
 
 he ran back down the steps stuffing the invisibility cloak into his back and approached mrs cattermole 
 
 you she whispered gazing into his face but c but reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning 
 
 did i muttered harry tugging at the chains binding her arms well ive had a change of heart diffindo nothing happened hermione how do i get rid of these chains 
 
 wait im trying something up here c 
 
 hermione were surrounded by dementors 
 
 i know that harry but if she wakes up and the lockets gone c i need to duplicate it c geminio there that should fool her 
 
 hermione came running downstairs 
 
 lets see relashio 
 
 the chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair mrs cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before 
 
 i dont understand she whispered 
 
 youre going to leave here with us said harry pulling her to her feet go home grab your children and get out get out of the country if youve got to disguise yourselves and run youve seen how it is you wont get anything like a fair hearing here 
 
 harry said hermione how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door 
 
 patronuses said harry pointing his wand at his own the stag slowed and walked still gleaming brightly toward the door as many as we can muster do yours hermione 
 
 expec c expecto patronum said hermione nothing happened 
 
 its the only spell she ever has trouble with harry told a completely bemused mrs cattermole bit unfortunate really come on hermione 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 a silver otter burst from the end of hermiones wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag 
 
 cmon said harry and he led hermione and mrs cattermole to the door 
 
 when the patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside harry looked around the dementors were falling back on both sides of them melding into the darkness scattering before the silver creatures 
 
 its been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families harry told the waiting who were dazzled by the light of the patronuses and still cowering slightly go abroad if you can just get well away from the ministry thats the c er c new official position now if youll just follow the patronuses youll be able to leave the atrium 
 
 they managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted but as they approached the lifts harry started to have misgivings if they emerged into the atrium with a silver stag and otter soaring alongside it and twenty or so people half of them accused he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention he had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them 
 
 reg screamed mrs cattermole and she threw herself into rons arms runcorn let me out he attacked umbridge and yaxley and hes told all of us to leave the country i think wed better do it reg i really do lets hurry home and fetch the children and c why are you so wet 
 
 water muttered ron disengaging himself harry they know there are intruders inside the ministry something about a hole in umbridges office door i reckon weve got five minutes if that c 
 
 hermiones patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to harry 
 
 harry if were trapped here c 
 
 we wont be if we move fast said harry he addressed the silent group behind them who were all gawping at him 
 
 whos got wands 
 
 about half of them raised their hands 
 
 okay all of you who havent got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has well need to be fast before they stop us come on 
 
 they managed to cram themselves into two lifts harrys patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise 
 
 level eight said the witchs cool voice atrium 
 
 harry knew at once that they were in trouble the atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace sealing them off 
 
 harry squeaked hermione what are we going to c 
 
 stop harry thundered and the powerful voice of runcorn echoed through the atrium the wizards sealing the fireplaces froze follow me he whispered to the group of terrified who moved forward in a huddle shepherded by ron and hermione 
 
 whats up albert said the same balding wizard who had followed harry out of the fireplace earlier he looked nervous 
 
 this lot need to leave before you seal the exits said harry with all the authority he could muster 
 
 the group of wizards in front of him looked at one another 
 
 weve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone c 
 
 are you contradicting me harry blustered would you like me to have your family tree examined like i had dirk cresswells 
 
 sorry gasped the balding wizard backing away i didnt mean nothing albert but i thought i thought they were in for questioning and 
 
 their blood is pure said harry and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall purer than many of yours i daresay off you go he boomed to the who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs the ministry wizards hung back some looking confused others scared and fearful then 
 
 mary 
 
 mrs cattermole looked over her shoulder the real reg cattermole no longer vomiting but pale and wan had just come running out of a lift 
 
 r reg 
 
 she looked from her husband to ron who swore loudly 
 
 the balding wizard gaped his head turning ludicrously from one reg cattermole to the other 
 
 hey c whats going on what is this 
 
 seal the exit seal it 
 
 yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the but mrs cattermole had now vanished as the balding wizard lifted his wand harry raised an enormous fist and punched him sending him flying through the air 
 
 hes been helping escape yaxley harry shouted 
 
 the balding wizards colleagues set up and uproar under cover of which ron grabbed mrs cattermole pulled her into the fireplace and disappeared confused yaxley looked from harry to the punched wizard while the real reg cattermole screamed my wife who was that with my wife whats going on 
 
 harry saw yaxleys head turn saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face 
 
 come on harry shouted at hermione he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as yaxleys curse sailed over harrys head they spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle harry flung open the door ron was standing there beside the sinks still wrestling with mrs cattermole 
 
 reg i dont understand c 
 
 let go im not your husband youve got to go home 
 
 there was a noise in the cubicle behind them harry looked around yaxley had just appeared 
 
 lets go harry yelled he seized hermione by the hand and ron by the arm and turned on the stop 
 
 darkness engulfed them along with the sensation of compressing hands but something was wrong hermiones hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip 
 
 he wondered whether he was going to suffocate he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were rons arm and hermiones fingers which were slowly slipping away 
 
 and then he saw the door to number twelve grimmauld place with its serpent door knocker but before he could draw breath there was a scream and a flash of purple light hermiones hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 grandmother 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 grandmother is very old her face is wrinkled and her hair is 
 quite white but her eyes are like two stars and they have a mild 
 gentle expression in them when they look at you which does you 
 good she wears a dress of heavy rich silk with large flowers worked on it and it rustles when she moves and then she can tell the most wonderful stories grandmother knows a great deal for she was alive before father and mother quite certain she has a with large silver clasps in which she often reads and in the book between the leaves lies a rose quite flat and dry it is not so 
 pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass and yet she 
 smiles at it most pleasantly and tears even come into her eyes i 
 wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book 
 that way do you know why when tears fall upon the rose and she is looking at it the rose revives and fills the room 
 with its fragrance the walls vanish as in a mist and all around 
 her is the glorious green wood where in summer the sunlight streams 
 through thick foliage and grandmother why she is young again a 
 charming maiden fresh as a rose with round rosy cheeks fair 
 bright ringlets and a figure pretty and graceful but the eyes those 
 mild saintly eyes are the same they have been left to grandmother 
 at her side sits a young man tall and strong he gives her a rose and 
 she smiles grandmother cannot smile like that now yes she is 
 smiling at the memory of that day and many thoughts and recollections of the past but the handsome young man is gone and the rose has withered in the old book and grandmother is sitting there again an old woman looking down upon the withered rose in the book 
 grandmother is dead now she had been sitting in her 
 telling us a long beautiful tale and when it was finished she 
 said she was tired and leaned her head back to sleep awhile we could hear her gentle breathing as she slept gradually it became quieter and calmer and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace it was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine she smiled once more and then people said she was dead she was laid in a black coffin looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen though her eyes were closed but every wrinkle had vanished her hair looked white and silvery and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile 
 
 we did not feel at all afraid to look at the corpse of her who had 
 been such a dear good grandmother the in which the rose still lay was placed under her head for so she had wished it and then they buried grandmother 
 
 on the grave close by the churchyard wall they planted a 
 it was soon full of roses and the nightingale sat among 
 the flowers and sang over the grave from the organ in the church 
 sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms which were 
 written in the old book under the head of the dead one 
 
 the moon shone down upon the grave but the dead was not there 
 every child could go safely even at night and pluck a rose from 
 the tree by the churchyard wall the dead know more than we do who are living they know what a terror would come upon us if such a strange thing were to happen as the appearance of a dead person among us 
 
 they are better off than we are the dead return no more the earth 
 has been heaped on the coffin and it is earth only that lies within 
 it the leaves of the are dust and the rose with all its 
 recollections has crumbled to dust also but over the grave fresh 
 roses bloom the nightingale sings and the organ sounds and there 
 still lives a remembrance of old grandmother with the loving 
 gentle eyes that always looked young eyes can never die ours will 
 once again behold dear grandmother young and beautiful as when for the first time she kissed the fresh red rose that is now dust in 
 the grave

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter i 
 
 which treats of the manner of entering a convent 
 it was into this house that jean valjean had as fauchelevent expressed it fallen from the sky 
 he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue polonceau 
 that hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night was the nuns chanting matins that hall of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom was the chapel that phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation that bell the sound of which had so strangely surprised him was the bell attached to the knee of father fauchelevent 
 cosette once put to bed jean valjean and fauchelevent had as we have already seen supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good crackling fire then the only bed in the hut being occupied by cosette each threw himself on a truss of straw 
 before he shut his eyes jean valjean said 
 i must remain here henceforth 
 this remark trotted through head all night long 
 to tell the truth neither of them slept 
 jean valjean feeling that he was discovered and that javert was on his scent understood that he and cosette were lost if they returned to paris 
 then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister 
 jean valjean had henceforth but one thought to remain there 
 now for an unfortunate man in his position this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places the most dangerous because as no men might enter there if he were discovered it was a flagrant offence and jean valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison the safest because if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there who would ever seek him in such a place to dwell in an impossible place was safety 
 on his side fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains 
 he began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter how had m madeleine got there when the walls were what they were cloister walls are not to be stepped over 
 how did he get there with a child 
 one cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in arms 
 who was that child 
 where did they both come from since fauchelevent had lived in the convent he had heard nothing of m sur m and he knew nothing of what had taken place there father madeleine had an air which discouraged questions and besides fauchelevent said to himself 
 one does not question a saint m madeleine had preserved all his prestige in eyes only from some words which jean valjean had let fall the gardener thought he could draw the inference that m madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times and that he was pursued by his creditors or that he had compromised himself in some political affair and was in hiding which last did not displease fauchelevent who like many of our peasants of the north had an old fund of bonapartism about him while in hiding m madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there but the inexplicable point to which fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain was that m madeleine should be there and that he should have that little girl with him fauchelevent saw them touched them spoke to them and still did not believe it possible 
 the incomprehensible had just made its entrance into hut 
 fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures and could see nothing clearly but this m madeleine saved my life 
 this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course 
 he said to himself 
 it is my turn now he added in his conscience 
 m madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out 
 he made up his mind to save m madeleine 
 nevertheless he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies 
 after what he did for me would i save him if he were a thief 
 just the same 
 if he were an assassin would i save him 
 just the same 
 since he is a saint shall i save him just the same 
 but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his his good will and a little of that old rustic cunning on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister and the steep escarpments of the rule of father fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who towards the end of his days halt infirm with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grateful and perceiving a generous action to be performed flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment when he is dying should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted and should swallow it with avidity we may add that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him 
 so he took his resolve 
 to devote himself to m madeleine 
 we have just called him a poor peasant of picardy 
 that description is just but incomplete 
 at the point of this story which we have now reached a little of father physiology becomes useful 
 he was a peasant but he had been a notary which added trickery to his cunning and penetration to his ingenuousness having through various causes failed in his business he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer 
 but in spite of oaths and lashings which horses seem to require something of the notary had lingered in him 
 he had some natural wit he talked good grammar he conversed which is a rare thing in a village and the other peasants said of him 
 he talks almost like a gentleman with a hat 
 fauchelevent belonged in fact to that species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the of the plebeian 
 rather rustic rather citified pepper and salt fauchelevent though sorely tried and harshly used by fate worn out a sort of poor threadbare old soul was nevertheless an impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked his defects and his vices for he had some were all superficial in short his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer 
 his aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify malice or stupidity 
 at daybreak father fauchelevent opened his eyes after having done an enormous deal of thinking and beheld m madeleine seated on his truss of straw and watching slumbers fauchelevent sat up and said 
 now that you are here how are you going to contrive to enter 
 this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his revery 
 the two men took counsel together 
 in the first place said fauchelevent you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber either you or the child one step in the garden and we are done for 
 that is true 
 monsieur madeleine resumed fauchelevent you have arrived at a very auspicious moment i mean to say a very inauspicious moment one of the ladies is very ill 
 this will prevent them from looking much in our direction 
 it seems that she is dying 
 the prayers of the forty hours are being said 
 the whole community is in confusion that occupies them 
 the one who is on the point of departure is a saint 
 in fact we are all saints here all the difference between them and me is that they say our cell and that i say my cabin 
 the prayers for the dying are to be said and then the prayers for the dead 
 we shall be at peace here for but i will not answer for 
 still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are trees it is not visible from the convent 
 and i add that the nuns never come near it 
 well said jean valjean 
 the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified it seems to me that one may remain concealed here 
 it was to this interrogation point that fauchelevent responded 
 there are the little girls 
 what little girls asked jean valjean 
 just as fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered a bell emitted one stroke 
 the nun is dead said he 
 there is the knell 
 and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen 
 the bell struck a second time 
 it is the knell monsieur madeleine 
 the bell will continue to strike once a minute for hours until the body is taken from the see they play 
 at recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside to send them all hither in spite of prohibitions to hunt and rummage for it all about here those cherubs are devils 
 who asked jean valjean 
 the little girls 
 you would be very quickly discovered they would shriek 
 oh a man 
 there is no danger there will be no recreation hour 
 the day will be entirely devoted to prayers 
 you hear the bell 
 as i told you a stroke each minute it is the death knell 
 i understand father fauchelevent 
 there are pupils 
 and jean valjean thought to himself 
 here is education already provided 
 fauchelevent exclaimed 
 pardine 
 there are little girls indeed 
 and they would bawl around you 
 and they would rush off 
 to be a man here is to have the plague 
 you see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though i were a wild beast 
 jean valjean fell into more and more profound convent would be our salvation he murmured 
 then he raised his voice 
 yes the difficulty is to remain here 
 no said fauchelevent the difficulty is to get out 
 jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart 
 to get out 
 yes monsieur madeleine 
 in order to return here it is first necessary to get out 
 and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded fauchelevent went on 
 you must not be found here in this fashion 
 whence come you for me you fall from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to enter by the door 
 all at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell 
 ah said fauchelevent they are ringing up the vocal mothers they are going to the chapter 
 they always hold a chapter when any one dies 
 she died at daybreak 
 people generally do die at daybreak but cannot you get out by the way in which you entered 
 come i do not ask for the sake of questioning you but how did you get in 
 jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder 
 you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither jean valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his collar javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps 
 impossible said he 
 father fauchelevent say that i fell from the sky 
 but i believe it i believe it retorted fauchelevent you have no need to tell me that 
 the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped you 
 only he meant to place you in a convent he made a mistake 
 come there goes another peal that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the is to come here and view a corpse 
 all that is the ceremony of dying these good ladies are not at all fond of that visit 
 a doctor is a man who does not believe in anything 
 he lifts the veil sometimes he lifts something else too 
 how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time 
 what is the matter 
 your little one is still asleep 
 what is her name 
 cosette 
 she is your daughter 
 you are her grandfather that is 
 yes 
 it will be easy enough for her to get out of here 
 i have my service door which opens on the courtyard 
 i knock 
 the porter opens i have my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out father fauchelevent goes out with his is perfectly natural you will tell the child to keep very quiet 
 she will be under the cover i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend a whom i know in the rue who is deaf and who has a little bed 
 i will shout in the ear that she is a niece of mine and that she is to keep her for me until then the little one will with you for i will contrive to have you it must be done but how will you manage to get out 
 jean valjean shook his head 
 no one must see me the whole point lies there father fauchelevent find some means of getting me out in a basket under cover like cosette 
 fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand a sign of serious embarrassment 
 a third peal created a diversion 
 that is the taking his departure said fauchelevent he has taken a look and said 
 she is dead that is well when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise the company sends a coffin 
 if it is a mother the mothers lay her out if she is a sister the sisters lay her out 
 after which i nail her up 
 that forms a part of my duty 
 a gardener is a bit of a she is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead 
 i count the men and myself as men 
 it is in that hall that i nail up the coffin the men come and get it and whip up coachman the way one goes to heaven 
 they fetch a box with nothing in it they take it away again with something in it 
 what a burial is like 
 de profundis 
 a horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light 
 jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her 
 he was no longer listening to fauchelevent 
 that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble 
 the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery 
 they declare that they are going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery 
 it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire 
 it is a shame for it is convenient i have a friend there father mestienne the the nuns here possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall 
 there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf 
 but how many events have happened since yesterday mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine 
 is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly 
 fauchelevent caught the word 
 goodness if you were here for good it would be a real burial 
 a fourth peal burst out 
 fauchelevent hastily detached the belled from its nail and buckled it on his knee again 
 this time it is for me 
 the mother prioress wants me 
 good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle 
 monsieur madeleine stir from here and wait for me 
 something new has come up if you are hungry there is wine bread and cheese 
 and he hastened out of the hut crying 
 coming coming 
 jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch 
 less than ten minutes later father fauchelevent whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice replied 
 forever 
 forever that is to say 
 enter 
 the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business 
 this parlor adjoined the chapter hall the prioress seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for fauchelevent

 fauchelevent belonged in fact to that species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the of the plebeian 
 rather rustic rather citified pepper and salt fauchelevent though sorely tried and harshly used by fate worn out a sort of poor threadbare old soul was nevertheless an impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked his defects and his vices for he had some were all superficial in short his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer 
 his aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify malice or stupidity 
 at daybreak father fauchelevent opened his eyes after having done an enormous deal of thinking and beheld m madeleine seated on his truss of straw and watching slumbers fauchelevent sat up and said 
 now that you are here how are you going to contrive to enter 
 this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his revery 
 the two men took counsel together 
 in the first place said fauchelevent you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber either you or the child one step in the garden and we are done for 
 that is true 
 monsieur madeleine resumed fauchelevent you have arrived at a very auspicious moment i mean to say a very inauspicious moment one of the ladies is very ill 
 this will prevent them from looking much in our direction 
 it seems that she is dying 
 the prayers of the forty hours are being said 
 the whole community is in confusion that occupies them 
 the one who is on the point of departure is a saint 
 in fact we are all saints here all the difference between them and me is that they say our cell and that i say my cabin 
 the prayers for the dying are to be said and then the prayers for the dead 
 we shall be at peace here for but i will not answer for 
 still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are trees it is not visible from the convent 
 and i add that the nuns never come near it 
 well said jean valjean 
 the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified it seems to me that one may remain concealed here 
 it was to this interrogation point that fauchelevent responded 
 there are the little girls 
 what little girls asked jean valjean 
 just as fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered a bell emitted one stroke 
 the nun is dead said he 
 there is the knell 
 and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen 
 the bell struck a second time 
 it is the knell monsieur madeleine 
 the bell will continue to strike once a minute for hours until the body is taken from the see they play 
 at recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside to send them all hither in spite of prohibitions to hunt and rummage for it all about here those cherubs are devils 
 who asked jean valjean 
 the little girls 
 you would be very quickly discovered they would shriek 
 oh a man 
 there is no danger there will be no recreation hour 
 the day will be entirely devoted to prayers 
 you hear the bell 
 as i told you a stroke each minute it is the death knell 
 i understand father fauchelevent 
 there are pupils 
 and jean valjean thought to himself 
 here is education already provided 
 fauchelevent exclaimed 
 pardine 
 there are little girls indeed 
 and they would bawl around you 
 and they would rush off 
 to be a man here is to have the plague 
 you see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though i were a wild beast 
 jean valjean fell into more and more profound convent would be our salvation he murmured 
 then he raised his voice 
 yes the difficulty is to remain here 
 no said fauchelevent the difficulty is to get out 
 jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart 
 to get out 
 yes monsieur madeleine 
 in order to return here it is first necessary to get out 
 and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded fauchelevent went on 
 you must not be found here in this fashion 
 whence come you for me you fall from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to enter by the door 
 all at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell 
 ah said fauchelevent they are ringing up the vocal mothers they are going to the chapter 
 they always hold a chapter when any one dies 
 she died at daybreak 
 people generally do die at daybreak but cannot you get out by the way in which you entered 
 come i do not ask for the sake of questioning you but how did you get in 
 jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder 
 you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither jean valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his collar javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps 
 impossible said he 
 father fauchelevent say that i fell from the sky 
 but i believe it i believe it retorted fauchelevent you have no need to tell me that 
 the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped you 
 only he meant to place you in a convent he made a mistake 
 come there goes another peal that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the is to come here and view a corpse 
 all that is the ceremony of dying these good ladies are not at all fond of that visit 
 a doctor is a man who does not believe in anything 
 he lifts the veil sometimes he lifts something else too 
 how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time 
 what is the matter 
 your little one is still asleep 
 what is her name 
 cosette 
 she is your daughter 
 you are her grandfather that is 
 yes 
 it will be easy enough for her to get out of here 
 i have my service door which opens on the courtyard 
 i knock 
 the porter opens i have my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out father fauchelevent goes out with his is perfectly natural you will tell the child to keep very quiet 
 she will be under the cover i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend a whom i know in the rue who is deaf and who has a little bed 
 i will shout in the ear that she is a niece of mine and that she is to keep her for me until then the little one will with you for i will contrive to have you it must be done but how will you manage to get out 
 jean valjean shook his head 
 no one must see me the whole point lies there father fauchelevent find some means of getting me out in a basket under cover like cosette 
 fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand a sign of serious embarrassment 
 a third peal created a diversion 
 that is the taking his departure said fauchelevent he has taken a look and said 
 she is dead that is well when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise the company sends a coffin 
 if it is a mother the mothers lay her out if she is a sister the sisters lay her out 
 after which i nail her up 
 that forms a part of my duty 
 a gardener is a bit of a she is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead 
 i count the men and myself as men 
 it is in that hall that i nail up the coffin the men come and get it and whip up coachman the way one goes to heaven 
 they fetch a box with nothing in it they take it away again with something in it 
 what a burial is like 
 de profundis 
 a horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light 
 jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her 
 he was no longer listening to fauchelevent 
 that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble 
 the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery 
 they declare that they are going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery 
 it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire 
 it is a shame for it is convenient i have a friend there father mestienne the the nuns here possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall 
 there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf 
 but how many events have happened since yesterday mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine 
 is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly 
 fauchelevent caught the word 
 goodness if you were here for good it would be a real burial 
 a fourth peal burst out 
 fauchelevent hastily detached the belled from its nail and buckled it on his knee again 
 this time it is for me 
 the mother prioress wants me 
 good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle 
 monsieur madeleine stir from here and wait for me 
 something new has come up if you are hungry there is wine bread and cheese 
 and he hastened out of the hut crying 
 coming coming 
 jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch 
 less than ten minutes later father fauchelevent whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice replied 
 forever 
 forever that is to say 
 enter 
 the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business 
 this parlor adjoined the chapter hall the prioress seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for fauchelevent

 fauchelevent in the presence of a difficulty 
 
 it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuns to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions

 the gardener made a timid bow and remained at the door of the cell the prioress who was telling her beads raised her eyes and said 
 ah it is you father fauvent 
 this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent 
 fauchelevent bowed again 
 father fauvent i have sent for you 
 here i am reverend mother 
 i have something to say to you 
 and so have i said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror i have something to say to the very reverend mother 
 the prioress stared at him 
 ah you have a communication to make to me 
 a request 
 very well speak 
 goodman fauchelevent the belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance 
 a certain clever ignorance constitutes a force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent 
 always solitary and busied about his gardening he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity 
 as he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before him only an agitation of shadows by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh and those corpses were alive for him he was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute 
 he had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear fauchelevent knew all and concealed all that constituted his art the whole convent thought him stupid 
 a great merit in religion the vocal mothers made much of fauchelevent 
 he was a curious mute he inspired confidence 
 moreover he was regular and never went out except for requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden 
 this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit none the less he had set two men to chattering 
 the porter in the convent and he knew the singularities of their parlor and the at the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture in this way he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns one as to their life the other as to their death 
 but he did not abuse his knowledge the congregation thought a great deal of him 
 old lame blind to everything probably a little deaf into the qualities they would have found it difficult to replace him 
 the goodman with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress 
 he talked a long time about his age his infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demands of his work of the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds because of the moon and he wound up as follows that he had a prioress made a brother no longer second movement on the part of the prioress but one expressive of if he might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help him that he was an excellent gardener that the community would receive from him good service better than his own that otherwise if his brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged greatly to his regret to go away and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him who might be reared for god in the house and who might who knows become a nun some day

 chapter ix 
 
 christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn and wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though the calm frost of twenty degrees reaumur the dazzling sunshine by day and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special celebration of the season 
 on the third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning was asleep on the sofa the old count was resting in his study sonya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nastasya ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old ladies natasha came into the room went up to sonya glanced at what she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without speaking 
 why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother what do you want 
 him i want him now this minute i want him said natasha with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile 
 the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter 
 look at me mamma look i shall cry directly 
 sit down with me a little said the countess 
 mamma i want him why should i be wasted like this mamma 
 her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to hide them and left the room 
 she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then went into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from the serfs quarters 
 stop playing a time for everything said the old woman 
 let her alone kondratevna said natasha go mavrushka go 
 having released mavrushka natasha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule there an old footman and two young ones were playing cards they broke off and rose as she entered 
 what can i do with them thought natasha 
 oh nikita please go where can i send him yes go to the yard and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some oats 
 just a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily 
 go go quickly the old man urged him 
 and you theodore get me a piece of chalk 
 on her way past the pantry she told them to set a samovar though it was not at all the time for tea 
 foka the butler was the most person in the house natasha liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted 
 oh dear what a young lady said foka pretending to frown at natasha 
 no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as natasha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to send them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them would get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no orders so readily as they did hers what can i do where can i go thought she as she went slowly along the passage 
 nastasya ivanovna what sort of children shall i have she asked the buffoon who was coming toward her in a jacket 
 why fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoon 
 o lord o lord always the same oh where am i to go what am i to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story 
 two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which were plates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natasha sat down listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got up again 
 the island of madagascar she said she repeated articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to madame schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the room 
 her brother petya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night

 petya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting her arms round his neck and he pranced along with her 
 no the island of madagascar she said and jumping off his back she went downstairs 
 having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull natasha betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered she was in a mood for brooding on the past 
 sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand natasha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that she remembered the light failing through that crack once before and sonya passing with a glass in her hand yes it was exactly the same thought natasha 
 sonya what is this she cried twanging a thick string 
 oh you are there said sonya with a start and came near and listened i know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of being wrong 
 there just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before thought natasha and in just the same way i thought there was something lacking in her 
 no the chorus from the listen and natasha sang the air of the chorus so that sonya should catch it where were you going she asked 
 to change the water in this glass i am just finishing the design 
 you always find something to do but i said natasha and nicholas 
 asleep i think 
 sonya go and wake him said natasha tell him i want him to come and sing 
 she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened before could be and without solving this problem or at all regretting not having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him and he was looking at her with a eyes 
 oh if only he would come quicker i am so afraid it will never be and worst of all i am growing old the thing there then be in me what there is now but perhaps come today will come immediately perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room perhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose put down the guitar and went to the drawing room 
 all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already at the tea table the servants stood round the table but prince andrew was not there and life was going on as before 
 ah here she is said the old count when he saw natasha enter well sit down by me but natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something 
 mamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs 
 she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my god the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way thought natasha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the same 
 after tea nicholas sonya and natasha went to the sitting room to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began

 book seven 
 chapter ix 
 
 christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn and wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though the calm frost of twenty degrees reaumur the dazzling sunshine by day and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special celebration of the season 
 on the third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning was asleep on the sofa the old count was resting in his study sonya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nastasya ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old ladies natasha came into the room went up to sonya glanced at what she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without speaking 
 why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother what do you want 
 him i want him now this minute i want him said natasha with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile 
 the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter 
 look at me mamma look i shall cry directly 
 sit down with me a little said the countess 
 mamma i want him why should i be wasted like this mamma 
 her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to hide them and left the room 
 she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then went into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from the serfs quarters 
 stop playing a time for everything said the old woman 
 let her alone kondratevna said natasha go mavrushka go 
 having released mavrushka natasha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule there an old footman and two young ones were playing cards they broke off and rose as she entered 
 what can i do with them thought natasha 
 oh nikita please go where can i send him yes go to the yard and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some oats 
 just a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily 
 go go quickly the old man urged him 
 and you theodore get me a piece of chalk 
 on her way past the pantry she told them to set a samovar though it was not at all the time for tea 
 foka the butler was the most person in the house natasha liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted 
 oh dear what a young lady said foka pretending to frown at natasha 
 no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as natasha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to send them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them would get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no orders so readily as they did hers what can i do where can i go thought she as she went slowly along the passage 
 nastasya ivanovna what sort of children shall i have she asked the buffoon who was coming toward her in a jacket 
 why fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoon 
 o lord o lord always the same oh where am i to go what am i to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story 
 two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which were plates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natasha sat down listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got up again 
 the island of madagascar she said she repeated articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to madame schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the room 
 her brother petya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night 
 petya petya she called to him carry me downstairs 
 petya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting her arms round his neck and he pranced along with her 
 no the island of madagascar she said and jumping off his back she went downstairs 
 having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull natasha betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered she was in a mood for brooding on the past

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter iii 
 
 mother innocente 
 
 about a quarter of an hour elapsed 
 the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair 
 the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied 
 we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 do you know the chapel 
 i have a little cage there where i hear the mass and the offices 
 and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties 
 two or three times 
 there is a stone to be raised 
 heavy 
 the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar 
 the slab which closes the vault 
 yes 
 it would be a good thing to have two men for it 
 mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you 
 a woman is never a man 
 we have only a woman here to help you 
 each one does what he can because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlonus horstius only gives three hundred and i do not despise merlonus horstius 
 neither do i 
 merit consists in working according to strength 
 a cloister is not a 
 and a woman is not a man 
 but my brother is the strong one though 
 and can you get a lever 
 that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door 
 there is a ring in the stone 
 i will put the lever through it 
 and the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot 
 that is good reverend mother 
 i will open the vault 
 and the four mother precentors will help you 
 and when the vault is open 
 it must be closed again 
 will that be all 
 no 
 give me your orders very reverend mother 
 fauvent we have confidence in you 
 i am here to do anything you wish 
 and to hold your peace about everything 
 yes reverend mother 
 when the vault is open 
 i will close it again 
 but before that 
 what reverend mother 
 something must be lowered into it 
 a silence ensued 
 the prioress after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation broke it 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 you know that a mother died this morning 
 no 
 did you not hear the bell 
 nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden 
 really 
 i can hardly distinguish my own signal 
 she died at daybreak 
 and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning 
 it was mother crucifixion 
 a blessed woman 
 the prioress paused moved her lips as though in mental prayer and resumed 
 three years ago madame de bethune a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer 
 ah yes now i hear the knell reverend mother 
 the mothers have taken her to the which opens on the church 
 i know 
 no other man than you can or must enter that chamber 
 see to that a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the 
 more often 
 hey 
 more often 
 what do you say 
 i say more often 
 more often than what 
 reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often 
 i understand you 
 why do you say more often 
 in order to speak like you reverend mother 
 but i did not say more often 
 at that moment nine struck 
 at nine in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress 
 amen said fauchelevent 
 the clock struck opportunely 
 it cut more often short it is probable that had it not been for this the prioress and fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein 
 fauchelevent mopped his forehead 
 the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred then raised her voice 
 in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles 
 she will replied father fauchelevent falling into step and striving not to flinch again 
 father fauvent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion no doubt it is not granted to every one to die like cardinal de berulle while saying the holy mass and to breathe forth their souls to god while pronouncing these words 
 hanc igitur oblationem but without attaining to such happiness mother death was very precious 
 she retained her consciousness to the very last moment 
 she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels she gave us her last commands 
 if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it 
 she smiled 
 we felt that she was regaining her life in god 
 there was something of paradise in that death 
 fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing 
 amen said he 
 father fauvent what the dead wish must be done 
 the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet 
 fauchelevent held his peace 
 she went on 
 i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit 
 reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden 
 besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint 
 like yourself reverend mother 
 she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii 
 the one who crowned the 
 for a clever man like fauchelevent this allusion was an awkward one fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it 
 she continued 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 saint didorus archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb 
 acarus which signifies a worm of the earth this was done 
 is this true 
 yes reverend mother 
 the blessed mezzocane abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the gallows this was done 
 that is true 
 saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that would spit on his tomb 
 this was done the dead must be obeyed 
 so be it 
 the body of bernard guidonis born in france near was as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guidonis was bishop of tuy in spain 
 can the contrary be affirmed 
 for that matter no reverend mother 
 the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse 
 several beads of the chaplet were told off still in silence the prioress resumed 
 father fauvent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years 
 that is just 
 it is a continuation of her slumber 
 so i shall have to nail up that coffin 
 yes 
 and we are to reject the coffin 
 precisely 
 i am at the orders of the very reverend community 
 the four mother precentors will assist you 
 in nailing up the coffin 
 i do not need them 
 no in lowering the coffin 
 where 
 into the vault 
 what vault 
 under the altar 
 fauchelevent started 
 the vault under the altar 
 under the altar 
 but 
 you will have an iron bar 
 yes but 
 you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring 
 but 
 the dead must be obeyed 
 to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion 
 she asked it of us that is to say commanded us 
 but it is forbidden 
 forbidden by men enjoined by god 
 what if it became known 
 we have confidence in you 
 oh 
 i am a stone in your walls 
 the chapter assembled 
 the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin under our altar 
 think father fauvent if she were to work miracles here 
 what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs 
 but reverend mother if the agent of the sanitary commission 
 saint benoit ii in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine pogonatus 
 but the commissary of police 
 chonodemaire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar 
 but the inspector from the prefecture 
 the world is nothing in the presence of the cross 
 martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crux dum volvitur orbis 
 amen said fauchelevent who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin 
 any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long on the day when the rhetorician gymnastoras left his prison bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in he halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it 
 the prioress who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away 
 i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard 
 who was bernard the first abbot of clairvaux 
 fontaines in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth 
 his father was named tecelin and his mother alethe 
 he began at citeaux to end in clairvaux he was ordained abbot by the bishop of guillaume de champeaux he had seven hundred novices and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries he overthrew abeilard at the council of sens in and pierre de bruys and henry his disciple and another sort of erring spirits who were called the apostolics he confounded arnauld de brescia darted lightning at the monk raoul the murderer of the jews dominated the council of reims in caused the condemnation of gilbert de porea bishop of poitiers caused the condemnation of eon de arranged the disputes of princes enlightened king louis the young advised pope eugene iii regulated the temple preached the crusade performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime and as many as in one day 
 who was benoit 
 he was the patriarch of he was the second founder of the saintete claustrale he was the basil of the west 
 his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses kings queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years 
 on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department on one side saint benoit on the other the inspector of public ways the state the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the administration what do we know of all that there is not a chance who would not be indignant to see how we are treated 
 we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ 
 your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention god subordinated to the commissary of police such is the age silence fauvent 
 fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath the prioress continued 
 no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture 
 only fanatics and those in error deny it 
 we live in times of terrible confusion we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore 
 we are ignorant and impious 
 in this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi to the cross of jesus christ 
 louis xvi 
 was merely a king let us beware of god 
 there is no longer just nor unjust the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar de bus nevertheless cesar de bus is a man of blessed memory and voltaire one of unblessed memory 
 the last the cardinal de perigord did not even know that charles de gondren succeeded to berulle and francois bourgoin to gondren and senault to bourgoin and father to senault the name of father coton is known not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the oratorie but because he furnished henri iv the huguenot king with the material for an oath that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de sales is that he cheated at play 
 and then religion is attacked why 
 because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap was the brother of salone bishop of embrun and because both of them followed mommol 
 what has that to do with the question 
 does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar 
 they persecute the saints 
 they shut their eyes to the truth 
 darkness is the rule 
 the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind no one thinks of hell as a reality 
 oh how wicked people are by order of the king signifies by order of the revolution one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead 
 a holy death is prohibited 
 burial is a civil matter 
 this is horrible saint leo ii 
 wrote two special letters one to pierre notaire the other to the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the emperor 
 gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy the ancient magistracy agreed with him 
 in former times we had voices in the chapter even on matters of the day 
 the abbot of citeaux the general of the order was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy 
 we do what we please with our dead is not the body of saint benoit himself in france in the abbey of fleury called saint although he died in italy at on saturday the st of the month of march of the year 
 all this is incontestable 
 i abhor i hate priors i execrate heretics but i should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary 
 one has only to read arnoul wion gabriel bucelin trithemus maurolics and dom luc 
 the prioress took breath then turned to fauchelevent 
 is it settled father fauvent 
 it is settled reverend mother 
 we may depend on you 
 i will obey 
 that is well 
 i am entirely devoted to the convent 
 that is understood 
 you will close the coffin 
 the sisters will carry it to the chapel 
 the office for the dead will then be said then we shall return to the cloister 
 between eleven and midnight you will come with your iron bar 
 all will be done in the most profound secrecy 
 there will be in the chapel only the four mother precentors mother ascension and yourself 
 and the sister at the post 
 she will not turn round 
 but she will hear 
 she will not listen 
 besides what the cloister knows the world learns not 
 a pause ensued 
 the prioress went on 
 you will remove your bell 
 it is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence 
 reverend mother 
 what father fauvent 
 has the doctor for the dead paid his visit 
 he will pay it at four the peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung but you do not understand any of the peals 
 i pay no attention to any but my own 
 that is well father fauvent 
 reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required 
 where will you obtain it 
 where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden 
 about of an hour before midnight do not forget 
 reverend mother 
 what 
 if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you 
 a perfect turk 
 you will do it as speedily as possible 
 i cannot work very fast 
 i am infirm that is why i require an assistant 
 i limp 
 to limp is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing 
 the emperor henry ii who combated antipope gregory and benoit viii has two surnames the saint and the lame 
 two surtouts are a good thing murmured fauchelevent who really was a little hard of hearing 
 now that i think of it father fauvent let us give a whole hour to it 
 that is not too much 
 be near the principal altar with your iron bar at eleven the office begins at midnight everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that 
 i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders 
 i am to nail up the coffin 
 at eleven exactly i am to be in the chapel 
 the mother precentors will be there 
 mother ascension will be there 
 two men would be better 
 however never mind 
 i shall have my lever we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and we will close the vault again 
 after which there will be no trace of anything the government will have no suspicion 
 thus all has been arranged reverend mother 
 no 
 what else remains 
 the empty coffin remains 
 this produced a pause 
 fauchelevent meditated 
 the prioress meditated 
 what is to be done with that coffin father fauvent 
 it will be given to the earth 
 empty 
 another silence 
 fauchelevent made with his left hand that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject 
 reverend mother i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church and no one can enter there but myself and i will cover the coffin with the pall 
 yes but the bearers when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it 
 ah the de exclaimed fauchelevent 
 the prioress began to make the sign of the cross and looked fixedly at the gardener 
 the vil stuck fast in his throat 
 he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath 
 i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother 
 that will produce the effect of a corpse 
 you are right 
 earth that is the same thing as man 
 so you will manage the empty coffin 
 i will make that my special business 
 the face up to that moment troubled and clouded grew serene once more 
 she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him 
 fauchelevent went towards the door 
 as he was on the point of passing out the prioress raised her voice gently 
 i am pleased with you father fauvent bring your brother to me after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter

 father fauvent what the dead wish must be done 
 the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet 
 fauchelevent held his peace 
 she went on 
 i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit 
 reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden 
 besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint 
 like yourself reverend mother 
 she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii 
 the one who crowned the 
 for a clever man like fauchelevent this allusion was an awkward one fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it 
 she continued 
 father fauvent 
 reverend mother 
 saint didorus archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb 
 acarus which signifies a worm of the earth this was done 
 is this true 
 yes reverend mother 
 the blessed mezzocane abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the gallows this was done 
 that is true 
 saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that would spit on his tomb 
 this was done the dead must be obeyed 
 so be it 
 the body of bernard guidonis born in france near was as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guidonis was bishop of tuy in spain 
 can the contrary be affirmed 
 for that matter no reverend mother 
 the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse 
 several beads of the chaplet were told off still in silence the prioress resumed 
 father fauvent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years 
 that is just 
 it is a continuation of her slumber 
 so i shall have to nail up that coffin 
 yes 
 and we are to reject the coffin 
 precisely 
 i am at the orders of the very reverend community 
 the four mother precentors will assist you 
 in nailing up the coffin 
 i do not need them 
 no in lowering the coffin 
 where 
 into the vault 
 what vault 
 under the altar 
 fauchelevent started 
 the vault under the altar 
 under the altar 
 but 
 you will have an iron bar 
 yes but 
 you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring 
 but 
 the dead must be obeyed 
 to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion 
 she asked it of us that is to say commanded us 
 but it is forbidden 
 forbidden by men enjoined by god 
 what if it became known 
 we have confidence in you 
 oh 
 i am a stone in your walls 
 the chapter assembled 
 the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin under our altar 
 think father fauvent if she were to work miracles here 
 what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs 
 but reverend mother if the agent of the sanitary commission 
 saint benoit ii in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine pogonatus 
 but the commissary of police 
 chonodemaire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar 
 but the inspector from the prefecture 
 the world is nothing in the presence of the cross 
 martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crux dum volvitur orbis 
 amen said fauchelevent who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin 
 any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long on the day when the rhetorician gymnastoras left his prison bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in he halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it 
 the prioress who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away 
 i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard 
 who was bernard the first abbot of clairvaux 
 fontaines in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth 
 his father was named tecelin and his mother alethe 
 he began at citeaux to end in clairvaux he was ordained abbot by the bishop of guillaume de champeaux he had seven hundred novices and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries he overthrew abeilard at the council of sens in and pierre de bruys and henry his disciple and another sort of erring spirits who were called the apostolics he confounded arnauld de brescia darted lightning at the monk raoul the murderer of the jews dominated the council of reims in caused the condemnation of gilbert de porea bishop of poitiers caused the condemnation of eon de arranged the disputes of princes enlightened king louis the young advised pope eugene iii regulated the temple preached the crusade performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime and as many as in one day 
 who was benoit 
 he was the patriarch of he was the second founder of the saintete claustrale he was the basil of the west 
 his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses kings queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years 
 on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department on one side saint benoit on the other the inspector of public ways the state the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the administration what do we know of all that there is not a chance who would not be indignant to see how we are treated 
 we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ 
 your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention god subordinated to the commissary of police such is the age silence fauvent 
 fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath the prioress continued 
 no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture 
 only fanatics and those in error deny it 
 we live in times of terrible confusion we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore 
 we are ignorant and impious 
 in this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi to the cross of jesus christ 
 louis xvi 
 was merely a king let us beware of god 
 there is no longer just nor unjust the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar de bus nevertheless cesar de bus is a man of blessed memory and voltaire one of unblessed memory 
 the last the cardinal de perigord did not even know that charles de gondren succeeded to berulle and francois bourgoin to gondren and senault to bourgoin and father to senault the name of father coton is known not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the oratorie but because he furnished henri iv the huguenot king with the material for an oath that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de sales is that he cheated at play 
 and then religion is attacked why 
 because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap was the brother of salone bishop of embrun and because both of them followed mommol 
 what has that to do with the question 
 does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar 
 they persecute the saints 
 they shut their eyes to the truth 
 darkness is the rule 
 the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind no one thinks of hell as a reality 
 oh how wicked people are by order of the king signifies by order of the revolution one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead 
 a holy death is prohibited 
 burial is a civil matter 
 this is horrible saint leo ii 
 wrote two special letters one to pierre notaire the other to the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the emperor 
 gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy the ancient magistracy agreed with him 
 in former times we had voices in the chapter even on matters of the day 
 the abbot of citeaux the general of the order was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy 
 we do what we please with our dead is not the body of saint benoit himself in france in the abbey of fleury called saint although he died in italy at on saturday the st of the month of march of the year 
 all this is incontestable 
 i abhor i hate priors i execrate heretics but i should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary 
 one has only to read arnoul wion gabriel bucelin trithemus maurolics and dom luc 
 the prioress took breath then turned to fauchelevent 
 is it settled father fauvent 
 it is settled reverend mother 
 we may depend on you 
 i will obey 
 that is well 
 i am entirely devoted to the convent 
 that is understood 
 you will close the coffin 
 the sisters will carry it to the chapel 
 the office for the dead will then be said then we shall return to the cloister 
 between eleven and midnight you will come with your iron bar 
 all will be done in the most profound secrecy 
 there will be in the chapel only the four mother precentors mother ascension and yourself 
 and the sister at the post 
 she will not turn round 
 but she will hear 
 she will not listen 
 besides what the cloister knows the world learns not 
 a pause ensued 
 the prioress went on 
 you will remove your bell 
 it is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence 
 reverend mother 
 what father fauvent 
 has the doctor for the dead paid his visit 
 he will pay it at four the peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung but you do not understand any of the peals 
 i pay no attention to any but my own 
 that is well father fauvent 
 reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required 
 where will you obtain it 
 where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden 
 about of an hour before midnight do not forget 
 reverend mother 
 what 
 if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you 
 a perfect turk 
 you will do it as speedily as possible 
 i cannot work very fast 
 i am infirm that is why i require an assistant 
 i limp 
 to limp is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing 
 the emperor henry ii who combated antipope gregory and benoit viii has two surnames the saint and the lame 
 two surtouts are a good thing murmured fauchelevent who really was a little hard of hearing 
 now that i think of it father fauvent let us give a whole hour to it 
 that is not too much 
 be near the principal altar with your iron bar at eleven the office begins at midnight everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that 
 i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders 
 i am to nail up the coffin 
 at eleven exactly i am to be in the chapel 
 the mother precentors will be there 
 mother ascension will be there 
 two men would be better 
 however never mind 
 i shall have my lever we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and we will close the vault again 
 after which there will be no trace of anything the government will have no suspicion 
 thus all has been arranged reverend mother 
 no 
 what else remains 
 the empty coffin remains 
 this produced a pause 
 fauchelevent meditated 
 the prioress meditated 
 what is to be done with that coffin father fauvent 
 it will be given to the earth 
 empty 
 another silence 
 fauchelevent made with his left hand that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject 
 reverend mother i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church and no one can enter there but myself and i will cover the coffin with the pall 
 yes but the bearers when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it 
 ah the de exclaimed fauchelevent 
 the prioress began to make the sign of the cross and looked fixedly at the gardener 
 the vil stuck fast in his throat 
 he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath 
 i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother 
 that will produce the effect of a corpse 
 you are right 
 earth that is the same thing as man 
 so you will manage the empty coffin 
 i will make that my special business 
 the face up to that moment troubled and clouded grew serene once more 
 she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him 
 fauchelevent went towards the door 
 as he was on the point of passing out the prioress raised her voice gently 
 i am pleased with you father fauvent bring your brother to me after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter

 book seven 
 chapter x 
 
 does it ever happen to you said natasha to her brother when they settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come nothing that everything good is past and to feel not exactly dull but sad 
 i should think so he replied i have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die once in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music and suddenly i felt so depressed 
 oh yes i know i know i know natasha interrupted him when i was quite little that used to be so with me do you remember when i was punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat sobbing in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry for everyone for myself and for everyone and i was innocent that was the chief thing said natasha do you remember 
 i remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed to we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you do you remember 
 and do you remember natasha asked with a pensive smile how once long long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into the study that was in the old house and it was dark we went in and suddenly there stood 
 a negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course i remember even now i know whether there really was a negro or if we only dreamed it or were told about him 
 he was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked at us 
 sonya do you remember asked nicholas 
 yes yes i do remember something too sonya answered timidly 
 you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said natasha and they say there was no negro at all but you see you remember 
 of course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them 
 how strange it is as if it were a dream i like that 
 and do you remember how we rolled eggs in the ballroom and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that real or not do you remember what fun it was 
 yes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch 
 so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad memories of old age but poetic youthful ones those impressions of most distant past in which dreams and realities blend and they laughed with quiet enjoyment 
 sonya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared the same reminiscences 
 much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced she simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it 
 she only really took part when they recalled first arrival she told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up with cords 
 and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage said natasha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve it then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable 
 while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the sitting room 
 they have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper 
 it wanted petya tell them to take it away replied natasha 
 in the middle of their talk in the sitting room dimmler came in and went up to the harp that stood there in a corner he took off its cloth covering and the harp gave out a jarring sound 
 mr dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the old countess voice from the drawing room 
 dimmler struck a chord and turning to natasha nicholas and sonya remarked how quiet you young people are 
 yes philosophizing said natasha glancing round for a moment and then continuing the conversation they were now discussing dreams 
 dimmler began to play natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table took up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietly in her former place it was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else 
 do you know said natasha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas and sonya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world 
 that is metempsychosis said sonya who had always learned well and remembered everything the egyptians believed that our souls have lived in animals and will go back into animals again 
 no i believe we ever were in animals said natasha still in a whisper though the music had ceased but i am certain that we were angels somewhere there and have been here and that is why we remember 
 may i join you said dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat down by them 
 if we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas no that be 
 not lower who said we were lower how do i know what i was before natasha rejoined with conviction the soul is immortal well then if i shall always live i must have lived before lived for a whole eternity 
 yes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they 
 why is it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now today and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the day before 
 natasha now your turn sing me something they heard the countess say why are you sitting there like conspirators 
 mamma i at all want to replied natasha but all the same she rose 
 none of them not even the dimmler wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but natasha got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best natasha began to sing her favorite song 
 she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening the count from his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her and like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her sonya as she listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she thought of natasha and of her own youth and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natasha and prince andrew 
 dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with closed eyes 
 ah countess he said at last a european talent she has nothing to learn what softness tenderness and strength 
 ah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess not realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her that natasha had too much of something and that because of this she would not be happy before natasha had finished singing petya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrived 
 natasha stopped abruptly 
 idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time 
 nothing mamma really nothing only petya startled me she said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her 
 the mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turks innkeepers and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas games the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom smiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people had disappeared 
 half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt this was nicholas a turkish girl was petya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natasha and a circassian was sonya with mustache and eyebrows 
 after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere 
 nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to 
 no why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides you have room to turn round there if you must go go to the melyukovs 
 melyukova was a widow who with her family and their tutors and governesses lived three miles from the rostovs 
 right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly aroused dress up at once and go with them make pashette open her eyes 
 but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that if louisa ivanovna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies might go to the melyukovs sonya generally so timid and shy more urgently than anyone begging louisa ivanovna not to refuse 
 costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming everyone told her she looked very handsome and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa ivanovna consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow drove up to the porch 
 natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing from one to another grew stronger and stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to one another laughing and shouting 
 two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the old with a trotter from the orlov stud as shaft horse the fourth was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse nicholas in his old dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand 
 it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof 
 natasha sonya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas sleigh dimmler his wife and petya into the old and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs 
 you go ahead zakhar shouted nicholas to his coachman wishing for a chance to race past him 
 the old troyka with dimmler and his party started forward squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar and threw it up 
 nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others moved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one after the other 
 a track a lot of tracks rang out voice through the air 
 how light it is nicholas came voice 
 nicholas glanced round at sonya and bent down to see her face closer quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant in the moonlight 
 that used to be sonya thought he and looked at her closer and smiled 
 what is it nicholas 
 nothing said he and turned again to the horses 
 when they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh runners and cut up by hoofs the marks of which were visible in the moonlight the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking into a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from side to side moving his ears as if asking it time to begin now in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhar could be clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the shouts laughter and voices of the mummers 
 gee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip 
 it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled harder ever increasing their gallop that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop the other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required 
 nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river 
 where are we thought he the kosoy meadow i suppose but no this is something new never seen before this the kosoy meadow nor the demkin hill and heaven only knows what it is it is something new and enchanted well whatever it may be and shouting to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh 
 zakhar held back his horses and turned his face which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows 
 nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakhar stretching out his arms clucked his tongue and let his horses go 
 now look out master he cried 
 faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw ahead zakhar while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins 
 no you master he shouted 
 nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar the horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing the whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides 
 again checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars 
 zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the left thought nicholas are we getting to the melyukovs is this melyukovka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows what is happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is and he looked round in the sleigh 
 look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the strange pretty unfamiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and mustache 
 i think this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was madame schoss but perhaps not and this circassian with the mustache i know but i love her 
 you cold he asked 
 they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh behind shouted something probably something funny but they could not make out what he said 
 yes yes some voices answered laughing 
 but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and if this is really melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have come to melyukovka thought nicholas 
 it really was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces came running out to the porch carrying candles 
 who is it asked someone in the porch 
 the mummers from the i know by the horses replied some voices

 why is it hard to imagine eternity said natasha it is now today and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the day before 
 natasha now your turn sing me something they heard the countess say why are you sitting there like conspirators 
 mamma i at all want to replied natasha but all the same she rose 
 none of them not even the dimmler wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but natasha got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best natasha began to sing her favorite song 
 she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening the count from his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her and like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while mitenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her sonya as she listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she thought of natasha and of her own youth and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natasha and prince andrew 
 dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with closed eyes 
 ah countess he said at last a european talent she has nothing to learn what softness tenderness and strength 
 ah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess not realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her that natasha had too much of something and that because of this she would not be happy before natasha had finished singing petya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrived 
 natasha stopped abruptly 
 idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time 
 nothing mamma really nothing only petya startled me she said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her 
 the mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turks innkeepers and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas games the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom smiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people had disappeared 
 half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt this was nicholas a turkish girl was petya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natasha and a circassian was sonya with mustache and eyebrows 
 after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere 
 nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to 
 no why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides you have room to turn round there if you must go go to the melyukovs 
 melyukova was a widow who with her family and their tutors and governesses lived three miles from the rostovs 
 right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly aroused dress up at once and go with them make pashette open her eyes 
 but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that if louisa ivanovna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies might go to the melyukovs sonya generally so timid and shy more urgently than anyone begging louisa ivanovna not to refuse 
 costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming everyone told her she looked very handsome and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa ivanovna consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow drove up to the porch 
 natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing from one to another grew stronger and stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to one another laughing and shouting 
 two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the old with a trotter from the orlov stud as shaft horse the fourth was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse nicholas in his old dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand 
 it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof 
 natasha sonya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas sleigh dimmler his wife and petya into the old and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs 
 you go ahead zakhar shouted nicholas to his coachman wishing for a chance to race past him 
 the old troyka with dimmler and his party started forward squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar and threw it up 
 nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others moved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one after the other 
 a track a lot of tracks rang out voice through the air 
 how light it is nicholas came voice 
 nicholas glanced round at sonya and bent down to see her face closer quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant in the moonlight 
 that used to be sonya thought he and looked at her closer and smiled 
 what is it nicholas 
 nothing said he and turned again to the horses 
 when they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh runners and cut up by hoofs the marks of which were visible in the moonlight the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking into a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from side to side moving his ears as if asking it time to begin now in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhar could be clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the shouts laughter and voices of the mummers 
 gee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip 
 it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled harder ever increasing their gallop that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop the other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required 
 nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river 
 where are we thought he the kosoy meadow i suppose but no this is something new never seen before this the kosoy meadow nor the demkin hill and heaven only knows what it is it is something new and enchanted well whatever it may be and shouting to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh 
 zakhar held back his horses and turned his face which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows 
 nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakhar stretching out his arms clucked his tongue and let his horses go 
 now look out master he cried 
 faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw ahead zakhar while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins 
 no you master he shouted 
 nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar the horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing the whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides 
 again checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars 
 zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the left thought nicholas are we getting to the melyukovs is this melyukovka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows what is happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is and he looked round in the sleigh 
 look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the strange pretty unfamiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and mustache 
 i think this used to be natasha thought nicholas and that was madame schoss but perhaps not and this circassian with the mustache i know but i love her 
 you cold he asked 
 they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh behind shouted something probably something funny but they could not make out what he said 
 yes yes some voices answered laughing 
 but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and if this is really melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have come to melyukovka thought nicholas 
 it really was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces came running out to the porch carrying candles 
 who is it asked someone in the porch 
 the mummers from the i know by the horses replied some voices

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter iv 
 
 in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castillejo 
 
 the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a man they do not reach their goal very promptly 
 moreover fauchelevent was in a dilemma 
 he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden 
 cosette had waked up 
 jean valjean had placed her near the fire 
 at the moment when fauchelevent entered jean valjean was pointing out to her the basket on the wall and saying to her listen attentively to me my little cosette we must go away from this house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here 
 the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that 
 you will wait for me at a house i shall come to fetch you 
 obey and say nothing above all things unless you want madame thenardier to get you again 
 cosette nodded gravely 
 jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fauchelevent opening the door 
 well 
 everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out 
 where the difficulty lies 
 it is easy enough with the child 
 you will carry her out 
 and she will hold her tongue 
 i answer for that 
 but you father madeleine 
 and after a silence fraught with anxiety fauchelevent exclaimed 
 why get out as you came in 
 jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying impossible 
 fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean 
 there is another thing which bothers me 
 i have said that i would put earth in it 
 when i come to think it over the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing it do it will get displaced it will move about 
 the men will bear it you understand father madeleine the government will notice it 
 jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving 
 fauchelevent went on 
 how the are you going to get out 
 it must all be done by morning 
 it is that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you 
 then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community that it fell among his duties to take part in their burials that he nailed up the coffins and helped the at the cemetery that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel 
 that the police regulations forbade this but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased 
 that it was so much the worse for the government that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault and that by way of thanks the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil 
 that his brother was m madeleine and that his niece was cosette 
 that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery 
 but that he could not bring m madeleine in from the outside if m madeleine was not outside that that was the first problem 
 and then that there was another the empty coffin 
 what is that empty coffin asked jean valjean 
 fauchelevent replied 
 the coffin of the administration 
 what coffin 
 what administration 
 a nun dies 
 the municipal doctor comes and says a nun has died the government sends a coffin 
 the next day it sends a hearse and men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery the men will come and lift the coffin there will be nothing in it 
 put something in it 
 a corpse 
 i have none 
 no 
 what then 
 a living person 
 what person 
 me said jean valjean 
 fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair 
 you 
 why not 
 jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter 
 you know fauchelevent what you have said 
 mother crucifixion is dead 
 and i add 
 and father madeleine is buried 
 ah good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously 
 very seriously i must get out of this place 
 certainly 
 l have told you to find a basket and a cover for me also 
 well 
 the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth 
 in the first place it will be a white cloth 
 nuns are buried in white 
 let it be a white cloth then 
 you are not like other men father madeleine 
 to behold such devices which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him and mingle with what he called the petty course of life in the convent caused fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the rue would inspire in a 
 jean valjean went on 
 the problem is to get out of here without being seen 
 this offers the means 
 but give me some information in the first place how is it managed 
 where is this coffin 
 the empty one 
 yes 
 down stairs in what is called the it stands on two trestles under the pall 
 how long is the coffin 
 six feet 
 what is this 
 it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church 
 what church 
 the church in the street the church which any one can enter 
 have you the keys to those two doors 
 no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church 
 when does the porter open that door 
 only to allow the men to enter when they come to get the coffin 
 when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again 
 who nails up the coffin 
 i do 
 who spreads the pall over it 
 i do 
 are you alone 
 not another man except the police doctor can enter the that is even written on the wall 
 could you hide me in that room when every one is asleep 
 no but i could hide you in a small dark nook which opens on the where i keep my tools to use for burials and of which i have the key 
 at what time will the hearse come for the coffin 
 about three in the afternoon 
 the burial will take place at the vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall it is not very near 
 i will remain concealed in your all night and all the morning 
 and how about food 
 i shall be hungry 
 i will bring you something 
 you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two 
 fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his 
 but that is impossible 
 bah 
 impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank 
 what seemed unprecedented to fauchelevent was we repeat a simple matter to jean valjean 
 jean valjean had been in worse straits than this 
 any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him 
 an escape is a cure what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure 
 to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean gloomy talents 
 moreover a coffin containing a living expedient is also an imperial expedient 
 if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo this was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication 
 he had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of in this manner 
 fauchelevent who had recovered himself a little exclaimed 
 but how will you manage to breathe 
 i will breathe 
 in that box 
 the mere thought of it suffocates me 
 you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely 
 good 
 and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze 
 a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze 
 and jean valjean added 
 father fauchelevent we must come to a decision 
 i must either be caught here or accept this escape through the hearse 
 every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a door 
 who is there who has not said to a cat do come in 
 there are men who when an incident stands before them have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate the cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious 
 fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature 
 but jean coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself 
 he grumbled 
 well since there is no other means 
 jean valjean resumed 
 the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery 
 that is the very point that is not troublesome exclaimed fauchelevent if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave 
 the is a drunkard and a friend of mine 
 he is father mestienne 
 an old fellow of the old school 
 the puts the corpses in the grave and i put the in my pocket 
 i will tell you what will take place 
 they will arrive a little before dusk of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed the hearse will drive directly up to the grave 
 i shall follow that is my business 
 i shall have a hammer a chisel and some pincers in my pocket 
 the hearse halts the men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down 
 the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure 
 i am left alone with father mestienne he is my friend i tell you 
 one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober 
 if he is not drunk i shall say to him 
 come and drink a bout while the bon coing the good quince is open 
 i carry him off i get him drunk it does not take long to make father mestienne drunk he always has the beginning of it about lay him under the table i take his card so that i can get into the cemetery again and i return without him 
 then you have no longer any one but me to deal with 
 if he is drunk i shall say to him 
 be off i will do your work for you 
 off he goes and i drag you out of the hole 
 jean valjean held out his hand and fauchelevent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant 
 that is settled father fauchelevent 
 all will go well 
 provided nothing goes wrong thought fauchelevent 
 in that case it would be terrible

 chapter xi 
 
 pelageya danilovna melyukova a broadly built energetic woman wearing spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull they were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall when they heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule 
 hussars ladies witches clowns and bears after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted the clown dimmler and the lady nicholas started a dance surrounded by the screaming children the mummers covering their faces and disguising their voices bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room

 natasha the young melyukovs favorite disappeared with them into the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from behind the door ten minutes later all the young melyukovs joined the mummers 
 pelageya danilovna having given orders to clear the rooms for the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them it was not merely dimmler and the rostovs she failed to recognize she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late dressing gowns and uniforms which they had put on 
 and who is is this she asked her governess peering into the face of her own daughter dressed up as a i suppose it is one of the rostovs well mr hussar and what regiment do you serve in she asked natasha here hand some fruit jelly to the turk she ordered the butler who was handing things round not forbidden by his law

 my little sasha look at sasha she said 
 after russian country dances and chorus dances pelageya danilovna made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together 
 in an hour all the costumes were crumpled and disordered the corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring flushed and merry faces pelageya danilovna began to recognize the mummers admired their cleverly contrived costumes and particularly how they suited the young ladies and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom 
 now to tell fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening said an old maid who lived with the melyukovs during supper 
 why said the eldest melyukov girl 
 you go it takes courage

 tell what happened to the young lady said the second melyukov girl 
 well began the old maid a young lady once went out took a cock laid the table for two all properly and sat down after sitting a while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with harness bells she hears him coming he comes in just in the shape of a man like an officer comes in and sits down to table with her 
 ah ah screamed natasha rolling her eyes with horror 
 yes and how did he speak 
 yes like a man everything quite all right and he began persuading her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow but she got frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands then he caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just then 
 now why frighten them said pelageya danilovna 
 mamma you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter 
 and how does one do it in a barn inquired sonya 
 well say you went to the barn now and listened it depends on what you hear hammering and knocking bad but a sound of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that too 
 mamma tell us what happened to you in the barn 
 pelageya danilovna smiled 
 oh forgotten she replied but none of you would go 
 yes i will pelageya danilovna let me go said sonya 
 well why not if not afraid 
 louisa ivanovna may i asked sonya 
 whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or talking as now nicholas did not leave side and gazed at her with quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks to that mustache that he had fully learned to know her and really that evening sonya was brighter more animated and prettier than nicholas had ever seen her before 
 so what she is like what a fool i have been he thought gazing at her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile dimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen before 
 not afraid of anything said sonya may i go at once she got up 
 they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her head and shoulders and glanced at nicholas 
 what a darling that girl is thought he and what have i been thinking of till now 
 sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went hastily to the front porch saying he felt too hot the crowd of people really had made the house stuffy 
 outside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but even brighter than before the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed the sky was black and dreary while the earth was gay 
 i am a fool a fool what have i been waiting for thought nicholas and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and along the path that led to the back porch he knew sonya would pass that way halfway lay some piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path this path led to the barn the log walls of the barn and its roof that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden snapped with the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness 
 from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying straight straight along the path miss only look back 
 i am not afraid answered voice and along the path toward nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of feet in her thin shoes 
 sonya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces away when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had known and always slightly feared he was in a dress with tousled hair and a happy smile new to sonya she ran rapidly toward him 
 quite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloak that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sonya kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks 
 sonya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and then back again he by the front and she by the back porch

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter v 
 
 it is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal 
 
 on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an hearse ornamented with skulls and tears this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms a in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed 
 two men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse 
 behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along 
 the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery 
 the handle of a hammer the blade of a cold chisel and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible protruding from the pocket 
 the vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris 
 it had its peculiar usages just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door which old people in the quarter who clung tenaciously to ancient words still called the porte cavaliere and the porte pietonne the of the rue had obtained permission as we have already stated to be buried there in a corner apart and at night the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community 
 the being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline the gates of the paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a municipal regulation the vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest 
 the carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates adjoining a pavilion built by the architect perronet and inhabited by the of the cemetery 
 these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides 
 if any were delayed after that moment in the cemetery there was but one way for him to get out his card furnished by the department of public funerals a sort of was constructed in the window the dropped his card into this box the porter heard it fall pulled the rope and the small door opened 
 if the man had not his card he mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with his key the stepped out but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs 
 
 instead of porte cochere and porte batarde 
 
 this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration 
 it was suppressed a little later than 
 the cemetery of called the eastern cemetery succeeded to it and inherited that famous next to the vaugirard cemetery which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board and which formed an angle one side on the drinkers tables and the other on the tombs with this sign au bon coing 
 the vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery it was falling into disuse 
 dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it 
 the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard it hinted at poverty 
 if you please to be buried in is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany 
 it is recognized as elegant 
 the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure planted like an french garden 
 straight alleys box holly ancient tombs beneath aged and very tall grass in the evening it was tragic there 
 there were very lugubrious lines about it 
 the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the vaugirard cemetery the lame man who followed it was no other than fauchelevent 
 the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch 
 let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight 
 it is one of the faults which resemble a duty the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences 
 in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable 
 in the first place the rule as for the code we shall see 
 make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves 
 the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to god a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle 
 fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind 
 his twin plots the one with the nuns the one for the convent the other against it the other with m madeleine had succeeded to all appearance 
 jean composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success 
 what remained to be done was a mere nothing 
 within the last two years he had made good father mestienne a person drunk at least ten times 
 he played with father mestienne 
 he did what he liked with him 
 he made him dance according to his whim head adjusted itself to the cap of will confidence was perfect 
 at the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse and said half aloud as he rubbed his big hands 
 a fine farce 
 all at once the hearse halted it had reached the gate 
 the permission for interment must be exhibited 
 the man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery 
 during this colloquy which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes some one a stranger came and placed himself behind the hearse beside fauchelevent 
 he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm 
 fauchelevent surveyed this stranger 
 who are you he demanded 
 the man replied 
 the 
 if a man could survive the blow of a full in the breast he would make the same face that fauchelevent made 
 the 
 yes 
 you 
 i 
 father mestienne is the 
 he was 
 what 
 he was 
 he is dead 
 fauchelevent had expected anything but this that a could die 
 it is true nevertheless that do die themselves 
 by dint of excavating graves for other people one hollows out own 
 fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open 
 he had hardly the strength to stammer 
 but it is not possible 
 it is so 
 but he persisted feebly father mestienne is the 
 after napoleon louis xviii 
 after mestienne gribier peasant my name is gribier 
 fauchelevent who was deadly pale stared at this gribier 
 he was a tall thin livid utterly funereal man 
 he had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned 
 fauchelevent burst out laughing 
 ah said he what queer things do happen 
 father mestienne is dead but long live little father lenoir 
 do you know who little father lenoir is 
 he is a jug of red wine 
 it is a jug of surene morbigou of real paris surene 
 ah 
 so old mestienne is dead i am sorry for it he was a jolly fellow 
 but you are a jolly fellow too 
 are you not comrade 
 go and have a drink together presently 
 the man replied 
 i have been a student 
 i passed my fourth examination i never drink 
 the hearse had set out again and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery 
 fauchelevent had slackened his pace 
 he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity 
 the walked on in front of him 
 fauchelevent passed the unexpected gribier once more in review 
 he was one of those men who though very young have the air of age and who though slender are extremely strong 
 comrade cried fauchelevent 
 the man turned round 
 i am the convent 
 my colleague said the man 
 fauchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered 
 so father mestienne is dead 
 the man replied 
 completely 
 the good god consulted his which shows when the time is up 
 it was father turn 
 father mestienne died 
 fauchelevent repeated mechanically 
 the good god 
 the good god said the man authoritatively 
 according to the philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme being 
 shall we not make each acquaintance stammered fauchelevent 
 it is made 
 you are a peasant i am a parisian 
 people do not know each other until they have drunk together he who empties his glass empties his heart 
 you must come and have a drink with me 
 such a thing cannot be refused 
 business first 
 fauchelevent thought 
 i am lost 
 they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns corner 
 the resumed 
 peasant i have seven small children who must be fed 
 as they must eat i cannot drink 
 and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well 
 their hunger is the enemy of my thirst 
 the hearse skirted a clump of quitted the grand alley turned into a narrow one entered the waste land and plunged into a thicket 
 this indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture 
 fauchelevent slackened his pace but he could not detain the hearse 
 fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed 
 he approached the 
 they have such a nice little argenteuil wine murmured fauchelevent 
 villager retorted the man i ought not be a my father was a porter at the prytaneum he destined me for literature 
 but he had reverses 
 he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author 
 but i am still a public writer 
 so you are not a then returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was 
 the one does not hinder the other 
 i cumulate 
 fauchelevent did not understand this last word 
 come have a drink said he 
 here a remark becomes necessary 
 fauchelevent whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay 
 generally fauchelevent offered and father mestienne paid an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new and it was necessary to make this offer but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark and that not unintentionally as for himself fauchelevent did not wish to pay troubled as he was 
 the went on with a superior smile 
 one must eat 
 i have accepted father reversion one gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes 
 to the labor of the hand i join the labor of the arm i have my stall in the market of the rue de sevres you know the umbrella market 
 all the cooks of the red cross apply to me 
 i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers in the morning i write love letters in the evening i dig graves such is life rustic 
 the hearse was still advancing 
 fauchelevent uneasy to the last degree was gazing about him on all sides 
 great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow 
 but continued the a man cannot serve two mistresses i must choose between the pen and the mattock 
 the mattock is ruining my hand 
 the hearse halted 
 the choir boy alighted from the then the priest 
 one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible 
 what a farce this is repeated fauchelevent in consternation

 father mestienne died 
 fauchelevent repeated mechanically 
 the good god 
 the good god said the man authoritatively 
 according to the philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme being 
 shall we not make each acquaintance stammered fauchelevent 
 it is made 
 you are a peasant i am a parisian 
 people do not know each other until they have drunk together he who empties his glass empties his heart 
 you must come and have a drink with me 
 such a thing cannot be refused 
 business first 
 fauchelevent thought 
 i am lost 
 they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns corner 
 the resumed 
 peasant i have seven small children who must be fed 
 as they must eat i cannot drink 
 and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well 
 their hunger is the enemy of my thirst 
 the hearse skirted a clump of quitted the grand alley turned into a narrow one entered the waste land and plunged into a thicket 
 this indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture 
 fauchelevent slackened his pace but he could not detain the hearse 
 fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed 
 he approached the 
 they have such a nice little argenteuil wine murmured fauchelevent 
 villager retorted the man i ought not be a my father was a porter at the prytaneum he destined me for literature 
 but he had reverses 
 he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author 
 but i am still a public writer 
 so you are not a then returned fauchelevent clutching at this branch feeble as it was 
 the one does not hinder the other 
 i cumulate 
 fauchelevent did not understand this last word 
 come have a drink said he 
 here a remark becomes necessary 
 fauchelevent whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay 
 generally fauchelevent offered and father mestienne paid an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new and it was necessary to make this offer but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark and that not unintentionally as for himself fauchelevent did not wish to pay troubled as he was 
 the went on with a superior smile 
 one must eat 
 i have accepted father reversion one gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes 
 to the labor of the hand i join the labor of the arm i have my stall in the market of the rue de sevres you know the umbrella market 
 all the cooks of the red cross apply to me 
 i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers in the morning i write love letters in the evening i dig graves such is life rustic 
 the hearse was still advancing 
 fauchelevent uneasy to the last degree was gazing about him on all sides 
 great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow 
 but continued the a man cannot serve two mistresses i must choose between the pen and the mattock 
 the mattock is ruining my hand 
 the hearse halted 
 the choir boy alighted from the then the priest 
 one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible 
 what a farce this is repeated fauchelevent in consternation

 when they all drove back from pelageya natasha who always saw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss should go back in the sleigh with dimmler and sonya with nicholas and the maids 
 on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic light into face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again he looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new sonya and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in fairyland 
 sonya is it well with thee he asked from time to time 
 yes she replied and with thee 
 when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a moment to sleigh and stood on its wing 
 natasha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my mind about sonya 
 have you told her asked natasha suddenly beaming all over with joy 
 oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows natasha are you glad 
 i am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did not tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she has nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy while sonya was not continued natasha now i am so glad well run back to her 
 no wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before natasha magical it 
 yes she replied you have done splendidly 
 had i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me and all would have been well 
 so you are glad and i have done right 
 oh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing i nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of sonya for there is nothing but good in her 
 then all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the expression of his face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped down and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the same happy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that circassian was sonya and that sonya was certainly his future happy and loving wife 
 when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the melyukovs the girls went to their bedroom when they had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a long time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would live when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how happy they would be on table stood two looking glasses which dunyasha had prepared beforehand 
 only when will all that be i am afraid never it would be too good said natasha rising and going to the looking glasses 
 sit down natasha perhaps see him said sonya 
 natasha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking glasses and sat down 
 i see someone with a mustache said natasha seeing her own face 
 you laugh miss said dunyasha 
 with help and the natasha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from tales she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew in that last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothing she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses 
 why is it others see things and i she said you sit down now sonya you absolutely must tonight do it for me today i feel so frightened 
 sonya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began looking 
 now miss sonya is sure to see something whispered dunyasha while you do nothing but laugh 
 sonya heard this and whisper 
 i know she will she saw something last year 
 for about three minutes all were silent 
 of course she will whispered natasha but did not finish suddenly sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her hand 
 oh natasha she cried 
 did you see did you what was it exclaimed natasha holding up the looking glass 
 sonya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to get up when she heard natasha say of course she will she did not wish to disappoint either dunyasha or natasha but it was hard to sit still she did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes 
 you saw him urged natasha seizing her hand 
 yes wait a bit i saw him sonya could not help saying not yet knowing whom natasha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew 
 but why i say i saw something others do see besides who can tell whether i saw anything or not flashed through mind 
 yes i saw him she said 
 how standing or lying 
 no i saw at first there was nothing then i saw him lying down 
 andrew lying is he ill asked natasha her frightened eyes fixed on her friend 
 no on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and he turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really seen what she described 
 well and then sonya 
 after that i could not make out what there was something blue and red 
 sonya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how afraid i am for him and for myself and about everything natasha began and without replying to words of comfort she got into bed and long after her candle was out lay and motionless gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes

 between four planks 
 who was in the coffin 
 the reader knows 
 jean valjean 
 jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there and he could almost breathe 
 it is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest 
 every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progressing and progressing favorably since the preceding day 
 he like fauchelevent counted on father mestienne 
 he had no doubt as to the end 
 never was there a more critical situation never more complete composure 
 the four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace it seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into jean tranquillity 
 from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow and he had followed all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death 
 shortly after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank jean valjean had felt himself carried out then driven off 
 he knew from the diminution in the jolting when they left the pavements and reached the earth road 
 he had divined from a dull noise that they were crossing the bridge of austerlitz 
 at the first halt he had understood that they were entering the cemetery at the second halt he said to himself 
 here is the grave 
 suddenly he felt hands seize the coffin then a harsh grating against the planks he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity 
 then he experienced a giddiness 
 the man and the had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance and had lowered the head before the foot 
 he recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless 
 he had just touched the bottom 
 he had a certain sensation of cold 
 a voice rose above him glacial and solemn 
 he heard latin words which he did not understand pass over him so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one 
 qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere evigilabunt alii in vitam aeternam et alii in approbrium ut videant semper 
 a voice said 
 de profundis 
 the grave voice began again 
 requiem aeternam dona ei domine 
 the voice responded 
 et lux perpetua luceat ei 
 he heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him 
 it was probably the holy water 
 he thought 
 this will be over soon now 
 patience for a little while longer 
 the priest will take his departure fauchelevent will take mestienne off to drink 
 i shall be left then fauchelevent will return alone and i shall get out that will be the work of a good hour 
 the grave voice resumed 
 requiescat in pace 
 and the voice said 
 amen 
 jean valjean strained his ears and heard something like retreating footsteps 
 there they are going now thought he 
 i am alone 
 all at once he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder 
 it was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin 
 a second shovelful fell 
 one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up 
 a third shovelful of earth fell 
 then a fourth 
 there are things which are too strong for the strongest man jean valjean lost consciousness

 the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again but a few days later the countess sent for sonya and with a cruelty neither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch nicholas and for ingratitude sonya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess cruel words without understanding what was required of her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice or for whom she could not help loving the countess and the whole rostov family but neither could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love she was silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother he first implored her to forgive him and sonya and consent to their marriage then he threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once marry her secretly 
 the countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her before replied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without his consent and he could do the same but that she would never receive that intriguer as her daughter 
 exploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising his voice told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings but if that were so he would say for the last time but he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it for natasha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door at which she had been listening 
 nicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice

 nicholas explain to you go away listen mamma darling said natasha 
 her words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which she was aiming 
 the countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her breast while nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room 
 natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded that nicholas received a promise from his mother that sonya should not be troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without his parents knowledge 
 firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment to retire from the army and return and marry sonya nicholas serious sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him passionately in love left at the beginning of january to rejoin his regiment 
 after nicholas had gone things in the rostov household were more depressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation 
 sonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his affairs which called for some decisive action their town house and estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had to go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day 
 natasha who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient every day the thought that her best days which she would have employed in loving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone tormented her incessantly his letters for the most part irritated her it hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him he was living a real life seeing new places and new people that interested him the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt her letters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice smile and glance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to which she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling 
 there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold moreover prince andrew was expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski was spending the winter and natasha felt sure he had already arrived

 fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle 
 comrade 
 before the bon coing is shut 
 the took some more earth on his shovel fauchelevent continued 
 i will pay 
 and he seized the arm 
 listen to me comrade 
 i am the convent i have come to help you 
 it is a business which can be performed at night let us begin then by going for a drink 
 and as he spoke and clung to this desperate insistence this melancholy reflection occurred to him 
 and if he drinks will he get drunk 
 provincial said the man if you positively insist upon it i consent 
 we will drink 
 after work never before 
 and he flourished his shovel briskly 
 fauchelevent held him back 
 it is argenteuil wine at six 
 oh come said the you are a ding dong ding dong all you know how to say 
 go hang yourself 
 and he threw in a second shovelful 
 fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying 
 come along and drink he cried since it is i who pays the bill 
 when we have put the child to bed said the 
 he flung in a third shovelful 
 then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added 
 cold you see and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet 
 at that moment as he loaded his shovel the bent over and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped 
 wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket and there it stopped 
 the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket 
 the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain traversed pupils 
 an idea had just occurred to him 
 he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it 
 the man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave 
 just as he turned round to get the fifth fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said 
 by the way you new man have you your card 
 the paused 
 what card 
 the sun is on the point of setting 
 good it is going to put on its nightcap 
 the gate of the cemetery will close immediately 
 well what then 
 have you your card 
 ah my card said the 
 and he fumbled in his pocket 
 having searched one pocket he proceeded to search the other he passed on to his fobs explored the first returned to the second 
 why no said he i have not my card 
 i must have forgotten it 
 fifteen francs fine said fauchelevent 
 the turned green 
 green is the pallor of livid people 
 ah 
 he exclaimed fifteen francs fine 
 
 with the moon 
 
 three pieces of a hundred sous said fauchelevent 
 the dropped his shovel 
 turn had come 
 ah come now conscript said fauchelevent none of this despair there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave fifteen francs is fifteen francs and besides you may not be able to pay it 
 i am an old hand you are a new one 
 i know all the ropes and the devices 
 i will give you some friendly advice one thing is clear the sun is on the point of setting it is touching the dome now the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more 
 that is true replied the man 
 five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave it is as hollow as the devil this grave and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut 
 that is true 
 in that case a fine of fifteen francs 
 fifteen francs 
 but you have time 
 where do you live 
 a couple of steps from the barrier a quarter of an hour from here no rue de vaugirard 
 you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed 
 that is exactly so 
 once outside the gate you gallop home you get your card you return the cemetery porter admits you 
 as you have your card there will be nothing to pay 
 and you will bury your corpse watch it for you in the meantime so that it shall not run away 
 i am indebted to you for my life peasant 
 decamp said fauchelevent 
 the overwhelmed with gratitude shook his hand and set off on a run 
 when the man had disappeared in the thicket fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance then he leaned over the grave and said in a low tone 
 father madeleine 
 there was no reply 
 fauchelevent was seized with a shudder 
 he tumbled rather than climbed into the grave flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried 
 are you there 
 silence in the coffin 
 fauchelevent hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his cold chisel and his hammer and pried up the coffin lid 
 jean face appeared in the twilight it was pale and his eyes were closed 
 hair rose upright on his head he sprang to his feet then fell back against the side of the grave ready to swoon on the coffin 
 he stared at jean valjean 
 jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless 
 fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh 
 he is dead 
 and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders he cried 
 and this is the way i save his life 
 then the poor man fell to sobbing 
 he soliloquized the while for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural powerful emotion often talks aloud 
 it is father fault 
 why did that fool die 
 what need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it 
 it is he who has killed m madeleine father madeleine 
 he is in the coffin 
 it is quite handy all is over 
 now is there any sense in these things ah my god he is dead 
 well and his little girl what am i to do with her 
 what will the say 
 the idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this when i think how he put himself under that cart 
 father madeleine father madeleine 
 pardine 
 he was suffocated i said so he believe me 
 well 
 a pretty trick to play he is dead that good man the very best man out of all the good good folks 
 and his little girl 
 ah 
 in the first place i go back there myself 
 i shall stay here 
 after having done such a thing as that 
 the use of being two old men if we are two old fools 
 but in the first place how did he manage to enter the convent 
 that was the beginning of it all one should not do such things 
 father madeleine 
 father madeleine father madeleine 
 madeleine 
 monsieur madeleine 
 monsieur le maire he does not hear me 
 now get out of this scrape if you can 
 and he tore his hair 
 a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance it was the cemetery gate closing 
 fauchelevent bent over jean valjean and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit 
 jean eyes were open and gazing at him 
 to see a corpse is alarming to behold a resurrection is almost as much so 
 fauchelevent became like stone pale haggard overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one and staring at jean valjean who was gazing at him 
 i fell asleep said jean valjean 
 and he raised himself to a sitting posture 
 fauchelevent fell on his knees 
 just good virgin 
 how you frightened me 
 then he sprang to his feet and cried 
 thanks father madeleine 
 jean valjean had merely fainted 
 the fresh air had revived him 
 joy is the ebb of terror 
 fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean had 
 so you are not dead 
 oh 
 how wise you are 
 i called you so much that you came back 
 when i saw your eyes shut i said good there he is stifled i should have gone raving mad mad enough for a strait jacket 
 they would have put me in bicetre what do you suppose i should have done if you had been dead and your little girl 
 that would never have understood it 
 the child is thrust into your arms and then the grandfather is dead 
 what a story good saints of paradise what a tale 
 ah you are alive the best of it 
 i am cold said jean valjean 
 this remark recalled fauchelevent thoroughly to reality and there was pressing need of it 
 the souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves although they did not realize it and there was about them something uncanny which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place 
 let us get out of here quickly exclaimed fauchelevent 
 he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself 
 but first take a drop said he 
 the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties 
 he got out of the coffin and helped fauchelevent to nail on the lid again 
 three minutes later they were out of the grave 
 moreover fauchelevent was perfectly composed 
 he took his time the cemetery was closed 
 the arrival of the gribier was not to be apprehended 
 that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings since it was in pocket without a card he could not get back into the cemetery 
 fauchelevent took the shovel and jean valjean the and together they buried the empty coffin 
 when the grave was full fauchelevent said to jean valjean 
 let us go 
 i will keep the shovel do you carry off the mattock 
 night was falling 
 jean valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking he had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a corpse 
 the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks 
 he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb 
 you are benumbed said fauchelevent 
 it is a pity that i have a game leg for otherwise we might step out briskly 
 bah replied jean valjean four paces will put life into my legs once more 
 they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed on arriving before the closed gate and the pavilion fauchelevent who held the card in his hand dropped it into the box the porter pulled the rope the gate opened and they went out 
 how well everything is going said fauchelevent what a capital idea that was of yours father madeleine 
 they passed the vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world in the neighborhood of the cemetery a shovel and pick are equal to two passports 
 the rue vaugirard was deserted 
 father madeleine said fauchelevent as they went along and raising his eyes to the houses your eyes are better than mine show me no 
 here it is said jean valjean 
 there is no one in the street said fauchelevent 
 give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me 
 fauchelevent entered no ascended to the very top guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret and knocked in the dark at the door of an attic 
 a voice replied 
 come in 
 it was voice 
 fauchelevent opened the door 
 the dwelling was like all such wretched habitations an unfurnished and encumbered garret a coffin the place of a commode a served for a a straw mattress served for a bed the floor served instead of tables and chairs 
 in a corner on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap 
 the whole of this interior bore traces of having been overturned one would have said that there had been an earthquake for one the covers were displaced the rags scattered about the jug broken the mother had been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous and search 
 it was plain that the had made a desperate search for his card and had made everybody in the garret from the jug to his wife responsible for its loss 
 he wore an air of desperation 
 but fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success 
 he entered and said 
 i have brought you back your shovel and pick 
 gribier gazed at him in stupefaction 
 is it you peasant 
 and morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery 
 and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor 
 what is the meaning of this demanded gribier 
 the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out of your pocket that i found it on the ground after you were gone that i have buried the corpse that i have filled the grave that i have done your work that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs 
 there you have it conscript 
 thanks villager exclaimed gribier radiant 
 the next time i will pay for the drinks

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter vii 
 
 in which will be found the origin of the saying 
 lose the card 
 this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean 
 when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure fauchelevent who had not taken his eyes from the saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt 
 then fauchelevent took a supreme resolve 
 he placed himself between the grave and the crossed his arms and said 
 i am the one to pay 
 the stared at him in amazement and replied 
 that peasant 
 fauchelevent repeated 
 i am the one who pays 
 what 
 for the wine 
 what wine 
 that argenteuil wine 
 where is the argenteuil 
 at the bon coing 
 go to the devil said the 
 and he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin 
 the coffin gave back a hollow sound 
 fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle

 book eight 
 chapter i 
 
 after prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time only the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the club again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising her went away to moscow 
 in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown 
 moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre like a guest whose place was always ready awaiting him for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to everyone 
 benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons churches and books no one and nothing met with a refusal from him and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection he would have given everything away there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there were quarrels his kindly smile and jests reconciled the antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there 
 when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men at balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il pas de sexe they said of him 
 he is charming he has no sex 
 pierre was one of those retired of whom there were hundreds ending their days in moscow 
 how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his position were he could not have believed it had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia then himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs 
 but instead of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife a retired fond of eating and drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired moscow he had so despised seven years before 
 sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained

 after prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time only the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the club again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising her went away to moscow 
 in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown 
 moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre like a guest whose place was always ready awaiting him for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to everyone 
 benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons churches and books no one and nothing met with a refusal from him and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection he would have given everything away there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there were quarrels his kindly smile and jests reconciled the antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there 
 when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men at balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il pas de sexe they said of him 
 he is charming he has no sex 
 pierre was one of those retired of whom there were hundreds ending their days in moscow 
 how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his position were he could not have believed it had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia then himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs 
 but instead of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife a retired fond of eating and drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired moscow he had so despised seven years before 
 sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained 
 in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired he had formerly despised they were empty stupid contented fellows satisfied with their position while i am still discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path in life of their own and like me were brought by force of circumstances society and race by that elemental force against which man is powerless to the condition i am in said he to himself in moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his comrades in destiny as he pitied himself 
 pierre longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment what for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them and took up a book or hurried of to the club or to apollon to exchange the gossip of the town 
 helene who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of the stupidest women in the world thought pierre is regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards through the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory over the french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the catholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about an authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand we all profess the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all that i see i have tried and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it so it appears that it must be so but i what is to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work was connected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above all read

 a successful interrogatory 
 an hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented themselves at no rue the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped 
 they were fauchelevent jean valjean and cosette 
 the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the in the rue du where fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day 
 cosette had passed these hours trembling silently and understanding nothing 
 she trembled to such a degree that she wept 
 she had neither eaten nor slept the worthy had plied her with a hundred questions without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days 
 she divined that they were passing through a crisis she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being say nothing 
 fear is mute 
 moreover no one guards a secret like a child 
 but when at the expiration of these lugubrious hours she beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry would have guessed that it issued from an abyss 
 fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the all the doors opened 
 thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in 
 the porter who had received his instructions opened the little door which connected the courtyard with the garden and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago in the wall at the bottom of the court which faced the carriage entrance 
 the porter admitted all three of them through this door and from that point they reached the inner reserved parlor where fauchelevent on the preceding day had received his orders from the prioress 
 the prioress rosary in hand was waiting for them 
 a vocal mother with her veil lowered stood beside her 
 a discreet candle lighted one might almost say made a show of lighting the parlor 
 the prioress passed jean valjean in review 
 there is nothing which examines like a downcast eye 
 then she questioned him 
 you are the brother 
 yes reverend mother replied fauchelevent 
 what is your name 
 fauchelevent replied 
 ultime fauchelevent 
 he really had had a brother named ultime who was dead 
 where do you come from 
 fauchelevent replied 
 from picquigny near amiens 
 what is your age 
 fauchelevent replied 
 fifty 
 what is your profession 
 fauchelevent replied 
 gardener 
 are you a good christian 
 fauchelevent replied 
 every one is in the family 
 is this your little girl 
 fauchelevent replied 
 yes reverend mother 
 you are her father 
 fauchelevent replied 
 her grandfather 
 the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice 
 he answers well 
 jean valjean had not uttered a single word 
 the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother 
 she will grow up ugly 
 the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said 
 father fauvent you will get another with a bell two will be required now 
 on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils 
 at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two men fauvent and another man were visible as they dug side by side 
 an enormous event 
 their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other 
 he is an assistant gardener 
 the vocal mothers added 
 he is a brother of father fauvent 
 jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belled henceforth he was official 
 his name was ultime fauchelevent 
 the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the observation upon cosette 
 she will grow up ugly 
 the prioress that pronounced prognosticator immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil 
 there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this 
 it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty 
 hence a lively taste for plain girls 
 the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old fauchelevent he won a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom he had saved and sheltered in those of gribier who said to himself 
 he spared me that fine with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god there was a coffin containing a body in the and a coffin without a body in the vaugirard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby but no one was aware of it 
 as for the convent its gratitude to fauchelevent was very great fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners

 chapter ii 
 
 at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his daughter moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor regime had weakened and a patriotic and tendency prevailed there and this together with his past and his intellect and his originality at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object of particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow opposition to the government 
 the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abrupt stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present for them all that house with its gigantic mirrors furniture powdered footmen and the stern shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentle daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host there were also hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued 
 latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since julie whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years she regretted presence and having no one to write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whom to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the time for prince return and marriage was approaching but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention of the young countess rostova the old prince who apart from that was usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six nephew to her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas some symptoms of her irritability however often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the french alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at any moment get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled became flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholas following her example would sob and without permission would leave his corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her but what distressed the princess most of all was her irritability which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess mary more than anything else this was his intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his intentions had occurred to him in jest that if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had evidently pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of bourienne 
 one day in moscow in princess presence she thought her father did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking horrible vile inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs 
 next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army 
 he obey i said it twice and he obey she is the first person in this house my best friend cried the prince and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princess mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house go let me set eyes on you beg her pardon 
 princess mary asked mademoiselle pardon and also her pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged for her intervention 
 at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn him she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against herself

 latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since julie whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years she regretted presence and having no one to write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whom to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the time for prince return and marriage was approaching but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention of the young countess rostova the old prince who apart from that was usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six nephew to her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas some symptoms of her irritability however often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the french alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at any moment get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled became flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholas following her example would sob and without permission would leave his corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her but what distressed the princess most of all was her irritability which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess mary more than anything else this was his intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his intentions had occurred to him in jest that if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had evidently pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of bourienne 
 one day in moscow in princess presence she thought her father did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking horrible vile inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs 
 next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army 
 he obey i said it twice and he obey she is the first person in this house my best friend cried the prince and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princess mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house go let me set eyes on you beg her pardon 
 princess mary asked mademoiselle pardon and also her pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged for her intervention 
 at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn him she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against herself

 chapter ix 
 
 cloistered 
 cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent 
 it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean daughter 
 moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and then she would not have said anything in any case 
 as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to breathe 
 a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her 
 she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean 
 she speedily became accustomed to the convent 
 only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so 
 once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her away with me 
 cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to don the garb of the pupils of the house 
 jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside this was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the thenardiers inn 
 it was not very threadbare even now jean valjean locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a little valise which he found means of procuring he set this valise on a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person 
 father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which smells so good 
 father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action in addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less work since it was shared 
 lastly as he was very fond of snuff he found the presence of m madeleine an advantage in that he used three times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner seeing that m madeleine paid for it 
 the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the other fauvent 
 if these holy women had possessed anything of glance they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden it was always the elder fauchelevent the old the infirm the lame man who went and never the other but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on god know not how to spy or whether they were by preference occupied in keeping watch on each other they paid no heed to this 
 moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out 
 javert watched the quarter for more than a month 
 this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs 
 henceforth those four walls constituted his world he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy 
 a very sweet life began for him 
 he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden in company with fauchelevent 
 this hovel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in was composed as the reader already knows of three chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls 
 the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain to m madeleine by father fauchelevent 
 the walls of this chamber had for ornament in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the and the basket a royalist of applied to the wall over the and of which the following is an exact facsimile 
 
 graphic here 
 
 this specimen of vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener an old chouan who had died in the convent and whose place fauchelevent had taken 
 jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful he had formerly been a pruner of trees and he gladly found himself a gardener once more 
 it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture 
 he turned these to advantage almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted and wild he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit 
 cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and adored him 
 at the appointed hour she flew to the hut when she entered the lowly cabin she filled it with paradise jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette 
 the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing meagre like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest 
 for cosette laughed now 
 face had even undergone a change to a certain extent the gloom had disappeared from it 
 a smile is the same as sunshine it banishes winter from the human countenance 
 recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her and at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory 
 god has his own ways moreover the convent contributed like cosette to uphold and complete the work in jean valjean 
 it is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side 
 a bridge built by the devil exists there 
 jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the convent of the so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general and pride was beginning to spring up who knows 
 he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred 
 the convent stopped him on that downward path 
 this was the second place of captivity which he had seen in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had beheld another a frightful place a terrible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law now after the galleys he saw the cloister and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety 
 sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe and slowly descended the endless spirals of revery 
 he recalled his former companions 
 how wretched they were they rose at dawn and toiled until night hardly were they permitted to sleep they lay on camp beds where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year they were clothed in frightful red blouses they were allowed as a great favor linen trousers in the hottest weather and a woollen blouse on their backs when it was very cold they drank no wine and ate no meat except when they went on fatigue duty 
 they lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered voices with shorn heads beneath the cudgel and in disgrace 
 then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes 
 these beings also lived with shorn heads with downcast eyes with lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scoffs of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline 
 their names also had vanished from among men they no longer existed except under austere appellations they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until evening without food they were attired not in a red blouse but in a black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having even according to the season the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever 
 they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw 
 and finally they were not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse themselves to rise and to go and pray in an and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones 
 on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face upon the pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross 
 the others were men these were women 
 what had those men done 
 they had stolen violated pillaged murdered assassinated 
 they were bandits counterfeiters poisoners incendiaries murderers parricides 
 what had these women done 
 they had done nothing whatever 
 on the one hand highway robbery fraud deceit violence sensuality homicide all sorts of sacrilege every variety of crime on the other one thing only innocence 
 perfect innocence almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption attached to the earth by virtue already possessing something of heaven through holiness 
 on the one hand confidences over crimes which are exchanged in whispers on the other the confession of faults made aloud and what crimes 
 and what faults 
 on the one hand miasms on the other an ineffable perfume on the one hand a moral pest guarded from sight penned up under the range of cannon and literally devouring its victims on the other the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth there darkness here the shadow but a shadow filled with gleams of light and of gleams full of radiance 
 two strongholds of slavery but in the first deliverance possible a legal limit always in sight and then escape 
 in the second perpetuity the sole hope at the distant extremity of the future that faint light of liberty which men call death 
 in the first men are bound only with chains in the other chained by faith 
 what flowed from the first 
 an immense curse the gnashing of teeth hatred desperate viciousness a cry of rage against human society a sarcasm against heaven 
 what results flowed from the second 
 blessings and love 
 and in these two places so similar yet so unlike these two species of beings who were so very unlike were undergoing the same work expiation 
 jean valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former that personal expiation the expiation for self 
 but he did not understand that of these last that of creatures without reproach and without stain and he trembled as he asked himself the expiation of what 
 what expiation 
 a voice within his conscience replied 
 the most divine of human generosities the expiation for others 
 here all personal theory is withheld we are only the narrator we place ourselves at jean point of view and we translate his impressions 
 before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation the highest possible pitch of virtue the innocence which pardons men their faults and which expiates in their stead servitude submitted to torture accepted punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned for the sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of god but even there preserving its distinct and mediatorial character sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed 
 and he remembered that he had dared to murmur 
 often in the middle of the night he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy and that he wretch that he was had shaken his fist at god 
 there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply like a warning whisper from providence itself 
 the scaling of that wall the passing of those barriers the adventure accepted even at the risk of death the painful and difficult ascent all those efforts even which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation he had made in order to gain entrance into this one 
 was this a symbol of his destiny 
 this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar 
 again he beheld gratings bolts iron guard whom 
 angels 
 these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers he now beheld once more around lambs 
 this was a place of expiation and not of punishment and yet it was still more austere more gloomy and more pitiless than the other 
 these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts a cold harsh wind that wind which had chilled his youth traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures a still harsher and more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves 
 why 
 when he thought on these things all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity 
 in these meditations his pride vanished 
 he scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways he felt his pettiness and many a time he wept 
 all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the holy injunctions cosette through love the convent through humility 
 sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister 
 it seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before god 
 everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant flowers those children who uttered joyous cries those grave and simple women that silent cloister slowly permeated him and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children 
 and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life 
 the first when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him the second at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him and when the galleys were again yawning and that had it not been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and had it not been for the second into torment 
 his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more 
 many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up

 prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on mademoiselle advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about twice a week 
 on december st nicholas day and the name day all moscow came to the front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to princess mary 
 metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion until the arrival the morning had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the study 
 to force the guard 
 at first she heard only voice then her then both voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown and fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards 
 you understand shouted the prince but i do french spy slave of buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell you 
 metivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room 
 the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keep calm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away 
 through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry spies traitors traitors everywhere not a peace in my own house 
 after departure the old prince called his daughter in and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spy had been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a list and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was that scoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said he could not have a peace and could not die quietly 
 no we must part we must part understand that understand it i cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying to appear calm added and imagine i have said this in a moment of anger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be carried out we must part so find some place for yourself but he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and screamed 
 if only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent for mademoiselle bourienne and subsided into his study 
 at two the six chosen guests assembled for dinner 
 these guests the famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with his nephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the and of the younger generation pierre and boris drubetskoy awaited the prince in the drawing room 
 boris who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house 
 the house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society but his little circle though not much talked about in town was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and rostopchin had replied that he could not come 
 on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince nicholas bolkonski 
 oh yes yes replied the commander in chief how is he 
 the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice all were silent or talked in low tones prince nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address her feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchin alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town news and now the latest political gossip 
 lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself 
 at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news seizure of the duke of territory and the russian note hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts 
 bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said count rostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before one only wonders at the or blindness of the crowned heads now the turn has come and bonaparte scruple to depose the head of the catholic church yet all keep silent our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the duke of territory and even count rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible 
 other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of oldenburg said prince bolkonski he shifts the dukes about as i might move my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estates 
 the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation remarked boris joining in respectfully 
 he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the duke prince bolkonski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind evidently considering him too young 
 i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him 
 pierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note 
 does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long as its substance is forcible 
 my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style returned count rostopchin 
 pierre now understood the dissatisfaction with the wording of the note 
 one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked the old prince there in petersburg they are always writing not notes only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed unnaturally 
 there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared his throat to draw attention 
 did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure cut by the new french ambassador 
 eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his presence 
 his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him 
 all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was impossible to pass any judgment 
 impudent fellows said the prince you know metivier i turned him out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him spite of my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily at his daughter 
 and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder 
 after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate the old prince princess mary too went round to him 
 he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten the talk that his decision remained in force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now 
 when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old men sat together 
 prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war 
 he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european affairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we ought not to fight either for or against austria our political interests are all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross the russian frontier as was the case in 
 how can we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at our youths look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom of heaven 
 he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone 
 french dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turned metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and a scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to a party last night and there out of five ladies three were roman catholics and had the indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays and they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our public baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young people prince one would like to take peter the old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them 
 all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile and wagged his head approvingly 
 well your excellency keep well said rostopchin getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince 
 my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed 
 following example the others also rose

 in there was living in moscow a french doctor metivier who had rapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable as frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily clever doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but as an equal 
 prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on mademoiselle advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about twice a week 
 on december st nicholas day and the name day all moscow came to the front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to princess mary 
 metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion until the arrival the morning had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the study

 princess mary as she sat listening to the old talk and faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her hostile attitude toward her she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by boris drubetskoy who was visiting them for the third time already 
 princess mary turned with questioning look to pierre who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room 
 may i stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her 
 oh yes she answered you noticed nothing her look asked 
 pierre was in an agreeable mood he looked straight before him and smiled quietly 
 have you known that young man long princess he asked 
 who 
 drubetskoy 
 no not long 
 do you like him 
 yes he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said princess mary still thinking of that conversation with her father 
 because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress 
 you have observed that said princess mary 
 yes returned pierre with a smile and this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i can read him like a book at present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to you or mademoiselle julie karagina he is very attentive to her 
 he visits them 
 yes very often and do you know the new way of courting said pierre with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary 
 no replied princess mary 
 to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very melancholy with mademoiselle karagina said pierre 
 really asked princess mary looking into kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone i should like to tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it would be a relief he would give me advice 
 would you marry him 
 oh my god count there are moments when i would marry anybody she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice ah how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that she went on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but grieve him and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only one thing left to go away but where could i go 
 what is wrong what is it princess 
 but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into tears 
 i know what is the matter with me today take any notice forget what i have said 
 gaiety vanished completely he anxiously questioned the princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of that prince marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son 
 have you any news of the rostovs she asked to change the subject i was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew any day i should like them to meet here 
 and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring to the old prince 
 princess mary shook her head 
 what is to be done in a few months the year will be up the thing is impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments i wish they would come sooner i hope to be friends with her you have known them a long time said princess mary tell me honestly the whole truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of her the real truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing this against his will that i should like to know 
 an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations and repeated requests to be told the whole truth expressed on the princess part toward her future and a wish that he should disapprove of choice but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought 
 i know how to answer your question he said blushing without knowing why i really know what sort of girl she is i analyze her at all she is enchanting but what makes her so i know that is all one can say about her 
 princess mary sighed and the expression on her face said yes what i expected and feared 
 is she clever she asked 
 pierre considered 
 i think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be clever oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all 
 princess mary again shook her head disapprovingly 
 ah i so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do 
 i hear they are expected very soon said pierre 
 princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her

 of nobility 
 we will speak of nobility first as a portion of an estate then as a condition of 
 particular persons a monarchy where there is no nobility at all is ever a pure 
 and absolute tyranny as that of the turks for nobility attempers sovereignty and draws the eyes of me people somewhat aside from the line royal but for democracies they need it not and they are commonly more quiet and less subject to sedition then where there are stirps of nobles for eyes are upon the business and not upon the persons or if upon the persons it is for the business sake as fittest and not for flags and pedigree 
 we see the switzers last well notwithstanding their diversity of religion and of cantons for utility is their bond and not respects the united provinces of the low countries in their government excel for where there is an equality the consultations are more indifferent and the payments and tributes more cheerful a great and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch but diminisheth power and putteth life and spirit into the people but presseth their fortune it is well when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice and yet maintained in that height as the insolence of inferiors may be broken upon them before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings 
 a numerous nobility causeth poverty and inconvenience in a state for it is a surcharge of expense and besides it being of necessity that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune it maketh a kind of disproportion between honour and means 
 as for nobility in particular persons it is a reverend thing to see an ancient castle or building not in decay or to see a fair timber tree sound and perfect how much more to behold an ancient noble family which hath stood against me waves and weathers of time 
 for new nobility is but the act of power but ancient nobility is the act of time those that are first raised to nobility are commonly more virtuous but less 
 innocent than their descendants for there is rarely any rising but by a of good and evil arts but it is reason the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity and their faults die with themselves 
 nobility of birth commonly abateth industry and he that is not industrious envieth him that is besides noble persons cannot go much higher and he that standeth at a stay when others rise can hardly avoid motions of envy on the other side nobility extinguished the passive envy from others towards them 
 because they are in possession of honour certainly kings that have able men of their nobility shall find ease in employing them and a better slide into their business for people naturally bend to them as born in some sort to command

 and absolute tyranny as that of the turks for nobility attempers sovereignty and draws the eyes of me people somewhat aside from the line royal but for democracies they need it not and they are commonly more quiet and less subject to sedition then where there are stirps of nobles for eyes are upon the business and not upon the persons or if upon the persons it is for the business sake as fittest and not for flags and pedigree 
 we see the switzers last well notwithstanding their diversity of religion and of cantons for utility is their bond and not respects the united provinces of the low countries in their government excel for where there is an equality the consultations are more indifferent and the payments and tributes more cheerful a great and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch but diminisheth power and putteth life and spirit into the people but presseth their fortune it is well when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice and yet maintained in that height as the insolence of inferiors may be broken upon them before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings 
 a numerous nobility causeth poverty and inconvenience in a state for it is a surcharge of expense and besides it being of necessity that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune it maketh a kind of disproportion between honour and means 
 as for nobility in particular persons it is a reverend thing to see an ancient castle or building not in decay or to see a fair timber tree sound and perfect how much more to behold an ancient noble family which hath stood against me waves and weathers of time 
 for new nobility is but the act of power but ancient nobility is the act of time those that are first raised to nobility are commonly more virtuous but less 
 innocent than their descendants for there is rarely any rising but by a of good and evil arts but it is reason the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity and their faults die with themselves 
 nobility of birth commonly abateth industry and he that is not industrious envieth him that is besides noble persons cannot go much higher and he that standeth at a stay when others rise can hardly avoid motions of envy on the other side nobility extinguished the passive envy from others towards them 
 because they are in possession of honour certainly kings that have able men of their nobility shall find ease in employing them and a better slide into their business for people naturally bend to them as born in some sort to command

 book just man 
 chapter xiii 
 
 what he believed 
 we are not obliged to sound the bishop of d on the score of orthodoxy 
 in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect 
 the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word 
 moreover certain natures being given we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own 
 what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery 
 these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where souls enter naked 
 the point on which we are certain is that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case 
 no decay is possible to the diamond he believed to the extent of his powers 
 credo in patrem he often exclaimed 
 moreover he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god 
 the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love 
 in was in that quarter quia multum he loved he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry what was this excess of love 
 it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things 
 he lived without disdain he was indulgent towards creation 
 every man even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals the bishop of d had none of that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless 
 he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes 
 who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth 
 hideousness of aspect deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his indignation 
 he was touched almost softened by them it seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation or the excuse for them 
 he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties 
 he examined without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature 
 this revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings 
 one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by him 
 suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider 
 his sister heard him say 
 poor beast 
 it is not its fault 
 why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness puerile they may be but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to saint francis and of marcus aurelius 
 one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant thus lived this just man 
 sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing more venerable possible 
 monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories anent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate and possibly a violent man 
 his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly thought by thought for in a character as in a rock there may exist apertures made by drops of water these hollows are uneffaceable these formations are indestructible 
 in as we think we have already said he reached his birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty 
 he was not tall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond of taking long strolls on foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion 
 gregory xvi at the age of eighty held himself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop 
 monseigneur welcome had what the people term a fine head but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine 
 when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person 
 his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man a good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man 
 that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon 
 on the first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine man 
 but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile 
 respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle 
 as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled every day of his life 
 filled is exactly the word certainly the day was quite full to the brim of good words and good deeds 
 nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired it seemed to be a sort of rite with him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens 
 sometimes if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night 
 he was there alone communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take its flight from him and something descend into him 
 mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe 
 he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity past a mystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced their way into all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible he gazed upon it

 chapter xiv 
 
 after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came to congratulate the countess wished to have a talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna mikhaylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg anna mikhaylovna with her but pleasant face drew her chair nearer to that of the countess 
 with you i will be quite frank said anna mikhaylovna there are not many left of us old friends why i so value your friendship 
 anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused the countess pressed her hand 
 vera she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite how is it you have so little tact you see you are not wanted here go to the other girls or 
 the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt 
 if you had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied as she rose to go to her own room 
 but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sonya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the first he had ever written boris and natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when vera entered sonya and natasha looked at vera with guilty happy faces 
 it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera 
 how often have i asked you not to take my things she said you have a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas 
 in a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen 
 you always manage to do things at the wrong time continued vera you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you 
 though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand 
 and at your age what secrets can there be between natasha and boris or between you two all nonsense 
 now vera what does it matter to you said natasha in defense speaking very gently 
 she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone 
 very silly said vera i am ashamed of you secrets indeed 
 all have secrets of their own answered natasha getting warmer we interfere with you and berg 
 i should think not said vera because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior but just tell mamma how you are behaving with boris 
 natalya ilynichna behaves very well to me remarked boris i have nothing to complain of 
 boris you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly she used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the special sense they attached to it why does she bother me and she added turning to vera never understand it because never loved anyone you have no heart you are a madame de genlis and nothing more this nickname bestowed on vera by nicholas was considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg as much as you please she finished quickly 
 i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors 
 well now done what you wanted put in nicholas said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them go to the nursery 
 all four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room 
 the unpleasant things were said to me remarked vera i said none to anyone 
 madame de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices through the door 
 the handsome vera who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer 
 in the drawing room the conversation was still going on 
 ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either i know that at the rate we are living our means last long all the club and his easygoing nature even in the country do we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides but talk about me tell me how you managed everything i often wonder at you annette how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow to petersburg to those ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all quite astonishing how did you get things settled i possibly do it 
 ah my love answered anna mikhaylovna god grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction one learns many things then she added with a certain pride that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of those big people i write a note princess desires an interview with so and then i take a cab and go myself two three or four times till i get what i want i mind what they think of me 
 well and to whom did you apply about bory asked the countess you see yours is already an officer in the guards while my nicholas is going as a cadet no one to interest himself for him to whom did you apply 
 to prince vasili he was so kind he at once agreed to everything and put the matter before the emperor said princess anna mikhaylovna enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end 
 has prince vasili aged much asked the countess i have not seen him since we acted together at the rumyantsovs theatricals i expect he has forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said the countess with a smile 
 he is just the same as ever replied anna mikhaylovna overflowing with amiability his position has not turned his head at all he said to me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear princess i am at your command yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation but nataly you know my love for my son i would do anything for his happiness and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one continued anna mikhaylovna sadly dropping her voice my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress would you believe it i have literally not a penny and know how to equip boris she took out her handkerchief and began to cry i need five hundred rubles and have only one note i am in such a state my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov if he will not assist his godson you know he is godfather and allow him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been thrown away i shall not be able to equip him 
 the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence 
 i often think though perhaps a sin said the princess that here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich all alone that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth a burden to him and life is only just beginning 
 surely he will leave something to boris said the countess 
 heaven only knows my dear these rich grandees are so selfish still i will take boris and go to see him at once and i shall speak to him straight out let people think what they will of me really all the same to me when my fate is at stake the princess rose now two and you dine at four there will just be time 
 and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the anteroom with him 
 my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear wish me good luck 
 are you going to count cyril vladimirovich my dear said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added if he is better ask pierre to dine with us he has been to the house you know and danced with the children be sure to invite him my dear we will see how taras distinguishes himself today he says count orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will be

 chapter 
 
 as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs situation and her ardent desire to see him with a wish that he would transmit to her as early as possible some token of forgiveness by me 
 forgiveness said linton i have nothing to forgive her ellen you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon if you like and say that i am not angry but sorry to have lost her especially as i can never think be happy it is out of the question my going to see her however we are eternally divided and should she really wish to oblige me let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country 
 and you write her a little note sir i asked imploringly 
 no he answered it is needless my communication with family shall be as sparing as his with mine it shall not exist 
 mr coldness depressed me exceedingly and all the way from the grange i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said when i repeated it and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella i dare say she had been on the watch for me since morning i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway and i nodded to her but she drew back as if afraid of being observed i entered without knocking there never was such a dreary dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented i must confess that if i had been in the young place i would at least have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a duster but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her her pretty face was wan and listless her hair uncurled some locks hanging lankly down and some carelessly twisted round her head probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening hindley was not there mr heathcliff sat at a table turning over some papers in his but he rose when i appeared asked me how i did quite friendly and offered me a chair he was the only thing there that seemed decent and i thought he never looked better so much had circumstances altered their positions that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman and his wife as a thorough little slattern she came forward eagerly to greet me and held out one hand to take the expected letter i shook my head she understand the hint but followed me to a sideboard where i went to lay my bonnet and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres and said 
 if you have got anything for isabella as no doubt you have nelly give it to her you make a secret of it we have no secrets between us 
 oh i have nothing i replied thinking it best to speak the truth at once my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present he sends his love and his wishes for your happiness and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication as nothing good could come of keeping it up 
 mrs lip quivered slightly and she returned to her seat in the window her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me and began to put questions concerning catherine i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness and he extorted from me by most of the facts connected with its origin i blamed her as she deserved for bringing it all on herself and ended by hoping that he would follow mr example and avoid future interference with his family for good or evil 
 mrs linton is now just recovering i said never be like she was but her life is spared and if you really have a regard for her shun crossing her way again nay move out of this country entirely and that you may not regret it inform you catherine linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw as that young lady is different from me her appearance is changed greatly her character much more so and the person who is compelled of necessity to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was by common humanity and a sense of duty 
 that is quite possible remarked heathcliff forcing himself to seem calm quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine to his duty and humanity and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine to his before you leave this house i must exact a promise from you that get me an interview with her consent or refuse i will see her what do you say 
 i say mr heathcliff i replied you must not you never shall through my means another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether 
 with your aid that may be avoided he continued and should there be danger of such an he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her i think i shall be justified in going to extremes i wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether catherine would suffer greatly from his loss the fear that she would restrains me and there you see the distinctions between our feelings had he been in my place and i in his though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall i never would have raised a hand against him you may look incredulous if you please i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his the moment her regard ceased i would have torn his heart out and drunk his blood but till you believe me you know then i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head 
 and yet i interrupted you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now when she has nearly forgotten you and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress 
 you suppose she has nearly forgotten me he said oh nelly you know she has not you know as well as i do that for every thought she spends on linton she spends a thousand on me at a most miserable period of my life i had a notion of the kind it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again and then linton would be nothing nor hindley nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt two words would comprehend my and hell existence after losing her would be hell yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued edgar attachment more than mine if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he love as much in eighty years as i could in a day and catherine has a heart as deep as i have the sea could be as readily contained in that as her whole affection be monopolized by him tush he is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog or her horse it is not in him to be loved like me how can she love in him what he has not 
 catherine and edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be cried isabella with sudden vivacity no one has a right to talk in that manner and i hear my brother depreciated in silence 
 your brother is wondrous fond of you too he observed heathcliff scornfully he turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity 
 he is not aware of what i suffer she replied i tell him that 
 you have been telling him something then you have written have you 
 to say that i was married i did saw the note and nothing since 
 no 
 my young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition i remarked love comes short in her case obviously whose i may guess but perhaps i say 
 i should guess it was her own said heathcliff she degenerates into a mere slut she is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early hardly credit it but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home however suit this house so much the better for not being over nice and take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad 
 well sir returned i i hope consider that mrs heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on and that she has been brought up like an only daughter whom everyone was ready to serve you must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her and you must treat her kindly whatever be your notion of mr edgar you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments or she have abandoned the elegances and comforts and friends of her former home to fix contentedly in such a wilderness as this with you 
 she abandoned them under a delusion he answered picturing in me a hero of romance and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion i can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished but at last i think she begins to know me i perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first and the senseless incapability of discerning that i was in earnest when i gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself it was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that i did not love her i believed at one time no lessons could teach her that and yet it is poorly learnt for this morning she announced as a piece of appalling intelligence that i had actually succeeded in making her hate me a positive labour of hercules i assure you if it be achieved i have cause to return thanks can i trust your assertion isabella are you sure you hate me if i let you alone for half a day you come sighing and wheedling to me again i dare say she would rather i had seemed all tenderness before you it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed but i care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side and i never told her a lie about it she cannot accuse me of showing a bit of deceitful softness the first thing she saw me do on coming out of the grange was to hang up her little dog and when she pleaded for it the first words i uttered were a wish that i had the hanging of every being belonging to her except one possibly she took that exception for herself but no brutality disgusted her i suppose she has an innate admiration of it if only her precious person were secure from injury now was it not the depth of genuine idiocy for that pitiful slavish brach to dream that i could love her tell your master nelly that i never in all my life met with such an abject thing as she is she even disgraces the name of linton and sometimes relented from pure lack of invention in my experiments on what she could endure and still creep shamefully cringing back but tell him also to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease that i keep strictly within the limits of the law i have avoided up to this period giving her the slightest right to claim a separation and more thank nobody for dividing us if she desired to go she might the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her 
 mr heathcliff said i this is the talk of a madman and your wife most likely is convinced you are mad and for that reason she has borne with you hitherto but now that you say she may go doubtless avail herself of the permission you are not so bewitched are you as to remain with him of your own accord 
 take care ellen answered isabella her eyes sparkling irefully there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her endeavours to make himself detested put faith in a single word he speaks a lying fiend a monster and not a human being been told i might leave him before and made the attempt but i dare not repeat it only ellen promise not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or catherine whatever he may pretend he wishes to provoke edgar to desperation he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him and he obtain die first i just hope i pray that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me the single pleasure i can imagine is to die or see him dead 
 will do for the present said heathcliff if you are called upon in a court of law remember her language nelly and take a good look at that countenance near the point which would suit me no not fit to be your own guardian isabella now and i being your legal protector must detain you in my custody however distasteful the obligation may be go upstairs i have something to say to ellen dean in private not the way upstairs i tell you why this is the road upstairs child 
 he seized and thrust her from the room and returned muttering 
 i have no pity i have no pity the more the worms writhe the more i yearn to crush out their entrails it is a moral teething and i grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain 
 do you understand what the word pity means i said hastening to resume my bonnet did you ever feel a touch of it in your life 
 put that down he interrupted perceiving my intention to depart you are not going yet come here now nelly i must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine and that without delay i swear that i meditate no harm i desire to cause any disturbance or to exasperate or insult mr linton i only wish to hear from herself how she is and why she has been ill and to ask if anything that i could do would be of use to her last night i was in the grange garden six hours and return there tonight and every night haunt the place and every day till i find an opportunity of entering if edgar linton meets me i shall not hesitate to knock him down and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay if his servants oppose me i shall threaten them off with these pistols but it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them or their master and you could do it so easily warn you when i came and then you might let me in unobserved as soon as she was alone and watch till i departed your conscience quite calm you would be hindering mischief 
 i protested against playing that treacherous part in my house and besides i urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying mrs tranquillity for his satisfaction the commonest occurrence startles her painfully i said all nerves and she bear the surprise positive persist sir or else i shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs and take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions 
 in that case take measures to secure you woman exclaimed heathcliff you shall not leave wuthering heights till tomorrow morning it is a foolish story to assert that catherine could not bear to see me and as to surprising her i desire it you must prepare her ask her if i may come you say she never mentions my name and that i am never mentioned to her to whom should she mention me if i am a forbidden topic in the house she thinks you are all spies for her husband oh no doubt in hell among you i guess by her silence as much as anything what she feels you say she is often restless and is that a proof of tranquillity you talk of her mind being unsettled how the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation and that insipid paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity from pity and charity he might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares let us settle it at once will you stay here and am i to fight my way to catherine over linton and his footmen or will you be my friend as you have been hitherto and do what i request decide cause there is no reason for my lingering another minute if you persist in your stubborn 
 well mr lockwood i argued and complained and flatly refused him fifty times but in the long run he forced me to an agreement i engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress and should she consent i promised to let him have intelligence of next absence from home when he might come and get in as he was able i be there and my should be equally out of the way was it right or wrong i fear it was wrong though expedient i thought i prevented another explosion by my compliance and i thought too it might create a favourable crisis in mental illness and then i remembered mr stern rebuke of my carrying tales and i tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject by affirming with frequent iteration that that betrayal of trust if it merited so harsh an appellation should be the last notwithstanding my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither and many misgivings i had ere i could prevail on myself to put the missive into mrs hand 
 but here is kenneth go down and tell him how much better you are my history is dree as we say and will serve to while away another morning 
 dree and dreary i reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse me but never mind extract wholesome medicines from mrs bitter herbs and firstly let me beware the fascination that lurks in catherine brilliant eyes i should be in a curious taking if i surrendered my heart to that young person and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother

 chapter 
 
 as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs situation and her ardent desire to see him with a wish that he would transmit to her as early as possible some token of forgiveness by me 
 forgiveness said linton i have nothing to forgive her ellen you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon if you like and say that i am not angry but sorry to have lost her especially as i can never think be happy it is out of the question my going to see her however we are eternally divided and should she really wish to oblige me let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country 
 and you write her a little note sir i asked imploringly 
 no he answered it is needless my communication with family shall be as sparing as his with mine it shall not exist 
 mr coldness depressed me exceedingly and all the way from the grange i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said when i repeated it and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella i dare say she had been on the watch for me since morning i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway and i nodded to her but she drew back as if afraid of being observed i entered without knocking there never was such a dreary dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented i must confess that if i had been in the young place i would at least have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a duster but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her her pretty face was wan and listless her hair uncurled some locks hanging lankly down and some carelessly twisted round her head probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening hindley was not there mr heathcliff sat at a table turning over some papers in his but he rose when i appeared asked me how i did quite friendly and offered me a chair he was the only thing there that seemed decent and i thought he never looked better so much had circumstances altered their positions that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman and his wife as a thorough little slattern she came forward eagerly to greet me and held out one hand to take the expected letter i shook my head she understand the hint but followed me to a sideboard where i went to lay my bonnet and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres and said 
 if you have got anything for isabella as no doubt you have nelly give it to her you make a secret of it we have no secrets between us 
 oh i have nothing i replied thinking it best to speak the truth at once my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present he sends his love and his wishes for your happiness and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication as nothing good could come of keeping it up 
 mrs lip quivered slightly and she returned to her seat in the window her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me and began to put questions concerning catherine i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness and he extorted from me by most of the facts connected with its origin i blamed her as she deserved for bringing it all on herself and ended by hoping that he would follow mr example and avoid future interference with his family for good or evil 
 mrs linton is now just recovering i said never be like she was but her life is spared and if you really have a regard for her shun crossing her way again nay move out of this country entirely and that you may not regret it inform you catherine linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw as that young lady is different from me her appearance is changed greatly her character much more so and the person who is compelled of necessity to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was by common humanity and a sense of duty 
 that is quite possible remarked heathcliff forcing himself to seem calm quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine to his duty and humanity and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine to his before you leave this house i must exact a promise from you that get me an interview with her consent or refuse i will see her what do you say

 chapter fourteen 
 
 jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming 
 there done my best if this suit i shall have to wait till i can do better 
 lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how ernest her work had been desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall it it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly downstairs leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink 
 she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious 
 if anyone had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came this maneuver she repeated several times to the great amusement of a young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out 
 there was a sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver like her to come alone but if she has a bad time need someone to help her home 
 in ten minutes jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time 
 not very 
 you got through quickly 
 yes thank goodness 
 why did you go alone 
 want anyone to know 
 the oddest fellow i ever saw how many did you have out 
 jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something 
 there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week 
 what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified 
 so are you what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon 
 begging your pardon it a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing 
 glad of that 
 why 
 you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and make a fine thing of the fencing scene 
 laurie burst out with a hearty laugh which made several smile in spite of themselves 
 teach you whether we play hamlet or not grand fun and will straighten you up capitally but i believe that was your only reason for saying glad in that decided way was it now 
 no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places do you 
 not often 
 i wish you 
 no harm jo i have billiards at home but no fun unless you have good players so as fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows 
 oh dear so sorry for get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys i did hope stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head 
 a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled 
 that depends upon how and where he takes it i like ned and his set and wish keep out of it mother let us have him at our house though he wants to come and if you grow like him she be willing to have us frolic together as we do now 
 she asked laurie anxiously 
 no she bear fashionable young men and shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them 
 well she get out her bandboxes yet not a fashionable party and mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then you 
 yes nobody minds them so lark away but get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times 
 be a double distilled saint 
 i bear saints just be a simple honest respectable boy and never desert you i know what i should do if you acted like mr son he had plenty of money but know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his name i believe and was altogether horrid 
 you think likely to do the same much obliged 
 no i dear i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor i worry then 
 do you worry about me jo 
 a little when you look moody and discontented as you sometimes do for got such a strong will if you once get started wrong afraid it would be hard to stop you 
 laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips smiled as if at her warnings 
 are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently 
 of course not why 
 because if you are take a bus if not like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting 
 i preach any more and like to hear the news immensely 
 very well then come on a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours 
 i got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had 
 you know you hide anything so up and fess or i tell cried laurie 
 is your secret a nice one 
 oh it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and been aching to tell it this long time come you begin 
 not say anything about it at home will you 
 not a word 
 and you tease me in private 
 i never tease 
 yes you do you get everything you want out of people i know how you do it but you are a born wheedler 
 thank you fire away 
 well left two stories with a newspaperman and to give his answer next week whispered jo in her ear 
 hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now hush it come to anything i dare say but i rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i want anyone else to be disappointed 
 it fail why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day it be fun to see them in print and we feel proud of our authoress 
 eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs 
 your secret play fair teddy or never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement 
 i may get into a scrape for telling but i promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till told you any plummy bit of news i get i know where glove is 
 is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence 
 quite enough for the present as agree when i tell you where it is 
 tell then 
 laurie bent and whispered three words in ear which produced a comical change she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know 
 saw it

 chapter fourteen 
 
 jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming 
 there done my best if this suit i shall have to wait till i can do better 
 lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how ernest her work had been desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall it it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly downstairs leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink 
 she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious 
 if anyone had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came this maneuver she repeated several times to the great amusement of a young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out 
 there was a sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver like her to come alone but if she has a bad time need someone to help her home 
 in ten minutes jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time 
 not very 
 you got through quickly 
 yes thank goodness 
 why did you go alone 
 want anyone to know 
 the oddest fellow i ever saw how many did you have out 
 jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something 
 there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week 
 what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified 
 so are you what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon 
 begging your pardon it a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing 
 glad of that 
 why 
 you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and make a fine thing of the fencing scene 
 laurie burst out with a hearty laugh which made several smile in spite of themselves 
 teach you whether we play hamlet or not grand fun and will straighten you up capitally but i believe that was your only reason for saying glad in that decided way was it now 
 no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places do you 
 not often 
 i wish you 
 no harm jo i have billiards at home but no fun unless you have good players so as fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows 
 oh dear so sorry for get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys i did hope stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head 
 a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled 
 that depends upon how and where he takes it i like ned and his set and wish keep out of it mother let us have him at our house though he wants to come and if you grow like him she be willing to have us frolic together as we do now 
 she asked laurie anxiously 
 no she bear fashionable young men and shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them 
 well she get out her bandboxes yet not a fashionable party and mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then you 
 yes nobody minds them so lark away but get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times 
 be a double distilled saint 
 i bear saints just be a simple honest respectable boy and never desert you i know what i should do if you acted like mr son he had plenty of money but know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his name i believe and was altogether horrid 
 you think likely to do the same much obliged 
 no i dear i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor i worry then 
 do you worry about me jo 
 a little when you look moody and discontented as you sometimes do for got such a strong will if you once get started wrong afraid it would be hard to stop you 
 laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips smiled as if at her warnings 
 are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently 
 of course not why 
 because if you are take a bus if not like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting 
 i preach any more and like to hear the news immensely 
 very well then come on a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours 
 i got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had 
 you know you hide anything so up and fess or i tell cried laurie 
 is your secret a nice one 
 oh it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and been aching to tell it this long time come you begin 
 not say anything about it at home will you 
 not a word 
 and you tease me in private 
 i never tease 
 yes you do you get everything you want out of people i know how you do it but you are a born wheedler 
 thank you fire away 
 well left two stories with a newspaperman and to give his answer next week whispered jo in her ear 
 hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now hush it come to anything i dare say but i rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i want anyone else to be disappointed 
 it fail why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day it be fun to see them in print and we feel proud of our authoress 
 eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs 
 your secret play fair teddy or never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement 
 i may get into a scrape for telling but i promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till told you any plummy bit of news i get i know where glove is 
 is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence 
 quite enough for the present as agree when i tell you where it is 
 tell then 
 laurie bent and whispered three words in ear which produced a comical change she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know 
 saw it 
 where 
 pocket 
 all this time 
 yes that romantic 
 no horrid 
 you like it 
 of course i ridiculous it be allowed my patience what would meg say

 in the embassy princess ann stands in a large room across from the others in their bedclothes ambassador the countess who is upset wiping her nose with a handkerchief and the general who stands 
 
 ambassador

 ann

 the look at her in silence after a pause grimly 
 or indeed ever again 
 
 ann walks across the room 
 now since i understand we have a very full schedule today you have my permission to withdraw 
 
 they stand for a moment then bow and walk away at the door the countess takes a tray from a servant 
 no milk and crackers 
 
 the countess gives them back about to shut the door 
 that will be all thank you countess 
 
 the countess bows in respect and then goes out closing the door 
 alone in the room the princess walks slowly over to a window looking out over the city in silence 
 
 the next day joe sits in his apartment looking out of his window over the town there is a knock at the door and joe looks up hopefully the knocking persists and he walks to the door slowly and opens it then turns around in disappointment

 and the arrest of eight secret service men from a country which shall be nameless and then comes of news of the miraculous recovery it all adds up and think by playing that raised the price of that story a a deal
