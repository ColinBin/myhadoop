 the law of club and fang 
 
 
 first day on the yea beach was like a nightmare every hour was filled with shock and surprise he had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial no lazy life was this with nothing to do but loaf and be bored here was neither peace nor rest nor a safety all was confusion and action and every moment life and limb were in peril there was imperative need to be constantly alert for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men they were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang 
 he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgettable lesson it is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it curly was the victim they were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a wolf though not half so large as she there was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and face was ripped open from eye to jaw 
 it was the wolf manner of fighting to strike and leap away but there was more to it than this thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside he met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet she never regained them this was what the onlooking huskies had waited for they closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies 
 so sudden was it and so unexpected that buck was taken aback he saw spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing and he saw francois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them it did not take long two minutes from the time curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody trampled snow almost literally torn to pieces the swart standing over her and cursing horribly the scene often came back to buck to trouble him in his sleep so that was the way no fair play once down that was the end of you well he would see to it that he never went down spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred 
 before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of curly he received another shock francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles it was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home and as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel he buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange francois was stern demanding instant obedience and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience while dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped hindquarters whenever he was in error spitz was the leader likewise experienced and while he could not always get at buck he growled sharp reproof now and again or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck into the way he should go buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels 
 three very good dogs francois told perrault dat buck him pull like hell i teach him quick as anything 
 by afternoon perrault who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his dispatches returned with two more dogs billee and joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both sons of the one mother though they were they were different as day and night one fault was his excessive good nature while joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye buck received them in comradely fashion dave ignored them while spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when sharp teeth scored his flank but no matter how spitz circled joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically incarnation of belligerent fear so terrible was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp 
 by evening perrault secured another dog an old husky long and lean and gaunt with a face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect he was called which means the angry one like dave he asked nothing gave nothing expected nothing and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst even spitz left him alone he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky enough to discover he did not like to be approached on his blind side of this offense buck was unwittingly guilty and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down forever after buck avoided his blind side and to the last of their comradeship had no more his only apparent ambition like was to be left alone though as buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition 
 that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping the tent illumined by a candle glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain and when he as a matter of course entered it both perrault and francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested 
 finally an idea came to him he would return and see how his own teammates were making out to his astonishment they had disappeared again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned were they in the tent no that could not be else he would not have been driven out then where could they possibly be with drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down something wriggled under his feet he sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown but a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay billee he whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick face with his warm wet tongue 
 another lesson so that was the way they did it eh buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and wasted effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep the day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams 
 nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp at first he did not know where he was it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried the snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through fear of the wild thing for the trap it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before 
 a shout from francois hailed his appearance what i say the cried to perrault dat buck for sure learn quick as anything 
 perrault nodded gravely as courier for the canadian government bearing important dispatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck 
 three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the yea canyon buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and they were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them they were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight 
 dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was buck then came the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by spitz 
 buck had been purposely placed between dave and so that he might receive instruction apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth dave was fair and very wise he never nipped buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it as francois whip backed him up buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both dave and flew at him and administered a sound trouncing the resulting tangle was even worse but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him francois whip snapped less frequently and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them 
 it was a hard run up the canyon through sheep camp past the scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great chilcoot divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett where thousands of were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled 
 that day they made forty miles the trail being packed but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time as a rule perrault traveled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them francois guiding the sled at the sometimes exchanged places with him but not often perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all 
 day after day for days unending buck toiled in the traces always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them and always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow buck was ravenous the pound and a half of sundried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere he never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition 
 he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life a dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration there was no defending it while he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others to remedy this he ate as fast as they and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him he watched and learned when he saw pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk a great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected while dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for misdeed 
 this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment it marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death it marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence it was all well enough in the southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feeling but in the northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper 
 not that buck reasoned it out he was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life all his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defense of judge riding whip but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defense of a moral consideration and so save his hide he did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach he did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang in short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them 
 his development or retrogression was rapid his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain he achieved an internal as well as external economy he could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug 
 and not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again the domesticated generations fell from him in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors they quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks they came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always and when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him and his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness and the cold and dark 
 thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north and because manuel was a helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself

 finally an idea came to him he would return and see how his own teammates were making out to his astonishment they had disappeared again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned were they in the tent no that could not be else he would not have been driven out then where could they possibly be with drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down something wriggled under his feet he sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown but a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay billee he whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick face with his warm wet tongue 
 another lesson so that was the way they did it eh buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and wasted effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep the day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams 
 nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp at first he did not know where he was it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried the snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through fear of the wild thing for the trap it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before 
 a shout from francois hailed his appearance what i say the cried to perrault dat buck for sure learn quick as anything 
 perrault nodded gravely as courier for the canadian government bearing important dispatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck 
 three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the yea canyon buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and they were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them they were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight 
 dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was buck then came the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by spitz 
 buck had been purposely placed between dave and so that he might receive instruction apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth dave was fair and very wise he never nipped buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it as francois whip backed him up buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both dave and flew at him and administered a sound trouncing the resulting tangle was even worse but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him francois whip snapped less frequently and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them 
 it was a hard run up the canyon through sheep camp past the scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great chilcoot divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett where thousands of were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled 
 that day they made forty miles the trail being packed but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time as a rule perrault traveled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them francois guiding the sled at the sometimes exchanged places with him but not often perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all 
 day after day for days unending buck toiled in the traces always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them and always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow buck was ravenous the pound and a half of sundried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere he never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition 
 he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life a dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration there was no defending it while he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others to remedy this he ate as fast as they and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him he watched and learned when he saw pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk a great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected while dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for misdeed 
 this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment it marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death it marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence it was all well enough in the southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feeling but in the northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper 
 not that buck reasoned it out he was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life all his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defense of judge riding whip but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defense of a moral consideration and so save his hide he did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach he did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang in short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them 
 his development or retrogression was rapid his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain he achieved an internal as well as external economy he could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug 
 and not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again the domesticated generations fell from him in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors they quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks they came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always and when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him and his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness and the cold and dark 
 thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north and because manuel was a helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself

lionfish nov chapter two warningcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing the little creature on the bed had large ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning 
 
 as they stared at each other harry heard voice from the hall 
 
 may i take your coats mr and mrs mason 
 
 the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and 
 
 er hello said harry nervously 
 
 harry potter said the creature in a voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir such an honor it is 
 
 you said harry edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair next to hedwig who was asleep in her large cage he wanted to ask what are you but thought it would sound too rude so instead he said who are you 
 
 dobby sir just dobby dobby the said the creature 
 
 oh really said harry er i want to be rude or anything but this a great time for me to have a in my bedroom 
 
 aunt petunias high false laugh sounded from the living room the elf hung his head 
 
 not that not pleased to meet you said harry quickly but er is there any particular reason here 
 
 oh yes sir said dobby earnestly dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin 
 
 sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed 
 
 to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears 
 
 down he wailed never never ever 
 
 harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter 
 
 sorry he whispered i mean to offend you or anything 
 
 offend dobby choked the elf dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal 
 
 harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration 
 
 you have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up 
 
 dobby shook his head then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad dobby bad dobby 
 
 what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage 
 
 dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir 
 
 your family 
 
 the wizard family dobby serves sir dobby is a bound to serve one house and one family forever 
 
 do they know here asked harry curiously 
 
 dobby shuddered 
 
 oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this if they ever knew sir 
 
 but they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door 
 
 dobby doubts it sir dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir they lets dobby get on with it sir sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments 
 
 but why you leave escape 
 
 a must be set free sir and the family will never set dobby free dobby will serve the family until he dies sir 
 
 harry stared 
 
 and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said this makes the dursleys sound almost human anyone help you i 
 
 almost at once harry wished he spoken dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude 
 
 please harry whispered frantically please be quiet if the dursleys hear anything if they know here 
 
 harry potter asks if he can help dobby dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew 
 
 harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish not even top of my year at hogwarts hermione she 
 
 but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful 
 
 harry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his eyes aglow harry potter speaks not of his triumph over 
 
 voldemort said harry 
 
 dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir speak not the name 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i know lots of people like it my friend ron 
 
 he stopped again thinking about ron was painful too 
 
 dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights 
 
 dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again 
 
 harry nodded and eyes suddenly shone with tears 
 
 ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing harry potter is valiant and bold he has braved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts 
 
 there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle voice 
 
 harry stammered but got to go back term starts on september first all keeping me going you know what like here i belong here i belong in your world at hogwarts 
 
 no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped harry potter must stay where he is safe he is too great too good to lose if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger 
 
 why said harry in surprise 
 
 there is a plot harry potter a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over dobby has known it for months sir harry potter must not put himself in peril he is too important sir 
 
 what terrible things said harry at once plotting them 
 
 dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall 
 
 all right cried harry grabbing the arm to stop him you tell me i understand but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him hang on this got anything to do with vol sorry with has it you could just shake or nod he added hastily as head tilted worryingly close to the wall again 
 
 slowly dobby shook his head 
 
 not not sir 
 
 but eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint harry however was completely lost 
 
 he got a brother has he 
 
 dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever 
 
 well then i think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry i mean dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is you 
 
 dobby bowed his head 
 
 albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had dobby knows it sir dobby has heard powers rival those of at the height of his strength but sir voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore powers no decent wizard 
 
 and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps 
 
 a sudden silence fell downstairs two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke 
 
 quick in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned 
 
 what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke one more sound and wish never been born boy 
 
 he stomped from the room 
 
 shaking harry let dobby out of the closet 
 
 see what like here he said see why got to go back to hogwarts the only place got well i think got friends 
 
 friends who even write to harry potter said dobby slyly 
 
 i expect just been wait a minute said harry frowning how do you know my friends been writing to me 
 
 dobby shuffled his feet 
 
 harry potter be angry with dobby dobby did it for the best 
 
 have you been stopping my letters 
 
 dobby has them here sir said the elf stepping nimbly out of reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing harry could make out neat writing untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid 
 
 dobby blinked anxiously up at harry 
 
 harry potter be angry dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him harry potter might not want to go back to school sir 
 
 harry listening he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach 
 
 harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts ah sir this is a danger you must not face say you go back sir 
 
 no said harry angrily give me my 
 
 then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly 
 
 before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs 
 
 mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason been dying to hear 
 
 harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear 
 
 aunt masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby 
 
 no croaked harry please kill me 
 
 harry potter must say not going back to school 
 
 dobby please 
 
 say it sir 
 
 i 
 
 dobby gave him a tragic look 
 
 then dobby must do it sir for harry own good 
 
 the pudding fell to the floor with a crash cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered with a crack like a whip dobby vanished 
 
 there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt pudding 
 
 at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean 
 
 uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it been for the owl 
 
 aunt petunia was just passing around a box of mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs head and swooped out again mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke 
 
 harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes 
 
 read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered go on read it 
 
 harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine 
 
 as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery paragraph c 
 
 we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community muggles is a serious offense under section of the international confederation of of secrecy 
 
 enjoy your holidays 
 
 yours sincerely 
 
 mafalda hopkirk 
 
 improper use of magic office 
 
 ministry of magic 
 
 harry looked up from the letter and gulped 
 
 you tell us you allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes forgot to mention it slipped your mind i daresay 
 
 he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared well got news for you boy locking you up never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out expel you 
 
 and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs 
 
 uncle vernon was as bad as his word the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on window he himself fitted a in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock 
 
 three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry see any way out of his situation he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him 
 
 what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an low now that the dursleys knew they going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going probably starve to death anyway 
 
 the rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was but he drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust 
 
 no good turning your beak up at it all got said harry grimly 
 
 he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup 
 
 supposing he was still alive in another four weeks hat would happen if he turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see why he come back would they be able to make the dursleys let him go 
 
 the room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep 
 
 he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he saw face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him 
 
 stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head leave me alone cut it out trying to sleep 
 
 he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on the window and someone was goggling through the bars at him a someone 
 
 ron weasley was outside window 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets

 what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage 
 
 dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir 
 
 your family 
 
 the wizard family dobby serves sir dobby is a bound to serve one house and one family forever 
 
 do they know here asked harry curiously 
 
 dobby shuddered 
 
 oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this if they ever knew sir 
 
 but they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door 
 
 dobby doubts it sir dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir they lets dobby get on with it sir sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments 
 
 but why you leave escape 
 
 a must be set free sir and the family will never set dobby free dobby will serve the family until he dies sir 
 
 harry stared 
 
 and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said this makes the dursleys sound almost human anyone help you i 
 
 almost at once harry wished he spoken dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude 
 
 please harry whispered frantically please be quiet if the dursleys hear anything if they know here 
 
 harry potter asks if he can help dobby dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew 
 
 harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish not even top of my year at hogwarts hermione she 
 
 but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful 
 
 harry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his eyes aglow harry potter speaks not of his triumph over 
 
 voldemort said harry 
 
 dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir speak not the name 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i know lots of people like it my friend ron 
 
 he stopped again thinking about ron was painful too 
 
 dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights 
 
 dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again 
 
 harry nodded and eyes suddenly shone with tears 
 
 ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing harry potter is valiant and bold he has braved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts 
 
 there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle voice 
 
 harry stammered but got to go back term starts on september first all keeping me going you know what like here i belong here i belong in your world at hogwarts 
 
 no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped harry potter must stay where he is safe he is too great too good to lose if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger 
 
 why said harry in surprise 
 
 there is a plot harry potter a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over dobby has known it for months sir harry potter must not put himself in peril he is too important sir 
 
 what terrible things said harry at once plotting them 
 
 dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall 
 
 all right cried harry grabbing the arm to stop him you tell me i understand but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him hang on this got anything to do with vol sorry with has it you could just shake or nod he added hastily as head tilted worryingly close to the wall again 
 
 slowly dobby shook his head 
 
 not not sir 
 
 but eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint harry however was completely lost 
 
 he got a brother has he 
 
 dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever 
 
 well then i think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry i mean dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is you 
 
 dobby bowed his head 
 
 albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had dobby knows it sir dobby has heard powers rival those of at the height of his strength but sir voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore powers no decent wizard 
 
 and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps 
 
 a sudden silence fell downstairs two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke 
 
 quick in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned 
 
 what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke one more sound and wish never been born boy 
 
 he stomped from the room 
 
 shaking harry let dobby out of the closet 
 
 see what like here he said see why got to go back to hogwarts the only place got well i think got friends 
 
 friends who even write to harry potter said dobby slyly 
 
 i expect just been wait a minute said harry frowning how do you know my friends been writing to me 
 
 dobby shuffled his feet 
 
 harry potter be angry with dobby dobby did it for the best 
 
 have you been stopping my letters 
 
 dobby has them here sir said the elf stepping nimbly out of reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing harry could make out neat writing untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid 
 
 dobby blinked anxiously up at harry 
 
 harry potter be angry dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him harry potter might not want to go back to school sir 
 
 harry listening he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach 
 
 harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts ah sir this is a danger you must not face say you go back sir 
 
 no said harry angrily give me my 
 
 then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly 
 
 before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs 
 
 mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason been dying to hear 
 
 harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear 
 
 aunt masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby 
 
 no croaked harry please kill me 
 
 harry potter must say not going back to school 
 
 dobby please 
 
 say it sir 
 
 i 
 
 dobby gave him a tragic look 
 
 then dobby must do it sir for harry own good 
 
 the pudding fell to the floor with a crash cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered with a crack like a whip dobby vanished 
 
 there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt pudding 
 
 at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean 
 
 uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it been for the owl 
 
 aunt petunia was just passing around a box of mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs head and swooped out again mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke 
 
 harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes 
 
 read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered go on read it 
 
 harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine 
 
 as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery paragraph c 
 
 we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community muggles is a serious offense under section of the international confederation of of secrecy 
 
 enjoy your holidays 
 
 yours sincerely 
 
 mafalda hopkirk 
 
 improper use of magic office 
 
 ministry of magic 
 
 harry looked up from the letter and gulped 
 
 you tell us you allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes forgot to mention it slipped your mind i daresay 
 
 he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared well got news for you boy locking you up never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out expel you 
 
 and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs 
 
 uncle vernon was as bad as his word the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on window he himself fitted a in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock 
 
 three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry see any way out of his situation he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him 
 
 what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an low now that the dursleys knew they going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going probably starve to death anyway 
 
 the rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was but he drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust 
 
 no good turning your beak up at it all got said harry grimly 
 
 he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup 
 
 supposing he was still alive in another four weeks hat would happen if he turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see why he come back would they be able to make the dursleys let him go 
 
 the room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep 
 
 he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he saw face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him 
 
 stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head leave me alone cut it out trying to sleep 
 
 he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on the window and someone was goggling through the bars at him a someone 
 
 ron weasley was outside window 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter two aunt big mistakecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a television a present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually 
 
 harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict 
 
 the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately 
 
 no need to tell us no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair 
 
 he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed 
 
 the reporter had reappeared 
 
 the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today 
 
 hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you tell us where that escaped from what use is that lunatic could be coming up the street right now 
 
 aunt petunia who was bony and whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring neighbors 
 
 when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that the only way to deal with these people 
 
 very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next 
 
 uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added better be off in a minute petunia train gets in at ten 
 
 harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump 
 
 aunt marge he blurted out not coming here is she 
 
 aunt marge was uncle sister even though she was not a blood relative of whose mother had been aunt sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she often stay at privet drive because she bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in mind 
 
 at fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to eyes 
 
 be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her 
 
 dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was favorite form of entertainment 
 
 firstly growled uncle vernon keep a civil tongue in your head when talking to marge 
 
 all right said harry bitterly if she does when talking to me 
 
 secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard reply as marge know anything about your abnormality i want any any funny stuff while here you behave yourself got me 
 
 i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face told marge you attend st secure center for incurably criminal boys 
 
 what harry yelled 
 
 and be sticking to that story boy or be trouble spat uncle vernon 
 
 harry sat there and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle old socks 
 
 well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders 
 
 no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry 
 
 got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing thick blond hair bought him a lovely new 
 
 uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder 
 
 see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen 
 
 harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door 
 
 uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat 
 
 not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him 
 
 like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something 
 
 uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously 
 
 third years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry 
 
 so snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door 
 
 i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush 
 
 and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon 
 
 well said harry choosing his words carefully be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whatsits 
 
 st secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle voice 
 
 exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle large purple face a lot to remember have to make it sound convincing i what if i accidentally let something slip 
 
 get the stuffing knocked out of you you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground 
 
 knocking the stuffing out of me make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly 
 
 uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce 
 
 but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like normal and everything 
 
 harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple 
 
 right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during visit if at the end of it toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form 
 
 he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out 
 
 harry return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle heed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake 
 
 hedwig he said gloomily going to have to clear off for a week go with errol look after you ill write him a note explaining and look at me like that large amber eyes were reproachful not my fault the only way be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione 
 
 ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe 
 
 but harry have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest 
 
 do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall 
 
 harry see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be 
 
 all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path 
 
 get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry 
 
 a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open 
 
 on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and bulldog 
 
 my dudders roared aunt marge my neffy poo 
 
 dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek 
 
 harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp note clutched in his fat fist 
 
 petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone 
 
 uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door 
 
 tea marge he said and what will ripper take 
 
 ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could 
 
 
 by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals 
 
 looking after the other dogs marge uncle vernon asked 
 
 oh got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge retired now good for him to have something to do but i leave poor old ripper he pines if away from me 
 
 ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt attention to harry for the first time 
 
 so she barked still here are you 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you say yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you have done it myself have gone straight to an orphanage if been dumped on my doorstep 
 
 harry was bursting to say that rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile 
 
 you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon 
 
 st said uncle vernon promptly a institution for hopeless cases 
 
 i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st boy she barked across the table 
 
 er 
 
 uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt back 
 
 yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time 
 
 excellent said aunt marge i have this nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is needed in cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often 
 
 oh yeah said harry loads of times 
 
 aunt marge narrowed her eyes 
 
 i still like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly hitting you hard enough petunia write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this case 
 
 perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptly 
 
 heard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner eh 
 
 
 
 as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person 
 
 you blame yourself for the way the turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if something rotten on the inside nothing anyone can do about it 
 
 harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade say anything rise 
 
 aunt marge reached for her glass of wine 
 
 one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if something wrong with the bitch be something wrong with the pup 
 
 at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping 
 
 marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right 
 
 not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip 
 
 but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could 
 
 outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since lost control and made something explode he afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form the only thing at stake if he carried on like that be in trouble with the ministry of magic 
 
 harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record exactly clean either only last summer gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts 
 
 he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way 
 
 
 
 harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal 
 
 at last at long last the final evening of stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of faults during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy 
 
 can i tempt you marge 
 
 aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red 
 
 just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than thatand a bit the ticket 
 
 dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out 
 
 aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia normally just a for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a boy she went on winking at dudley be a man dudders like your father yes have a spot more brandy vernon 
 
 now this one here 
 
 she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quickly 
 
 this got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbred 
 
 harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers 
 
 it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other day bad blood will out now saying nothing against your family petunia she patted aunt bony hand with her one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and the result right in front of us 
 
 harry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he remember what came next aunt voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle drills 
 
 this potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he did 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents 
 
 he work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed 
 
 as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a lazy scrounger who 
 
 he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life 
 
 more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on 
 
 no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect 
 
 they die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet 
 
 they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little 
 
 but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami 
 
 marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 uncle vernon seized one of feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle leg 
 
 harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters 
 
 come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right 
 
 but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon 
 
 she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
 
 he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door 
 
 going harry said had enough 
 
 and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him cage under his arm 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban

 when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that the only way to deal with these people 
 
 very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next 
 
 uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added better be off in a minute petunia train gets in at ten 
 
 harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump 
 
 aunt marge he blurted out not coming here is she 
 
 aunt marge was uncle sister even though she was not a blood relative of whose mother had been aunt sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she often stay at privet drive because she bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in mind 
 
 at fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to eyes 
 
 be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her 
 
 dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was favorite form of entertainment 
 
 firstly growled uncle vernon keep a civil tongue in your head when talking to marge 
 
 all right said harry bitterly if she does when talking to me 
 
 secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard reply as marge know anything about your abnormality i want any any funny stuff while here you behave yourself got me 
 
 i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face told marge you attend st secure center for incurably criminal boys 
 
 what harry yelled 
 
 and be sticking to that story boy or be trouble spat uncle vernon 
 
 harry sat there and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle old socks 
 
 well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders 
 
 no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry 
 
 got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing thick blond hair bought him a lovely new 
 
 uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder 
 
 see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen 
 
 harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door 
 
 uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat 
 
 not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him 
 
 like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something 
 
 uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously 
 
 third years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry 
 
 so snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door 
 
 i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush 
 
 and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon 
 
 well said harry choosing his words carefully be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whatsits 
 
 st secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle voice 
 
 exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle large purple face a lot to remember have to make it sound convincing i what if i accidentally let something slip 
 
 get the stuffing knocked out of you you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground 
 
 knocking the stuffing out of me make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly 
 
 uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce 
 
 but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like normal and everything 
 
 harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple 
 
 right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during visit if at the end of it toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form 
 
 he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out 
 
 harry return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle heed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake 
 
 hedwig he said gloomily going to have to clear off for a week go with errol look after you ill write him a note explaining and look at me like that large amber eyes were reproachful not my fault the only way be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione 
 
 ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe 
 
 but harry have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest 
 
 do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall 
 
 harry see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be 
 
 all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path 
 
 get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry 
 
 a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open 
 
 on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and bulldog 
 
 my dudders roared aunt marge my neffy poo 
 
 dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek 
 
 harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp note clutched in his fat fist 
 
 petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone 
 
 uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door 
 
 tea marge he said and what will ripper take 
 
 ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could 
 
 
 by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals 
 
 looking after the other dogs marge uncle vernon asked 
 
 oh got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge retired now good for him to have something to do but i leave poor old ripper he pines if away from me 
 
 ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt attention to harry for the first time 
 
 so she barked still here are you 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you say yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you have done it myself have gone straight to an orphanage if been dumped on my doorstep 
 
 harry was bursting to say that rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile 
 
 you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon 
 
 st said uncle vernon promptly a institution for hopeless cases 
 
 i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st boy she barked across the table 
 
 er 
 
 uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt back 
 
 yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time 
 
 excellent said aunt marge i have this nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is needed in cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often 
 
 oh yeah said harry loads of times 
 
 aunt marge narrowed her eyes 
 
 i still like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly hitting you hard enough petunia write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this case 
 
 perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptly 
 
 heard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner eh 
 
 
 
 as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person 
 
 you blame yourself for the way the turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if something rotten on the inside nothing anyone can do about it 
 
 harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade say anything rise 
 
 aunt marge reached for her glass of wine 
 
 one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if something wrong with the bitch be something wrong with the pup 
 
 at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping 
 
 marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right 
 
 not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip 
 
 but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could 
 
 outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since lost control and made something explode he afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form the only thing at stake if he carried on like that be in trouble with the ministry of magic 
 
 harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record exactly clean either only last summer gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts 
 
 he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way 
 
 
 
 harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal 
 
 at last at long last the final evening of stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of faults during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy 
 
 can i tempt you marge 
 
 aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red 
 
 just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than thatand a bit the ticket 
 
 dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out 
 
 aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia normally just a for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a boy she went on winking at dudley be a man dudders like your father yes have a spot more brandy vernon 
 
 now this one here 
 
 she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quickly 
 
 this got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbred 
 
 harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers 
 
 it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other day bad blood will out now saying nothing against your family petunia she patted aunt bony hand with her one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and the result right in front of us 
 
 harry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he remember what came next aunt voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle drills 
 
 this potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he did 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents 
 
 he work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed 
 
 as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a lazy scrounger who 
 
 he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life 
 
 more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on 
 
 no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect 
 
 they die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet 
 
 they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little 
 
 but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami 
 
 marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 uncle vernon seized one of feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle leg 
 
 harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters 
 
 come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right 
 
 but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon 
 
 she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
 
 he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door 
 
 going harry said had enough 
 
 and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him cage under his arm 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter two the scarcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a wire to his skin 
 
 he sat up one hand still on his scar the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window 
 
 harry ran his fingers over the scar again it was still painful he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair he examined the scar of his reflection more closely it looked normal but it was still stinging 
 
 harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken it had seemed so realthere had been two people he knew and one he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember 
 
 the dim picture of a darkened room came to himthere had been a snake on a hearth ruga small man called peter nicknamed wormtailand a cold high voicethe voice of lord voldemort harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought 
 
 he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossibleall harry knew was that at the moment when chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in his scar 
 
 and who had the old man been for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground it was all becoming confused harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the nameand they had been plotting to kill someone elsehim 
 
 harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there as it happened there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night the pictures in this book were all moving men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another 
 
 harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a hoop then he snapped the book shut even quidditch in opinion the best sport in the world distract him at the moment he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below 
 
 privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning all the curtains were closed as far as harry could see through the darkness there a living creature in sight not even a cat 
 
 and yetand yetharry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again it the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night the same arm had been pierced by a venomous fang not long afterward only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble 
 
 no the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close bybut voldemort be here nowthe idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible 
 
 harry listened closely to the silence around him was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room 
 
 harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless 
 
 asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it as though they were ever any help to him awake uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were only living relatives they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot they had explained away long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st secure center for incurably criminal boys they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable 
 
 and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place if it been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead if it been for voldemort harry would still have had parents 
 
 harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort harry had survived with nothing but a cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous 
 
 it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again 
 
 but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting 
 
 at once hermione voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky 
 
 your scar hurt harry really seriouswrite to professor dumbledore nd go and check common magical ailments and afflictionsmaybe something in there about curse scars 
 
 yes that would be advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book harry stared out of the window at the inky sky he doubted very much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address but what would he write 
 
 dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning yours sincerely harry potter 
 
 even inside his head the words sounded stupid 
 
 and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron reaction and in a moment red hair and freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression 
 
 your scar hurt butbut be near you now can he i know you be trying to do you in again be i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a ask dad 
 
 mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew in any case harry like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve the weasleys were favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar 
 
 harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic 
 
 and then the solution came to him it was so simple and so obvious that he believe it had taken so long sirius 
 
 harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he thought of sirius straight away but then perhaps it so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago 
 
 there was a simple reason for complete absence from life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story 
 
 for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever 
 
 nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he be with him it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent 
 
 harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself somehow harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to well he needed to right now all right 
 
 lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 thanks for your last letter that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window things are the same as usual here diet going too well my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday they told him have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window a sort of computer thing you can play games on bit stupid really now he even got part three to take his mind off things 
 okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to 
 a weird thing happened this morning though my scar hurt again last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts but i reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward 
 send this with hedwig when she gets back off hunting at the moment say hello to buckbeak for me 
 harry 
 yes thought harry that looked all right there was no point putting in the dream he want it to look as though he was too worried he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast

 harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a hoop then he snapped the book shut even quidditch in opinion the best sport in the world distract him at the moment he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below 
 
 privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning all the curtains were closed as far as harry could see through the darkness there a living creature in sight not even a cat 
 
 and yetand yetharry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again it the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night the same arm had been pierced by a venomous fang not long afterward only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble 
 
 no the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close bybut voldemort be here nowthe idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible 
 
 harry listened closely to the silence around him was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room 
 
 harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless 
 
 asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it as though they were ever any help to him awake uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were only living relatives they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot they had explained away long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st secure center for incurably criminal boys they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable 
 
 and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place if it been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead if it been for voldemort harry would still have had parents 
 
 harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort harry had survived with nothing but a cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous 
 
 it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again 
 
 but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting 
 
 at once hermione voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky 
 
 your scar hurt harry really seriouswrite to professor dumbledore nd go and check common magical ailments and afflictionsmaybe something in there about curse scars 
 
 yes that would be advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book harry stared out of the window at the inky sky he doubted very much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address but what would he write 
 
 dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning yours sincerely harry potter 
 
 even inside his head the words sounded stupid 
 
 and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron reaction and in a moment red hair and freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression 
 
 your scar hurt butbut be near you now can he i know you be trying to do you in again be i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a ask dad 
 
 mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew in any case harry like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve the weasleys were favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar 
 
 harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic 
 
 and then the solution came to him it was so simple and so obvious that he believe it had taken so long sirius 
 
 harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he thought of sirius straight away but then perhaps it so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago 
 
 there was a simple reason for complete absence from life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story 
 
 for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever 
 
 nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he be with him it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent 
 
 harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself somehow harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to well he needed to right now all right 
 
 lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 thanks for your last letter that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window things are the same as usual here diet going too well my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday they told him have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window a sort of computer thing you can play games on bit stupid really now he even got part three to take his mind off things 
 okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to 
 a weird thing happened this morning though my scar hurt again last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts but i reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward 
 send this with hedwig when she gets back off hunting at the moment say hello to buckbeak for me 
 harry 
 yes thought harry that looked all right there was no point putting in the dream he want it to look as though he was too worried he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast

lionfish nov chapter two a peck of owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 what said harry blankly 
 
 he left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him flay him alive if he went and now look dementors just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we got time to stand around hurry now got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him 
 
 but 
 
 the revelation that his batty old neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway a witch 
 
 a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when warned him 
 
 this mundungus has been following me hang onit was him he disapparated from the front of my house 
 
 yes yes yes but luckily stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house gone and nowoh dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick 
 
 you know dumbledore said harry staring at her 
 
 of course i know dumbledore who know dumbledore but come on be no help if they come back never so much as transfigured a teabag 
 
 she stooped down seized one of massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged 
 
 get up you useless lump get up 
 
 but dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and his mouth shut very tight 
 
 do it harry took hold of arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously 
 
 hurry up said mrs figg hysterically 
 
 harry pulled one of massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner 
 
 keep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid that at the end of the street oh just mr prentice put your wand away boy i keep telling you no use 
 
 it was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on shoulder his large feet dragging along the ground 
 
 why you tell me a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your housewhy you say anything 
 
 orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if thought you enjoyed it it easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about thishow could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnightwhere is he how am i going to tell dumbledore happened i apparate 
 
 got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under weight 
 
 harry you understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic know already you mark my words 
 
 but i was getting rid of dementors i had to use going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely 
 
 oh my dear i wish it were so but afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you 
 
 there was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloak 
 
 s up figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover 
 
 give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief 
 
 dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here 
 
 yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watch 
 
 blimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i 
 
 and you off buying stolen cauldrons i tell you not to go i 
 
 iwell i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see 
 
 mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food 
 
 ouchgerroff gerroff you mad old bat gotta tell dumbledore 
 
 yesthey have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantell 
 
 keep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering going going 
 
 and with another loud crack he vanished 
 
 i hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting for 
 
 harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under bulk he gave the dudley a heave and staggered onwards 
 
 take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the among the pixies now 
 
 so harry panted been having me followed 
 
 of course he has said mrs figg impatiently did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in june good lord boy they told me you were intelligent right get inside and stay there she said as they reached number four i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough 
 
 what are you going to do asked harry quickly 
 
 going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnight 
 
 hang on go yet i want to know 
 
 but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clanking 
 
 wait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number garden path 
 
 the hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door 
 
 diddy about time too i was getting quitequite diddy the matter 
 
 harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat 
 
 diddy diddy the matter with you vernon vernon 
 
 uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick 
 
 ill vernon 
 
 what is it son happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for tea 
 
 why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground 
 
 hang onyou been mugged have you son 
 
 aunt petunia screamed 
 
 phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you 
 
 in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs 
 
 who did it son give us names get them worry 
 
 shh trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy 
 
 foot was on the stair when dudley found his voice 
 
 him 
 
 harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion 
 
 boy come here 
 
 with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys 
 
 the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyes 
 
 what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl 
 
 nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon believe him 
 
 what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of leather jacket was itwas it darling did he usehis thing 
 
 slowly tremulously dudley nodded 
 
 i harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i do anything to him it me it was 
 
 but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden 
 
 owls bellowed uncle vernon the vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my house 
 
 but harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his apple 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at minutes past nine this evening in a area and in the presence of a muggle 
 
 the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand 
 
 as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at on the twelfth of august 
 
 hoping you are well 
 
 yours sincerely 
 
 mafalda hopkirk 
 
 improper use of magic office 
 
 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going back 
 
 he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching again 
 
 temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to runnow where he was going to go harry know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen 
 
 where think going yelled uncle venon when harry reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i finished with you boy 
 
 get out of the way said harry quietly 
 
 going to stay here and explain how my son 
 
 if you get out of the way going to jinx you said harry raising the wand 
 
 you pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school 
 
 the madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like got three seconds onetwo 
 
 a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window 
 
 ignoring uncle anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink 
 
 harry 
 
 just arrived at the ministry and trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wand 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 dumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in chest almost immediately strangled by panichow was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion 
 
 his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he knew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before 
 
 right harry said changed my mind staying 
 
 he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever 
 
 who are all these ruddy owls from he growled 
 
 the first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend dad who works at the ministry 
 
 ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the going to the dogs 
 
 when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelled 
 
 because i did magic 
 
 aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley 
 
 nothing said harry slightly less calmly that me 
 
 was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudley 
 
 go on son said uncle vernon what did he do 
 
 tell us darling whispered aunt petunia 
 
 pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled 
 
 yeah i did but i use harry began angrily but 
 
 shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison 
 
 go on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiously 
 
 all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i things inside head 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mind 
 
 what sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very and with tears in her eyes 
 
 but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear 
 
 how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person 
 
 said dudley shakily and then 
 
 he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you 
 
 horrible croaked dudley cold really cold 
 
 ok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders 
 
 felt felt felt as if as if 
 
 as if never be happy again harry supplied dully 
 
 yes dudley whispered still trembling 
 
 so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hear voices and believe he waswas doomed to misery or something did you 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it me it was a couple of dementors 
 
 a couple this codswallop 
 
 dementors said harry slowly and clearly two of them 
 
 and what the ruddy hell are dementors 
 
 they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia 
 
 two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her brain reeled mrs figg was one thingbutaunt petunia 
 
 how know that he asked her astonished 
 
 aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth 
 
 i heardthat awful boytelling her about themyears ago she said jerkily 
 
 if you mean my mum and dad why you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered 
 
 harry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it exist 
 
 uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked sosotheyertheyerthey actually exist do theyer 
 
 aunt petunia nodded 
 
 uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the window like a feathery and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second envelope from the beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night 
 
 enougheffingowls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 further to our letter of approximately minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be taken 
 
 following discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries 
 
 with best wishes 
 
 yours sincerely

 harry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august 
 
 well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthought 
 
 got to go to a hearing said harry 
 
 and sentence you there 
 
 i suppose so 
 
 i give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily 
 
 well if all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius 
 
 no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down 
 
 what now said harry impatiently 
 
 dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son 
 
 fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified 
 
 dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought be smart with me i pulled out my wand but use it then two dementors turned up 
 
 but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do 
 
 i told youthey suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you 
 
 kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss you 
 
 what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth 
 
 aunt petunia uttered a soft scream 
 
 his soul they still got his 
 
 she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him 
 
 of course they get his soul know if they had said harry exasperated 
 
 fought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old did you 
 
 you give a dementor the old said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he all right then blustered uncle vernon why he all empty then 
 
 because i used the patronus 
 
 whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace 
 
 for sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell you 
 
 but harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everythingthe dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything outthat for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read message 
 
 arthur has just told us happened leave the house again whatever you do 
 
 harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing else 
 
 and now his temper was rising again anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though misbehaved and were saving their until they could ascertain how much damage had been done 
 
 a peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i have it boy i 
 
 i stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing letter in his fist 
 
 i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come been expelled you did admitted it 
 
 harry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleys 
 
 i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm the only thing that works against them 
 
 but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tone 
 
 tell you said harry wearily no idea 
 
 his head was pounding in the glare of the now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him 
 
 you said uncle vernon forcefully got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway got to be the onlythe only evidently he bring himself to say the word wizard the only for miles 
 
 i know why they were here 
 
 but at uncle words exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they would 
 
 these demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of train of thought 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think 
 
 oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion it it boy on the run from the law 
 
 of course not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing now 
 
 then why 
 
 he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon 
 
 that who must have sent them 
 
 lord voldemort said harry 
 
 he registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor 
 
 lordhang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes heard that name that was the one who 
 
 murdered my parents yes harry said dully 
 
 but gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so gone 
 
 back said harry heavily 
 
 it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt surgically clean kitchen beside the fridge and the television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly world of privet drive and the world beyond two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts head throbbed more painfully 
 
 back whispered aunt petunia 
 
 she was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all lifethat there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernonseemed to have fallen away 
 
 yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him 
 
 her hands found massive shoulders and clutched them 
 
 hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord back you say 
 
 yes 
 
 the one who murdered your parents 
 
 yes 
 
 and now sending dismembers after you 
 
 looks like it said harry 
 
 i see said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy 
 
 what said harry 
 
 you heard meout uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i done this years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford angliaout out had it history not staying here if some after you not endangering my wife and son not bringing trouble down on us if going the same way as your useless parents had it out 
 
 harry stood rooted to the spot the letters from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were all crushed in his left hand leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and house 
 
 you heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but been rotten from the beginning and had enoughowls 
 
 the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimney 
 
 harry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it 
 
 you can open it if you like said harry but hear what it says anyway a howler 
 
 let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon touch it it could be dangerous 
 
 addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive 
 
 she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke 
 
 open it harry urged her get it over with happen anyway 
 
 no 
 
 aunt hand was trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too latethe envelope burst into flames aunt petunia screamed and dropped it 
 
 an awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the table 
 
 remember my last petunia 
 
 aunt petunia looked as though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hands the remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence 
 
 what is this uncle vernon said hoarsely whati 
 
 aunt petunia said nothing dudley was staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiralled horribly harry was watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burst 
 
 petunia dear said uncle vernon timidly 
 
 she raised her head she was still trembling she swallowed 
 
 the boythe boy will have to stay vernon she said weakly 
 
 
 
 he stays she said she was not looking at harry she got to her feet again 
 
 he but petunia 
 
 if we throw him out the neighbours will talk she said she was rapidly regaining her usual brisk snappish manner though she was still very pale ask awkward questions want to know where gone have to keep him 
 
 uncle vernon was deflating like an old tyre 
 
 but petunia dear 
 
 aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harry 
 
 to stay in your room she said not to leave the house now get to bed 
 
 harry move 
 
 who was that howler from 
 
 ask questions aunt petunia snapped 
 
 are you in touch with wizards 
 
 i told you to get to bed 
 
 what did it mean remember the last what 
 
 go to bed 
 
 how come 
 
 you heard your aunt now go up to bed

lionfish nov chapter two a peck of owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 what said harry blankly 
 
 he left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him flay him alive if he went and now look dementors just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we got time to stand around hurry now got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him 
 
 but 
 
 the revelation that his batty old neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway a witch 
 
 a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when warned him 
 
 this mundungus has been following me hang onit was him he disapparated from the front of my house 
 
 yes yes yes but luckily stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house gone and nowoh dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick 
 
 you know dumbledore said harry staring at her 
 
 of course i know dumbledore who know dumbledore but come on be no help if they come back never so much as transfigured a teabag 
 
 she stooped down seized one of massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged 
 
 get up you useless lump get up 
 
 but dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and his mouth shut very tight 
 
 do it harry took hold of arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously 
 
 hurry up said mrs figg hysterically 
 
 harry pulled one of massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner 
 
 keep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid that at the end of the street oh just mr prentice put your wand away boy i keep telling you no use 
 
 it was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on shoulder his large feet dragging along the ground 
 
 why you tell me a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your housewhy you say anything 
 
 orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if thought you enjoyed it it easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about thishow could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnightwhere is he how am i going to tell dumbledore happened i apparate 
 
 got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under weight 
 
 harry you understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic know already you mark my words 
 
 but i was getting rid of dementors i had to use going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely 
 
 oh my dear i wish it were so but afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you 
 
 there was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloak 
 
 s up figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover 
 
 give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief 
 
 dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here 
 
 yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watch 
 
 blimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i 
 
 and you off buying stolen cauldrons i tell you not to go i 
 
 iwell i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see 
 
 mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food 
 
 ouchgerroff gerroff you mad old bat gotta tell dumbledore 
 
 yesthey have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantell 
 
 keep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering going going 
 
 and with another loud crack he vanished 
 
 i hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting for 
 
 harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under bulk he gave the dudley a heave and staggered onwards 
 
 take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the among the pixies now 
 
 so harry panted been having me followed 
 
 of course he has said mrs figg impatiently did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in june good lord boy they told me you were intelligent right get inside and stay there she said as they reached number four i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough 
 
 what are you going to do asked harry quickly 
 
 going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnight 
 
 hang on go yet i want to know 
 
 but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clanking 
 
 wait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number garden path 
 
 the hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door 
 
 diddy about time too i was getting quitequite diddy the matter 
 
 harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat 
 
 diddy diddy the matter with you vernon vernon 
 
 uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick 
 
 ill vernon 
 
 what is it son happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for tea 
 
 why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground 
 
 hang onyou been mugged have you son 
 
 aunt petunia screamed 
 
 phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you 
 
 in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs 
 
 who did it son give us names get them worry 
 
 shh trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy 
 
 foot was on the stair when dudley found his voice 
 
 him 
 
 harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion 
 
 boy come here 
 
 with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys 
 
 the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyes 
 
 what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl 
 
 nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon believe him 
 
 what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of leather jacket was itwas it darling did he usehis thing 
 
 slowly tremulously dudley nodded 
 
 i harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i do anything to him it me it was 
 
 but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden 
 
 owls bellowed uncle vernon the vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my house 
 
 but harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his apple 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at minutes past nine this evening in a area and in the presence of a muggle 
 
 the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand 
 
 as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at on the twelfth of august 
 
 hoping you are well 
 
 yours sincerely 
 
 mafalda hopkirk 
 
 improper use of magic office 
 
 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going back 
 
 he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching again 
 
 temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to runnow where he was going to go harry know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen 
 
 where think going yelled uncle venon when harry reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i finished with you boy 
 
 get out of the way said harry quietly 
 
 going to stay here and explain how my son 
 
 if you get out of the way going to jinx you said harry raising the wand 
 
 you pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school 
 
 the madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like got three seconds onetwo 
 
 a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window 
 
 ignoring uncle anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink 
 
 harry 
 
 just arrived at the ministry and trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wand 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 dumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in chest almost immediately strangled by panichow was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion 
 
 his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he knew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before 
 
 right harry said changed my mind staying 
 
 he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever 
 
 who are all these ruddy owls from he growled 
 
 the first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend dad who works at the ministry 
 
 ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the going to the dogs 
 
 when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelled 
 
 because i did magic 
 
 aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley 
 
 nothing said harry slightly less calmly that me 
 
 was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudley 
 
 go on son said uncle vernon what did he do 
 
 tell us darling whispered aunt petunia 
 
 pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled 
 
 yeah i did but i use harry began angrily but 
 
 shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison 
 
 go on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiously 
 
 all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i things inside head 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mind 
 
 what sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very and with tears in her eyes 
 
 but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear 
 
 how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person 
 
 said dudley shakily and then 
 
 he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you 
 
 horrible croaked dudley cold really cold 
 
 ok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders 
 
 felt felt felt as if as if 
 
 as if never be happy again harry supplied dully 
 
 yes dudley whispered still trembling 
 
 so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hear voices and believe he waswas doomed to misery or something did you 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it me it was a couple of dementors 
 
 a couple this codswallop 
 
 dementors said harry slowly and clearly two of them 
 
 and what the ruddy hell are dementors 
 
 they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia 
 
 two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her brain reeled mrs figg was one thingbutaunt petunia 
 
 how know that he asked her astonished 
 
 aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth 
 
 i heardthat awful boytelling her about themyears ago she said jerkily 
 
 if you mean my mum and dad why you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered 
 
 harry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it exist 
 
 uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked sosotheyertheyerthey actually exist do theyer 
 
 aunt petunia nodded 
 
 uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the window like a feathery and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second envelope from the beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night 
 
 enougheffingowls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 further to our letter of approximately minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be taken 
 
 following discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries 
 
 with best wishes 
 
 yours sincerely

 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august 
 
 well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthought 
 
 got to go to a hearing said harry 
 
 and sentence you there 
 
 i suppose so 
 
 i give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily 
 
 well if all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius 
 
 no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down 
 
 what now said harry impatiently 
 
 dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son 
 
 fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified 
 
 dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought be smart with me i pulled out my wand but use it then two dementors turned up 
 
 but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do 
 
 i told youthey suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you 
 
 kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss you 
 
 what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth 
 
 aunt petunia uttered a soft scream 
 
 his soul they still got his 
 
 she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him 
 
 of course they get his soul know if they had said harry exasperated 
 
 fought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old did you 
 
 you give a dementor the old said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he all right then blustered uncle vernon why he all empty then 
 
 because i used the patronus 
 
 whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace 
 
 for sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell you 
 
 but harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everythingthe dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything outthat for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read message 
 
 arthur has just told us happened leave the house again whatever you do 
 
 harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing else 
 
 and now his temper was rising again anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though misbehaved and were saving their until they could ascertain how much damage had been done 
 
 a peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i have it boy i 
 
 i stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing letter in his fist 
 
 i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come been expelled you did admitted it 
 
 harry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleys 
 
 i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm the only thing that works against them 
 
 but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tone 
 
 tell you said harry wearily no idea 
 
 his head was pounding in the glare of the now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him 
 
 you said uncle vernon forcefully got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway got to be the onlythe only evidently he bring himself to say the word wizard the only for miles 
 
 i know why they were here 
 
 but at uncle words exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they would 
 
 these demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of train of thought 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think 
 
 oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion it it boy on the run from the law 
 
 of course not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing now 
 
 then why 
 
 he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon 
 
 that who must have sent them 
 
 lord voldemort said harry 
 
 he registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor 
 
 lordhang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes heard that name that was the one who 
 
 murdered my parents yes harry said dully 
 
 but gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so gone 
 
 back said harry heavily 
 
 it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt surgically clean kitchen beside the fridge and the television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly world of privet drive and the world beyond two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts head throbbed more painfully 
 
 back whispered aunt petunia 
 
 she was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all lifethat there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernonseemed to have fallen away 
 
 yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him 
 
 her hands found massive shoulders and clutched them 
 
 hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord back you say 
 
 yes 
 
 the one who murdered your parents 
 
 yes 
 
 and now sending dismembers after you 
 
 looks like it said harry 
 
 i see said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy 
 
 what said harry 
 
 you heard meout uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i done this years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford angliaout out had it history not staying here if some after you not endangering my wife and son not bringing trouble down on us if going the same way as your useless parents had it out 
 
 harry stood rooted to the spot the letters from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were all crushed in his left hand leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and house 
 
 you heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but been rotten from the beginning and had enoughowls 
 
 the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimney 
 
 harry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it 
 
 you can open it if you like said harry but hear what it says anyway a howler 
 
 let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon touch it it could be dangerous 
 
 addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive 
 
 she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke 
 
 open it harry urged her get it over with happen anyway 
 
 no 
 
 aunt hand was trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too latethe envelope burst into flames aunt petunia screamed and dropped it 
 
 an awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the table 
 
 remember my last petunia 
 
 aunt petunia looked as though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hands the remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence 
 
 what is this uncle vernon said hoarsely whati 
 
 aunt petunia said nothing dudley was staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiralled horribly harry was watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burst 
 
 petunia dear said uncle vernon timidly 
 
 she raised her head she was still trembling she swallowed 
 
 the boythe boy will have to stay vernon she said weakly 
 
 
 
 he stays she said she was not looking at harry she got to her feet again 
 
 he but petunia 
 
 if we throw him out the neighbours will talk she said she was rapidly regaining her usual brisk snappish manner though she was still very pale ask awkward questions want to know where gone have to keep him 
 
 uncle vernon was deflating like an old tyre 
 
 but petunia dear 
 
 aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harry 
 
 to stay in your room she said not to leave the house now get to bed 
 
 harry move 
 
 who was that howler from

lionfish nov chapter two endcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown banks an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old wrappings in the tall grass 
 
 but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass 
 
 with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized 
 
 wait 
 
 the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead 
 
 the second figure turned over the animal with its toe 
 
 just a fox said a voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait 
 
 but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down 
 
 cissynarcissalisten to me 
 
 the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away 
 
 go back bella 
 
 you must listen to me 
 
 listened already made my decision leave me alone 
 
 the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness 
 
 he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot 
 
 but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road 
 
 cissy wait 
 
 bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other 
 
 cissy you must not do this you trust him 
 
 the dark lord trusts him he 
 
 the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark 
 
 let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the face bella merely laughed 
 
 cissy your own sister you 
 
 there is nothing i do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her arm as though burned 
 
 narcissa 
 
 but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room 
 
 she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes 
 
 narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person 
 
 narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise 
 
 severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you urgent 
 
 but of course 
 
 he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her sister followed without invitation 
 
 snape she said curtly as she passed him 
 
 bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them 
 
 they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited 
 
 snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa 
 
 so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters 
 
 we we are alone we narcissa asked quietly 
 
 yes of course well here but not counting vermin are we 
 
 he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen 
 
 as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily 
 
 the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove 
 
 narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming 
 
 wormtail will get us drinks if like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom 
 
 wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him 
 
 i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding eye 
 
 really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me 
 
 to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house 
 
 i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord 
 
 i can speak to him myself if i want to 
 
 of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the wine will do 
 
 wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the door behind him 
 
 snape poured out three glasses of wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused 
 
 the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it 
 
 the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses 
 
 as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me 
 
 snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs 
 
 my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i know what he means by it you were saying narcissa 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and started again 
 
 severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but 
 
 then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company 
 
 present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix 
 
 that i trust you snape as you very well know 
 
 narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into glowering face 
 
 narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me 
 
 a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that lived in pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years 
 
 she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands 
 
 snape smiled 
 
 before i answer youoh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you 
 
 she hesitated 
 
 i know he believes you but 
 
 you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen 
 
 bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark orders that i took up the post 
 
 she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her 
 
 you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left 
 
 have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him 
 
 yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine 
 
 gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing pet 
 
 not quite said snape calmly he give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways 
 
 this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead 
 
 hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is 
 
 but you stayed 
 
 yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eaters you know protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do 
 
 i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to stooge he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three years sooner as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him 
 
 mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine 
 
 but you return when he came back you fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn 
 
 correct i returned two hours later i returned on orders 
 
 on she began in tones of outrage 
 
 think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff i 
 
 the dark initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong 
 
 but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you 
 
 my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you 
 
 he shares everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he calls me his most loyal his most faithful 
 
 does he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief does he still after the fiasco at the ministry 
 
 that was not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most preciousif lucius 
 
 you you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister 
 
 there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done 
 
 but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape 
 
 my orders were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix andforgive meyou speak of dangers you were facing six teenagers were you not 
 
 they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters you 
 
 i am not the i cannot speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off 
 
 he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did nor soften 
 
 you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five years you have not done it why 
 
 have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape 
 
 he lately we i am asking you snape 
 
 if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible 
 
 you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered 
 
 i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago 
 
 but why did you keep him alive 
 
 have you not understood me it was only protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark attack indeed many of the dark old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle 
 
 of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and as was his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand 
 
 and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you asked bellatrix he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still 
 
 i have played my part well said snape and you overlook greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open armsthough as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help dumbledore has been a great wizardoh yes he has for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord 
 
 bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister 
 
 now you came to ask me for help narcissa 
 
 narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair 
 
 yes severus think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and 
 
 she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids 
 
 the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eyes still closed he wishes none to know of the plan it is very secret but 
 
 if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark word is law 
 
 narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house 
 
 there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence 
 
 but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning 
 
 it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord 
 
 i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
 
 you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know 
 
 certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all 
 
 severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son my only son 
 
 draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect 
 
 narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape 
 
 because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor mistake i know it 
 
 snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her 
 
 why chosen draco it she persisted to punish lucius 
 
 if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others 
 
 but he succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself 
 
 bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve 
 
 i only meant that nobody has yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been favorite teacher you are old friend i beg you you are the dark favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him 
 
 the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed 
 
 then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying 
 
 when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us 
 
 snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy 
 
 in other words it matter to him if draco is killed 
 
 the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily 
 
 she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor 
 
 my only son my only son 
 
 you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord 
 
 narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand 
 
 narcissa enough drink this listen to me 
 
 she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip 
 
 it might be possible for me to help draco 
 
 she sat up her face her eyes huge 
 
 severusoh severusyou would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm 
 
 i can try 
 
 she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it 
 
 if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow 
 
 the unbreakable vow 
 
 expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter 
 
 you listening narcissa oh try sure the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark orders of course 
 
 snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand 
 
 certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder 
 
 mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath astonished gaze they grasped right hands 
 
 you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly 
 
 she drew it still looking astonished 
 
 and you will need to move a little closer he said 
 
 she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands 
 
 narcissa spoke 
 
 will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts ta fulfill the dark wishes 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a wire 
 
 and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain 
 
 and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform 
 
 there was a silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a fiery snake

 with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized 
 
 wait 
 
 the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead 
 
 the second figure turned over the animal with its toe 
 
 just a fox said a voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait 
 
 but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down 
 
 cissynarcissalisten to me 
 
 the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away 
 
 go back bella 
 
 you must listen to me 
 
 listened already made my decision leave me alone 
 
 the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness 
 
 he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot 
 
 but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road 
 
 cissy wait 
 
 bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other 
 
 cissy you must not do this you trust him 
 
 the dark lord trusts him he 
 
 the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark 
 
 let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the face bella merely laughed 
 
 cissy your own sister you 
 
 there is nothing i do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her arm as though burned 
 
 narcissa 
 
 but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room 
 
 she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes 
 
 narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person 
 
 narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise 
 
 severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you urgent 
 
 but of course 
 
 he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her sister followed without invitation 
 
 snape she said curtly as she passed him 
 
 bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them 
 
 they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited 
 
 snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa 
 
 so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters 
 
 we we are alone we narcissa asked quietly 
 
 yes of course well here but not counting vermin are we 
 
 he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen 
 
 as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily 
 
 the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove 
 
 narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming 
 
 wormtail will get us drinks if like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom 
 
 wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him 
 
 i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding eye 
 
 really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me 
 
 to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house 
 
 i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord 
 
 i can speak to him myself if i want to 
 
 of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the wine will do 
 
 wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the door behind him 
 
 snape poured out three glasses of wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused 
 
 the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it 
 
 the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses 
 
 as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me 
 
 snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs 
 
 my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i know what he means by it you were saying narcissa 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and started again 
 
 severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but 
 
 then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company 
 
 present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix 
 
 that i trust you snape as you very well know 
 
 narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into glowering face 
 
 narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me 
 
 a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that lived in pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years 
 
 she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands 
 
 snape smiled 
 
 before i answer youoh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you 
 
 she hesitated 
 
 i know he believes you but 
 
 you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen 
 
 bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark orders that i took up the post 
 
 she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her 
 
 you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left 
 
 have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him 
 
 yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine 
 
 gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing pet 
 
 not quite said snape calmly he give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways 
 
 this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead 
 
 hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is 
 
 but you stayed 
 
 yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eaters you know protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do 
 
 i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to stooge he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three years sooner as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him 
 
 mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine 
 
 but you return when he came back you fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn 
 
 correct i returned two hours later i returned on orders 
 
 on she began in tones of outrage 
 
 think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff i 
 
 the dark initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong 
 
 but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you 
 
 my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you 
 
 he shares everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he calls me his most loyal his most faithful 
 
 does he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief does he still after the fiasco at the ministry 
 
 that was not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most preciousif lucius 
 
 you you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister 
 
 there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done 
 
 but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape 
 
 my orders were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix andforgive meyou speak of dangers you were facing six teenagers were you not 
 
 they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters you 
 
 i am not the i cannot speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off 
 
 he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did nor soften 
 
 you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five years you have not done it why 
 
 have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape 
 
 he lately we i am asking you snape 
 
 if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible 
 
 you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered 
 
 i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago 
 
 but why did you keep him alive 
 
 have you not understood me it was only protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark attack indeed many of the dark old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle 
 
 of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and as was his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand 
 
 and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you asked bellatrix he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still 
 
 i have played my part well said snape and you overlook greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open armsthough as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help dumbledore has been a great wizardoh yes he has for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord 
 
 bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister 
 
 now you came to ask me for help narcissa 
 
 narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair 
 
 yes severus think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and 
 
 she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids 
 
 the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eyes still closed he wishes none to know of the plan it is very secret but 
 
 if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark word is law 
 
 narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house 
 
 there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence 
 
 but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning 
 
 it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord 
 
 i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
 
 you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know 
 
 certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all 
 
 severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son my only son 
 
 draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect 
 
 narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape 
 
 because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor mistake i know it 
 
 snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her 
 
 why chosen draco it she persisted to punish lucius 
 
 if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others 
 
 but he succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself 
 
 bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve 
 
 i only meant that nobody has yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been favorite teacher you are old friend i beg you you are the dark favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him 
 
 the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed 
 
 then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying 
 
 when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us 
 
 snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy 
 
 in other words it matter to him if draco is killed 
 
 the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily 
 
 she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor 
 
 my only son my only son 
 
 you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord 
 
 narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand 
 
 narcissa enough drink this listen to me 
 
 she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip 
 
 it might be possible for me to help draco 
 
 she sat up her face her eyes huge 
 
 severusoh severusyou would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm 
 
 i can try 
 
 she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it 
 
 if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow 
 
 the unbreakable vow 
 
 expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter 
 
 you listening narcissa oh try sure the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark orders of course 
 
 snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand 
 
 certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder 
 
 mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath astonished gaze they grasped right hands 
 
 you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly 
 
 she drew it still looking astonished 
 
 and you will need to move a little closer he said 
 
 she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands 
 
 narcissa spoke 
 
 will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts ta fulfill the dark wishes 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a wire 
 
 and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain 
 
 and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform 
 
 there was a silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a fiery snake

 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter two in memorandumcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry was bleeding clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door 
 
 what the c 
 
 he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted possibly the cup of tea was dudleys idea of a clever booby trap keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap 
 
 it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magicbut he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it c particularly in light of his immediate plans c this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him 
 
 harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom c old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood 
 
 he now proceeded a little more cautiously kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage he recognized it at once it was a fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfathers last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit 
 
 harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him then he placed the fragment on top of that mornings daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk 
 
 it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime his muggle clothing invisibility cloak kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the marauders map and the locket with the note signed inside it the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable c in all usual senses it was worthless c but because of what it had cost to attain it 
 
 this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer 
 
 he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment 
 
 as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts at last he found it turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for 
 
 albus dumbledore remembered 
 by elphias doge 
 i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and attack upon three young muggles 
 
 albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so some indeed were disposed to praise his fathers action and assumed that albus too was a they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest tendency indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years 
 
 in a matter of months however albuss own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous he confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching 
 
 he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer dumbledores future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions 
 
 three years after we had started at hogwarts albuss brother aberforth arrived at school they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albuss shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers however tragedy intervened on the very eve of our trip albuss mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendras funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me 
 
 that was the period of our lives when we had least contact i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists his letters told me little of his life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my years travels that another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana 
 
 though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that arianas death and albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore 
 
 i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them 
 
 other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of 
 
 albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is nothing compared to the wizarding worlds that he was the most inspiring and best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day i met him 
 
 harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation 
 
 he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all never once had he imagined dumbledores childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and and old the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly skrewt 
 
 he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements no they had always discussed harry harrys past harrys future harrys plans and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly 
 
 what do you see when you look in the mirror 
 
 i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks 
 
 after several minutes thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room it was much tidier the only things left out of place were todays daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror 
 
 harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off todays prophet and unfolded the newspaper he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed 
 
 across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried 
 
 dumbledore c the truth at last 
 coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation striping away the popular image of serene wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave why was the man tipped to be the minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end 
 
 the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by berry braithwaite page inside 
 
 harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on 
 
 in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious might suggest greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip 
 
 well of course dumbledore is a biographers dream says skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of very very many 
 
 skeeter was certainly quick off the mark her book was completed in a mere four weeks after dumbledores mysterious death in june i ask her how she managed this superfast feat 
 
 oh when youve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need 
 
 i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledores that skeeters book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card 
 
 skeeter throws back her head and laughs 
 
 darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout 
 
 and yet elphias doges accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledores long and extraordinary life 
 
 oh my dear beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know c he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth 
 
 the advance publicity for skeeters biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask 
 
 now come off it betty im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book laughs skeeter but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledores brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago 
 
 oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs skeeter no no im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the father c dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness c but as i say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is its no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken 
 
 family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledores many magical discoveries 
 
 he had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers 
 
 but the importance of some of dumbledores achievements cannot i venture be denied what of his famous defeat of grindelwald 
 
 oh now im glad you mentioned grindelwald says skeeter with such a tantalizing smile im afraid those who go over dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell c or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all ill say is dont be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly 
 
 skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other 
 
 oh yes says skeeter nodding briskly i devote an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boys best interests c well well see its certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that had returned 
 
 oh yes weve developed a closer bond says skeeter poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life c the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter 
 
 which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledores final hours does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died 
 
 well i dont want to say too much c its all in the book c but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide c once theyve read my book 
 
 on that intriguing note i take my leave there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller dumbledores legion of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero 
 
 
 
 
 harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin 
 
 he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from ritas article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for 
 
 lies harry bellowed and through the window he saw the neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously 
 
 harry sat down hard on the bed the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him 
 
 a flash of brightest blue harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again he had imagined it he must have done he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunias choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him 
 
 he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again

 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter two in memorandumcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry was bleeding clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door 
 
 what the c 
 
 he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted possibly the cup of tea was dudleys idea of a clever booby trap keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap 
 
 it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magicbut he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it c particularly in light of his immediate plans c this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him 
 
 harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom c old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood 
 
 he now proceeded a little more cautiously kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage he recognized it at once it was a fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfathers last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit 
 
 harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him then he placed the fragment on top of that mornings daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk 
 
 it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime his muggle clothing invisibility cloak kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the marauders map and the locket with the note signed inside it the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable c in all usual senses it was worthless c but because of what it had cost to attain it 
 
 this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer 
 
 he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment 
 
 as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts at last he found it turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for 
 
 albus dumbledore remembered 
 by elphias doge 
 i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and attack upon three young muggles 
 
 albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so some indeed were disposed to praise his fathers action and assumed that albus too was a they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest tendency indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years 
 
 in a matter of months however albuss own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous he confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching 
 
 he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer dumbledores future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions 
 
 three years after we had started at hogwarts albuss brother aberforth arrived at school they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albuss shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers however tragedy intervened on the very eve of our trip albuss mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendras funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me 
 
 that was the period of our lives when we had least contact i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists his letters told me little of his life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my years travels that another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana 
 
 though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that arianas death and albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore 
 
 i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them 
 
 other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a great grief 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story really consists of two parts the first part might be left out but it gives us a few particulars and these are useful we were staying in the country at a seat where it happened that the master was absent for a few days in the meantime there arrived from the next town a lady she had a pug dog with her and came she said to dispose of shares in her she had her papers with her and we advised her to put them in an envelope and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the knight c 
 she listened to us attentively seized the pen paused and begged us to repeat the direction slowly we complied and she wrote but in the midst of the general war she struck fast sighed deeply and said i am only a woman her puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote and growled for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor his outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a great grief 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story really consists of two parts the first part might be left out but it gives us a few particulars and these are useful we were staying in the country at a seat where it happened that the master was absent for a few days in the meantime there arrived from the next town a lady she had a pug dog with her and came she said to dispose of shares in her she had her papers with her and we advised her to put them in an envelope and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the knight c 
 she listened to us attentively seized the pen paused and begged us to repeat the direction slowly we complied and she wrote but in the midst of the general war she struck fast sighed deeply and said i am only a woman her puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote and growled for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor his outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back 
 he bite said the lady he has no teeth he is like one of the family faithful and grumpy but the latter is my fault for they have teased him they play at wedding and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid and too much for him poor old fellow and she delivered her papers and took puggie upon her arm and this is the first part of the story which might have been left out

 of unity in religion 
 religion being the chief band of human society it is a happy thing when itself is 
 well contained within the true band of unity the quarrels and divisions about 
 religion were evils unknown to the heathen the reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief 
 for you may imagine what kind of faith theirs was when the chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets but the true god haul this attribute that he is a jealous god and therefore his worship and religion will endure no mixture nor partner we shall therefore speak a few words concerning the unity of the church what are the fruits thereof what the bounds and what means 
 the fruits of unity next unto the well pleasing of god which is all in all are 
 two me one towards those that are without the church the other towards those that are within for the former it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest scandals yea more than corruption of manners for as in the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humour so in the spiritual so that nothing doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church as breach of unity and therefore whensoever it cometh to that pass that one saith ecce in deserto another saith ecce in penetralibus that is when some men seek christ in the conventicles of heretics and others in an outward face of a church that voice had need continually to sound in ears nolite exire go not out the doctor of the gentiles the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care of those without saith if an heathen come in and hear you speak with several tongues will he not say that you are mad and certainly it is lime better when atheists and profane persons do hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion it doth avert them from the church and maketh them to sit down in the chair of the scorners it is but a light thing to be vouched in so serious a matter but yet it expressed well the deformity 
 there is a master of scoffing that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library sets down this title of a book the moms dance of heretics for indeed every sect of them hath a diverse posture or cringe by themselves which cannot but move derision in worldlings and depraved politics who are apt to contemn holy things as for the fruit towards those that are within it is peace which containe infinite blessings it establisheth faith it kindleth charity the outward peace of the church distilleth into peace of conscience and it turneth the labours of writing and reading of controversies into treaties of mortification and devotion 
 concerning the bounds of unity the true placing of them importeth exceedingly 
 there appear to be two extremes for to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious is it peace jehu what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me peace is not the matter but following and party contrariwise certain laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle ways and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrement between god and man both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of christians penned by our saviour himself were in the two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded he that is not with us is against us and again he that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention 
 this is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done already but if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally of this i may give only this advice according to my small model men ought to take heed of rending church by two kinds of controversies the one is when the matter of me point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife 
 about it kindled only by contradiction for as it is noted by one of the fathers 
 coat indeed had no seam but the vesture was of divers colours whereupon he saith in veste varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity the other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an subtlety and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious then substantial 
 a man that is of judgement and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself mat those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgement which is between man and man shall we not think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita profanas vocum oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern 
 the term the term in effect govemeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colours will agree in the dark me other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of image they may cleave but they will not incorporate 
 concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society there be two swords amongst christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion 
 but we may not take up the third sword which is sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary prosecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorise conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum 
 
 what would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people 
 
 let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring him in saying i will descend 
 and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of 
 religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down the holy ghost in stead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and to set out of the bark of a christian church a flag 
 of a barque of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of me same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

 a man that is of judgement and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself mat those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgement which is between man and man shall we not think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita profanas vocum oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern 
 the term the term in effect govemeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colours will agree in the dark me other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of image they may cleave but they will not incorporate 
 concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society there be two swords amongst christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion 
 but we may not take up the third sword which is sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary prosecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorise conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum 
 
 what would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people 
 
 let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring him in saying i will descend 
 and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of 
 religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down the holy ghost in stead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and to set out of the bark of a christian church a flag 
 of a barque of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of me same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

 m myriel becomes m welcome 
 the episcopal palace of d adjoins the hospital 
 the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris abbe of simore who had been bishop of d in 
 this palace was a genuine seignorial residence everything about it had a grand apartments of the bishop the the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees in the a long and superb gallery which was situated on the and opened on the gardens m henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles brulart de genlis archbishop prince antoine de mesgrigny the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand prior of france abbe of saint honore de lerins francois de berton de crillon bishop baron de vence cesar de sabran de forcalquier bishop seignor of glandeve and jean soanen priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishop seignor of senez the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable date the th of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble 
 the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden 
 three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house 
 monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you at the present moment 
 monseigneur 
 that was the number which i counted said the bishop 
 the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other 
 that is what i observed 
 the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them 
 so it seems to me 
 and then when there is a ray of sun the garden is very small for the convalescents 
 that was what i said to myself 
 in case of have had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at know not what to do 
 that is the thought which occurred to me 
 what would you have monseigneur said the director 
 one must resign self 
 this conversation took place in the gallery on the 
 the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital 
 monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold 
 exclaimed the stupefied director 
 the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes 
 it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to himself 
 then raising his voice 
 hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something there is evidently a mistake here 
 there are of you in five or six small rooms 
 there are three of us here and we have room for sixty 
 there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours 
 give me back my house you are at home here 
 on the following day the patients were installed in the palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital 
 m myriel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution 
 his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage 
 m myriel received from the state in his quality of bishop a salary of fifteen thousand francs 
 on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner we transcribe here a note made by his own hand 
 note on the regulation of my household expenses 
 for the little seminary livres 
 society of the mission 
 for the lazarists of montdidier 
 seminary for foreign missions in paris 
 congregation of the holy spirit 
 religious establishments of the holy land 
 charitable maternity societies 
 extra for that of arles 
 work for the amelioration of prisons 
 work for the relief and delivery of prisoners 
 to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt 
 addition to the salary of the poor teachers of thediocese 
 public granary of the 
 congregation of the ladies of d of manosque and of sisteron for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls 
 for the poor 
 my personal expenses 
 total 
 m myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of d as has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses 
 this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptistine 
 this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church she simply loved and venerated him 
 when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her adherence 
 their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little 
 it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptistine made fifteen hundred francs a year 
 on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted 
 and when a village curate came to d the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine 
 one day after he had been in d about three months the bishop said 
 and still i am quite cramped with it all 
 i should think so exclaimed madame magloire 
 monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese 
 it was customary for bishops in former days 
 hold cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire 
 and he made his demand 
 some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading 
 allowance to m the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits 
 this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d wrote to m bigot de preameneu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines 
 expenses of carriage 
 what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants 
 expenses of journeys 
 what is the use of these trips in the first place 
 next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts 
 there are no roads no one travels otherwise than on horseback 
 even the bridge between durance and can barely support these priests are all thus greedy and avaricious 
 this man played the good priest when he first came 
 now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days 
 oh all this priesthood things will not go well m le comte until the emperor has freed us from these rascals 
 down with the pope 
 matters were getting embroiled with rome for my part i am for caesar alone etc etc 
 on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire good said she to mademoiselle baptistine monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after all he has regulated all his charities 
 now here are three thousand francs for us 
 at last 
 that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms 
 expenses of carriage and circuit 
 for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital livres 
 for the maternity charitable society of aix 
 for the maternity charitable society of draguignan 
 for foundlings 
 for orphans 
 total 
 such was m budget 
 as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage bans dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy 
 after a time offerings of money flowed in 
 those who had and those who lacked knocked at m latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit 
 in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress 
 considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities 
 far from it 
 as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received 
 it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any 
 then he stripped himself 
 the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters the poor people of the had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenomens of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him 
 moreover this appellation pleased him 
 i like that name said he 
 bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur 
 we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original

 a new hope

 it was an old saying that you could burn your eyes out faster by staringstraight and hard at the flatlands of tatooine than by looking directly atits two huge suns themselves so powerful was the penetrating glare reflected fromthose endless wastes despite the flare life could and did exist in the flatlandsformed by seabeds one thing made it possible the reintroductionof water 
 for human purposes however the water of tatooine was only marginallyaccessible the atmosphere yielded its moisture with reluctance it had to becoaxed down out of the hard blue forced yanked down to the parchedsurface two figures whose concern was obtaining that moisture were standing on aslight rise of one of those inhospitable flats one of the pair was stiff and vaporator sunk securely through sand and into deeper rock the figurenext to it was a food deal more animated though no less 
 luke skywalker was twice the age of the vaporator but much lesssecure at the moment he was swearing softly at a recalcitrant valve adjuster on thetemperamental device from time to time he resorted to some unsubtle pounding inplace of using the appropriate tool neither method worked very well luke wassure that the lubricants used on the vaporator went out of their way to attract seductively to small abrasive particles with an oily gleam he wipedsweat from his forehead and leaned back for a moment the most prepossessingthing about the young man was his name a light breeze tugged at his shaggy hairand baggy work tunic as he regarded the device no point in staying angry at it hecounseled himself only an unintelligent machine 
 as luke considered his predicament a third figure appeared scooting out frombehind the vaporator to fumble awkwardly at the damaged section only three of thetreadwell model six arms were functioning and these had seen more wearthan the boots on feet the machine moved with unsteady 
 luke gazed at it sadly then inclined his head to study the sky still no sign of acloud and he knew there never would be unless he got that vaporator working hewas about to try once again when a small intense gleam of light caught his he slipped the carefully cleaned set of macrobinoculars from his utility beltand focused the lenses skyward 
 for long moments he stared wishing all the while that he had a real telescopeinstead of the binocs as he stared vaporators the heat and the remainingchores were forgotten clipping the binoculars back onto his belt luke turned anddashed for the landspeeder halfway to the vehicle he thought to call behind him 
 hurry up he shouted impatiently what are you waiting for get it ingear 
 the treadwell started toward him hesitated and then commenced spinning in atight circle smoke belching from every joint luke shouted further instruction thenfinally gave up in disgust when he realized that it would take more than words tomotivate the treadwell again 
 for a moment luke hesitated at leaving the machine he argued tohimself its vital components were obviously shot so he jumped into thelandspeeder causing the recently repaired repulsion floater to list alarmingly to oneside until he was able to equalize weight distribution by sliding behind the its altitude slightly above the sandy ground the transportvehicle steadied itself like a boat in a heavy sea luke gunned the engine whichwhined in protest and sand erupted behind the floater as he aimed the craft toward thedistant town of anchorhead 
 behind him a pitiful beacon of black smoke from the burning robot continued torise into the clear desert air it be there when luke returned there werescavengers of metal as well as flesh in the wide wastes of tatooine 
 metal and stone structures bleached white by the glaze of twin tatoo i and iihuddled together tightly for company as much as for protection they formed thenexus of the widespread farming community of anchorhead 
 presently the dusty unpaved streets were quiet deserted sandflies buzzedlazily in the cracked eaves of pourstone building a dog barked in the distance thesole sign of habitation until a lone old woman appeared and started across the metallic sun shawl was pulled tight around her 
 something made her look up tired eyes squinting into the distance the soundsuddenly leaped in volume as a shining rectangular shape came roaring around a farcorner her eyes popped as the vehicle bore down on her showing no sign ofaltering its path she had to scramble to get out of its way 
 panting and waving an angry fist after the landspeeder she raised her voice overthe sound of its passage you kids ever learn to slow down 
 luke might have seen her but he certainly hear her in both cases hisattention was focused elsewhere as he pulled up behind a low long concrete coils and rods jutted from its top and sides relentless sand wavesbroke in frozen yellow spume against the walls no one had bothered toclear them away there was no point they would only return again the followingday 
 luke slammed the front door aside and shouted hey 
 a rugged young man in dress sat sprawled in a chair behind unkempt control desk sunscreen oil had kept his skin from burning theskin of the girl on his lap had been equally protected and there was a great deal moreof the protected area in view somehow even dried sweat looked good on her 
 hey everybody luke yelled again having elicited something less than anoverwhelming response with his first cry he ran toward the instrument room at therear of the station while the mechanic half asleep ran a hand across his face andmumbled did i hear a young noise blast through here 
 the girl on his lap stretched sensuously her clothing tugging invarious intriguing directions her voice was casually throaty oh she was just wormie on one of his rampages 
 deak and windy looked up from the pool game as luke burstinto the room they were dressed much like luke although their clothing was ofbetter fit and somewhat less exercised 
 all three youths contrasted strikingly with the burly handsome player at the farside of the table from neatly clipped hair to his uniform he stood outin the room like an oriental poppy in a sea of oats behind the three humans a softhum came from where a repair robot was working patiently on a broken piece ofstation equipment 
 shape it up you guys luke yelled excitedly then he noticed the older manin the uniform the subject of his suddenly startled gaze recognized himsimultaneously 
 biggs 
 the face twisted in a half grin hello luke then they wereembracing each other warmly 
 luke finally stood away openly admiring the uniform i knowyou were back when did you get in 
 the confidence in the voice bordered the realm of smugness withoutquite entering it just a little while ago i wanted to surprise you hotshot heindicated the room i thought be here with these other two and windy both smiled i certainly expect you to be out laughed easily a laugh few people found resistible 
 the academy change you much luke commented but backso soon his expression grew concerned hey what you getyour commission 
 there was something evasive about biggs as he replied looking slightly course i got it signed to serve aboard the freighter rand ecliptic just last mate biggs darklighter at your service he performed a twisting salute halfserious and half humorous then grinned that over bearing yet ingratiating grin again 
 i just came back to say to all you unfortunate landlocked all laughed until luke suddenly remembered what had brought him here in suchhurry 
 i almost forgot he told them his initial excitement returning a battlegoing on right here in our system come and look 
 deak looked disappointed not another one of your epic battles you dreamed up enough of them forget it 
 forget it serious a battle all right 
 with words and shoves he managed to cajole the occupants of the station out intothe strong sunlight camie in particular looked disgusted 
 this had better be worth it luke she warned him shading her eyes against theglare 
 luke already had his macrobinoculars out and was searching the heavens ittook only a moment for him to fix on a particular spot i told you he they are 
 biggs moved alongside him and reached for the binoculars as the other strainedunaided eyes a slight readjustment provided just enough magnification for biggs toout two silvery specks against the dark blue 
 no battle hotshot he decided lowering the binocs and regarding hisfriend gently just sitting there two ships all a bargeloading a freighter since tatooine got an orbital station 
 there was a lot of luke added his initial enthusiasm wasbeginning to falter under the withering assurance of his older friend 
 camie grabbed the binoculars away from biggs banging them slightly against asupport pillar in the process luke took them away from her quickly inspecting thecasing for damage take it easy with those 
 worry so much wormie she sneered luke took a step toward halted as the huskier mechanic easily interposed himself between them andfavored luke with a warning smile luke considered shrugged the incident away 
 i keep telling you luke the mechanic said with the air of a man tired ofrepeating the same story to no avail the rebellion is a long way from here i doubtif the empire would fight to keep this system believe me tatooine is a big hunk ofnothing 
 his audience began to fade back into the station before luke could mutter a had his arm around camie and the two of them were chuckling over even deak and windy were murmuring among was certain 
 he followed them but not without a last glance back and up to the distant thing he was sure of were the flashes of light he had seen between the two been caused by the suns of tatooine reflecting off metal 
 the binding that locked the hands behind her back was primitive andeffective the constant attention the squad of heavily armed troopers favored herwith might have been out of place for one small female except for the fact that theirlives depended on her being delivered safely 
 when she deliberately slowed her pace however it became apparent that hercaptors did not mind mistreating her a little one of the armored figures shoved herbrutally in the small of the back and she nearly fell turning she gave the offendingsoldier a vicious look but she could not tell if it had any effect since the facewas completely hidden by his armored helmet 
 the hallway they eventually emerged into was still smoking around the edges ofthe smoldering cavity blasted through the hull of the fighter a portable accesswayhad been sealed to it and a circlet of light showed at the far end of the tunnel bridgingspace between the rebel craft and the cruiser a shadow moved over her as sheturned from inspecting the accessway startling her despite her usually 
 above her toward the threatening bulk of darth vader red eyes glaring behindthe hideous breath mask a muscle twitched in one smooth cheek but other thanthat the girl react nor was there the slightest shake in her voice 
 darth vaderi should have known only you would be so sostupid well the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear that youhave attacked a diplomatic miss 
 senator leia organa vader rumbled softly though strongly enough tooverride her protests his pleasure at finding her was evident in the way he savoredevery syllable 
 play games with me your highness he continued ominously on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restrictedsystem ignoring numerous warnings and completely disregarding orders to it no longer mattered 
 the huge metal skull dipped close i know that several transmissions werebeamed to this vessel by spies within that system when we traced thosetransmissions back to the individuals with whom they originated they had the poorgrace to kill themselves before they could be questioned i want to know whathappened to the data they sent you 
 neither words nor his inimical presence appeared to have any effect onthe girl i know what blathering about she snapped looking awayfrom him a member of the senate on a diplomatic mission to 
 to your part of the rebel alliance vader declared cutting her off also a traitor his gaze went to a nearby officer take her away 
 she succeeded in reaching him with her spit which hissed against battlearmor he wiped the offensive matter away silently watching her with interest asshe was marched through the accessway into the cruiser 
 a tall slim soldier wearing the sign of an imperial commander attracted as he came up next to him holding her is dangerous he looking after her as she was escorted toward the cruiser if word of thisdoes get out there will be much unrest in the senate it will generate sympathy forthe rebels the commander looked up at the unreadable metal face then added inan manner she should be destroyed immediately 
 no my first duty is to locate that hidden fortress of theirs vader repliedeasily all the rebel spies have been our hand or by their she is now my only key to discovering its location i intend to make fulluse of her if necessary i will use her i will learn the location of the rebelbase 
 the commander pursed his lips shook his head slightly perhaps a bitsympathetically as he considered the woman die before she gives you anyinformation reply was chilling in its indifference leave that to considered a moment then went on send out a distress that the ship encountered an unexpected meteorite cluster it couldnot avoid readings indicate that the shift shields were overridden and the ship washulled to the point of vacating percent of its atmosphere inform herfather and the senate that all aboard were killed 
 a cluster of troops marched purposefully up to their commanderand the dark lord vader eyed them expectantly 
 the data tapes in question are not aboard the ship there is no valuableinformation in the storage banks and no evidence of bank erasure the officerin charge recited mechanically nor were any transmissions directed outward fromthe ship from the time we made contact a malfunctioning lifeboat pod was ejectedduring the fighting but it was confirmed at the time that no life forms were on board 
 vader appeared thoughtful it could have been a malfunctioning pod hemused that might also have contained the tapes tapes are not life forms in allprobability any native finding them would be ignorant of their importance and wouldlikely clear them for his own use still 
 send down a detachment to retrieve them or to make certain they are not in thepod he finally ordered the commander and attentive officer be as subtle aspossible there is no need to attract attention even on this miserable outpost world 
 as the officer and troops departed vader turned his gaze back to the this want to leave anything as for the pod i cannottake the chance it was a simple malfunction the data it might contain could provetoo damaging see to this personally commander if those data tapes exist theymust be retrieved or destroyed at all costs then he added with satisfaction withthat accomplished and the senator in our hands we will see the end of this absurdrebellion 
 it shall be as you direct lord vader the commander acknowledged bothmen entered the accessway to the cruiser 
 what a forsaken place this is 
 threepio turned cautiously to look back at where the pod lay half buried in internal gyros were still unsteady from the rough landing landing mereapplication of the term unduly flattered his dull associate 
 on the other hand he supposed he ought to be grateful they had come down inone piece although he mused as he studied the barren landscape he still they were better off here than they would have been had they remained on thecaptured cruiser high sandstone mesas dominated the skyline to one side everyother direction showed only endless series of marching dunes like long yellow teethstretching for kilometer on kilometer into the distance sand ocean blended into until it was impossible to distinguish where one ended and the other began 
 a faint cloud of minute dust particles rose in their wake as the two robotsmarched away from the pod that vehicle its intended function fully now quite useless neither robot had been designed for pedal locomotion onthis kind of terrain so they had to fight their way across the unstable surface 
 we seem to have been made to suffer threepio moaned in arotten existence something squeaked in his right leg and he winced got torest before i fall apart my internals still recovered from that headlong crashyou called a landing 
 he paused but artoo detoo did not the little automation had performed asharp turn and was now ambling slowly but steadily in the direction of the nearestoutjut of mesa 
 hey threepio yelled artoo ignored the call and continued do you think you are going 
 now artoo paused emitting a stream of electronic explanation as threepioexhaustedly walked over to join him 
 well not going that way threepio declared when artoo had concluded hisexplanation too rocky he gestured in the direction they had been an angle away from the cliffs this way is much easier a metal hand waveddisparagingly at the high mesas what makes you think there are settlements thatway anyhow 
 a long whistle issued from the depths of artoo 
 get technical with me threepio warned had just about enoughof your decisions 
 artoo beeped once 
 all right go your way threepio announced grandly be sandloggedwithin a day you nearsighted scrap pile he gave the artoo unit a contemptuousshove sending the smaller robot tumbling down a slight dune as it struggled at thebottom to regain its feet threepio started off toward the blurred glaring back over his shoulder let me catch you following me begging forhelp he warned because you get it 
 below the crest of the dune the artoo unit righted itself it paused briefly toclean its single electronic eye with an auxiliary arm then it produced an electronicsqueal which was almost though not quite a human expression of rage hummingquietly to itself then it turned and trudged off toward the sandstone ridges as ifnothing had happened 
 several hours later a straining threepio his internal thermostat overloaded andedging dangerously toward overheat shutdown struggled up the top of what he hopedwas the last towering the dune nearby a pillars and buttresses of bleached bones of some enormous beast formed an unpromising landmark reaching thecrest of the dune threepio peered anxiously ahead instead of the of human civilization he saw only several dozen more dunes identical inform and promise to the one he now stood upon the farthest rose even higher thanthe one he presently surmounted 
 threepio turned and looked back toward the now rocky plateau whichwas beginning to grow indistinct with distance and heat distortion youmalfunctioning little twerp he muttered unable even now to admit to himself thatperhaps just possibly the artoo unit might have been right this is all your tricked me into going this way but do no better 
 nor would he if he continue on so he took a step forward and heardsomething grind dully within a leg joint sitting down in an electronic funk hebegan picking sand from his encrusted joints 
 he could continue on his present course he told himself or he could confessto an error in judgment and try to catch up again with artoo detoo neither prospectheld much appeal for him 
 but there was a third choice he could sit here shining in the sunlight until hisjoints locked his internals overheated and the ultraviolet burned out hisphotoreceptors he would become another monument to the destructive power ofthe binary like the colossal organism whose picked corpse he had just encountered 
 already his receptors were beginning to go he reflected it seemed he sawsomething moving in the distance heat distortion probably wasdefinitely light on metal and it was moving toward him his hopes the warnings from his damaged leg he rose and began waving frantically 
 it was he saw now definitely a vehicle though of a type unfamiliar to a vehicle it was and that implied intelligence and technology 
 he neglected in his excitement to consider the possibility that it might not be ofhuman origin 
 so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and dropped in low tail luke finished waving his arms wildly he and biggs were walking inthe shade outside the power station sounds of metal being worked came fromsomewhere within where fixer had finally joined his robot assistant in was so close to him luke continued excitedly i thought i was going to fry myinstrumentation as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad thatrecollection inspired a frown 
 uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the depression was brief memory of his feat overrode its immorality 
 you should have been there biggs 
 you ought to take it a little easier his friend cautioned you may be thehottest bush pilot this side of mos eisley luke but those little skyhoppers can bedangerous they move awfully fast for tropospheric than they need playing engine jockey with one and someday whammo he slammed one fistviolently into his open palm going to be nothing more than a dark spot onthe damp side of a canyon wall 
 look talking luke retorted now that been on a few bigautomatic starships beginning to sound like my uncle gotten soft inthe cities he swung spiritedly at biggs who blocked the movement easily makinga halfhearted gesture of counterattack 
 easygoing smugness dissolved into something warmer missedyou kid 
 luke looked away embarrassed things exactly been the same sinceyou left either biggs been so luke hunted for the right word and finallyfinished helplessly so quiet his gaze traveled across the sandy deserted streets ofanchorhead its always been quiet really 
 biggs grew silent thinking he glanced around they were along out else was back inside the comparative coolness of the power station as heleaned close luke sense an unaccustomed solemness in his tone 
 luke i come back just to say or to crow over everyone becausei got through the academy again he hesitate unsure of himself then he blurtedout rapidly not giving himself a chance to back down but i want somebody to tell my parents 
 gaping at biggs luke could only gulp know what what are you talkingabout 
 talking about the talking been going on at the otherplaces luke strong talking i made some new friends outsystem friends weagreed about the way certain things are developing and his voice we reach one of the peripheral systems going to jumpship and join the alliance 
 luke stared back at his friend tried to picture patriot afire with rebellious fervor 
 going to join the rebellion he started got to be 
 damp down will you the bigger man cautioned got a mouth like acrater 
 sorry luke whispered rapidly how quiet i am youcan barely hear me 
 biggs cut him off and continued a friend of mine from the academy has afriend on bestine who might enable us to make contact with an armed rebel friend of crazy luke announced with conviction certain his friendhad gone mad you could wander around forever trying to find a real rebel of them are only myths this twice removed friend could be an imperial end up on kessel or worse if rebel outposts were so easy to find the empirewould have wiped them out years ago 
 i know a long shot biggs admitted reluctantly if i contact peculiar light came into eyes a conglomeration of newfoundmaturity andsomething do what i can on my own 
 he stared intensely at his friend luke not going to wait for the empire toconscript me into its service in spite of what you hear over the official informationchannels the rebellion is growing spreading and i want to be on the right side i believe in his voice altered unpleasantly and luke wondered what hesaw in his eye 
 you should have heard some of the stories heard luke learned of some ofthe outrages learned about the empire may have been great and beautiful the people in charge now he shook his head sharply rotten 
 and i do a damn thing luke muttered morosely stuck kicked futilely at the sand of anchorhead 
 i though you were going to enter the academy soon biggs observed so then have your chance to get off this sandpile 
 luke snorted derisively not likely i had to withdraw my application helooked away unable to meet his disbelieving stare i had to beena lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left biggs even raided theoutskirts of anchorhead 
 biggs shook his head disregarding the excuse your uncle could hold off awhole colony of raiders with one blaster 
 from the house sure luke agreed but uncle finally got enoughvaporators installed and running to make the farm pay off big but he guard allthat land by himself and he says he needs me for one more season i run outon him now 
 biggs sighed sadly i feel for you luke someday going to have tolearn to separate what seems to be important from what really is important hegestured around them 
 what good is all your work if taken over by the empire that starting to imperialize commerce in all the outlying systems be long before your uncle and everyone else on tatooine are just tenantsslaving for the greater glory of the empire 
 that happen here luke objected with a confidence he quitefeel said it empire bother with this rock 
 things change luke only the threat is completely there aretwo things men have never been able to satisfy their curiosity and their much the high imperial bureaucrats are curious about 
 both men stood silent a sandwhirl traversed the street in silent against a wall to send newborn baby zephyrs in all directions 
 i wish i was going with you luke finally murmured he glanced up willyou be around long 
 no as a matter of fact leaving in the morning to rendezvous with theecliptic 
 then i seeing you again 
 maybe someday biggs declared he brightened grinning that disarming keep a look out for you brother try not to run into any canyon walls in themeantime 
 be at the academy the season after luke insisted more to encouragehimself than biggs after that who knows where end up he soundeddetermined i be drafted into the starfleet for sure tale care ofyourself be the best friend got there was no need for ahandshake these two had long since passed beyond that 
 so long then luke biggs said simply he turned and reentered the powerstation 
 luke watched him disappear through the door his own thoughts as chaotic andfrenetic as one of spontaneous dust storms 
 there were any numbers of extraordinary features unique to among them were the mysterious mists which rose regularly from theground at the points where desert sands washed up against unyielding cliffs and mesas 
 fog in a steaming desert seemed as out of place as cactus on a glacier but itexisted nonetheless meteorologists and geologists argued its origin amongthemselves muttering theories about water suspended in sandstoneveins beneath the sand and incomprehensible chemical reactions which made waterrise when the ground cooled then fall underground again with the double sunrise itwas all very backward and very real 
 neither the mist nor the alien moans of nocturnal desert dwellers troubled artoodetoo however as he made his careful way up the rocky arroyo hunting for theeasiest pathway to the mesa top his squarish broad footpads made clicking soundsloud in the evening light as sand underfoot gave way gradually to gravel 
 for a moment he paused he seemed to detect a metal on of him instead of rock on rock the sound repeated though and hequickly resumed his ambling ascent 
 up the arroyo too far up to be seen from below a pebble trickled loose from thestone wall the tiny figure which had accidentally dislodged the pebble into shadow two glowing points of light showed under overlappingfolds of brown cape a meter from the narrowing canyon wall 
 only the reaction of the unsuspecting robot indicated the presence of the whiningbeam as it struck him for a moment artoo detoo fluoresced eerily in the dimminglight there was a single short electronic squeak then the tripodal supportunbalanced and the tiny automation toppled over onto its back the lights on its frontblinking on and off erratically from the effects of the paralyzing beam 
 three travesties of men scurried out from behind concealing boulders theirmotions were more indicative of rodent than humankind and they stood little tallerthan the artoo unit when they saw that the single burst of enervation energy hadimmobilized the robot they holstered their peculiar weapons nevertheless theyapproached the listless machine cautiously with the trepidation of hereditary cowards 
 their cloaks were thickly coated with dust and sand unhealthy glowed catlike from the depths of their hoods as they studied their jawas conversed in low guttural croaks and scrambled analogs of human as anthropologists hypothesized they had ever been human they had long sincedegenerated past anything resembling the human race 
 several more jawas appeared together they succeeded in alternately hoistingand dragging the robot back down the arroyo 
 at the bottom of some monstrous prehistoric asandcrawler as enormous as its owners and operators were tiny several dozenmeters high the vehicle towered above the ground on multiple treads that were tallerthan a tall man its metal epidermis was battered and pitted from sandstorms 
 on reaching the crawler the jawas resumed jabbering among detoo could hear them but failed to comprehend anything he need not havebeen embarrassed at his failure if they so wished only jawas could understandother jawas for they employed a randomly variable language that drove linguists mad 
 one of them removed a small disk from a belt pouch and sealed it to the flank a large tube protruded from one side of the gargantuan vehicle theyrolled him over to it and then moved clear there was a brief moan the whoosh ofpowerful vacuum and the small robot was sucked into the bowels of the sandcrawleras neatly as a pea up a straw this part of the job completed the jawas engaged inanother bout of jabbering following which they scurried into the crawler via tubesand ladders for all the world like a nest of mice returning to their holes 
 none too gently the suction tube deposited artoo in a small cubical inaddition to varied piles of broken instruments and outright scrap a dozen or so robotsof differing shapes and sizes populated the prison a few were locked in electronicconversation others muddled aimlessly about but when artoo tumbled into thechamber one voice burst out in surprise 
 artoo you you called an excited threepio from the neardarkness he made his way over to the still immobilized repair unit and embraced itmost unmechanically spotting the small disk sealed onto side threepioturned his gaze thoughtfully down to his own chest where a similar device hadlikewise been attached 
 massive gears poorly lubricated started to move with a groaning andgrinding the monster sandcrawler turned and lumbered with relentless patience intothe desert night

 a rugged young man in dress sat sprawled in a chair behind unkempt control desk sunscreen oil had kept his skin from burning theskin of the girl on his lap had been equally protected and there was a great deal moreof the protected area in view somehow even dried sweat looked good on her 
 hey everybody luke yelled again having elicited something less than anoverwhelming response with his first cry he ran toward the instrument room at therear of the station while the mechanic half asleep ran a hand across his face andmumbled did i hear a young noise blast through here 
 the girl on his lap stretched sensuously her clothing tugging invarious intriguing directions her voice was casually throaty oh she was just wormie on one of his rampages 
 deak and windy looked up from the pool game as luke burstinto the room they were dressed much like luke although their clothing was ofbetter fit and somewhat less exercised 
 all three youths contrasted strikingly with the burly handsome player at the farside of the table from neatly clipped hair to his uniform he stood outin the room like an oriental poppy in a sea of oats behind the three humans a softhum came from where a repair robot was working patiently on a broken piece ofstation equipment 
 shape it up you guys luke yelled excitedly then he noticed the older manin the uniform the subject of his suddenly startled gaze recognized himsimultaneously 
 biggs 
 the face twisted in a half grin hello luke then they wereembracing each other warmly 
 luke finally stood away openly admiring the uniform i knowyou were back when did you get in 
 the confidence in the voice bordered the realm of smugness withoutquite entering it just a little while ago i wanted to surprise you hotshot heindicated the room i thought be here with these other two and windy both smiled i certainly expect you to be out laughed easily a laugh few people found resistible 
 the academy change you much luke commented but backso soon his expression grew concerned hey what you getyour commission 
 there was something evasive about biggs as he replied looking slightly course i got it signed to serve aboard the freighter rand ecliptic just last mate biggs darklighter at your service he performed a twisting salute halfserious and half humorous then grinned that over bearing yet ingratiating grin again 
 i just came back to say to all you unfortunate landlocked all laughed until luke suddenly remembered what had brought him here in suchhurry 
 i almost forgot he told them his initial excitement returning a battlegoing on right here in our system come and look 
 deak looked disappointed not another one of your epic battles you dreamed up enough of them forget it 
 forget it serious a battle all right 
 with words and shoves he managed to cajole the occupants of the station out intothe strong sunlight camie in particular looked disgusted 
 this had better be worth it luke she warned him shading her eyes against theglare 
 luke already had his macrobinoculars out and was searching the heavens ittook only a moment for him to fix on a particular spot i told you he they are 
 biggs moved alongside him and reached for the binoculars as the other strainedunaided eyes a slight readjustment provided just enough magnification for biggs toout two silvery specks against the dark blue 
 no battle hotshot he decided lowering the binocs and regarding hisfriend gently just sitting there two ships all a bargeloading a freighter since tatooine got an orbital station 
 there was a lot of luke added his initial enthusiasm wasbeginning to falter under the withering assurance of his older friend 
 camie grabbed the binoculars away from biggs banging them slightly against asupport pillar in the process luke took them away from her quickly inspecting thecasing for damage take it easy with those 
 worry so much wormie she sneered luke took a step toward halted as the huskier mechanic easily interposed himself between them andfavored luke with a warning smile luke considered shrugged the incident away 
 i keep telling you luke the mechanic said with the air of a man tired ofrepeating the same story to no avail the rebellion is a long way from here i doubtif the empire would fight to keep this system believe me tatooine is a big hunk ofnothing 
 his audience began to fade back into the station before luke could mutter a had his arm around camie and the two of them were chuckling over even deak and windy were murmuring among was certain 
 he followed them but not without a last glance back and up to the distant thing he was sure of were the flashes of light he had seen between the two been caused by the suns of tatooine reflecting off metal 
 the binding that locked the hands behind her back was primitive andeffective the constant attention the squad of heavily armed troopers favored herwith might have been out of place for one small female except for the fact that theirlives depended on her being delivered safely 
 when she deliberately slowed her pace however it became apparent that hercaptors did not mind mistreating her a little one of the armored figures shoved herbrutally in the small of the back and she nearly fell turning she gave the offendingsoldier a vicious look but she could not tell if it had any effect since the facewas completely hidden by his armored helmet 
 the hallway they eventually emerged into was still smoking around the edges ofthe smoldering cavity blasted through the hull of the fighter a portable accesswayhad been sealed to it and a circlet of light showed at the far end of the tunnel bridgingspace between the rebel craft and the cruiser a shadow moved over her as sheturned from inspecting the accessway startling her despite her usually 
 above her toward the threatening bulk of darth vader red eyes glaring behindthe hideous breath mask a muscle twitched in one smooth cheek but other thanthat the girl react nor was there the slightest shake in her voice 
 darth vaderi should have known only you would be so sostupid well the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear that youhave attacked a diplomatic miss 
 senator leia organa vader rumbled softly though strongly enough tooverride her protests his pleasure at finding her was evident in the way he savoredevery syllable 
 play games with me your highness he continued ominously on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restrictedsystem ignoring numerous warnings and completely disregarding orders to it no longer mattered 
 the huge metal skull dipped close i know that several transmissions werebeamed to this vessel by spies within that system when we traced thosetransmissions back to the individuals with whom they originated they had the poorgrace to kill themselves before they could be questioned i want to know whathappened to the data they sent you 
 neither words nor his inimical presence appeared to have any effect onthe girl i know what blathering about she snapped looking awayfrom him a member of the senate on a diplomatic mission to 
 to your part of the rebel alliance vader declared cutting her off also a traitor his gaze went to a nearby officer take her away 
 she succeeded in reaching him with her spit which hissed against battlearmor he wiped the offensive matter away silently watching her with interest asshe was marched through the accessway into the cruiser 
 a tall slim soldier wearing the sign of an imperial commander attracted as he came up next to him holding her is dangerous he looking after her as she was escorted toward the cruiser if word of thisdoes get out there will be much unrest in the senate it will generate sympathy forthe rebels the commander looked up at the unreadable metal face then added inan manner she should be destroyed immediately 
 no my first duty is to locate that hidden fortress of theirs vader repliedeasily all the rebel spies have been our hand or by their she is now my only key to discovering its location i intend to make fulluse of her if necessary i will use her i will learn the location of the rebelbase 
 the commander pursed his lips shook his head slightly perhaps a bitsympathetically as he considered the woman die before she gives you anyinformation reply was chilling in its indifference leave that to considered a moment then went on send out a distress that the ship encountered an unexpected meteorite cluster it couldnot avoid readings indicate that the shift shields were overridden and the ship washulled to the point of vacating percent of its atmosphere inform herfather and the senate that all aboard were killed 
 a cluster of troops marched purposefully up to their commanderand the dark lord vader eyed them expectantly 
 the data tapes in question are not aboard the ship there is no valuableinformation in the storage banks and no evidence of bank erasure the officerin charge recited mechanically nor were any transmissions directed outward fromthe ship from the time we made contact a malfunctioning lifeboat pod was ejectedduring the fighting but it was confirmed at the time that no life forms were on board 
 vader appeared thoughtful it could have been a malfunctioning pod hemused that might also have contained the tapes tapes are not life forms in allprobability any native finding them would be ignorant of their importance and wouldlikely clear them for his own use still 
 send down a detachment to retrieve them or to make certain they are not in thepod he finally ordered the commander and attentive officer be as subtle aspossible there is no need to attract attention even on this miserable outpost world 
 as the officer and troops departed vader turned his gaze back to the this want to leave anything as for the pod i cannottake the chance it was a simple malfunction the data it might contain could provetoo damaging see to this personally commander if those data tapes exist theymust be retrieved or destroyed at all costs then he added with satisfaction withthat accomplished and the senator in our hands we will see the end of this absurdrebellion 
 it shall be as you direct lord vader the commander acknowledged bothmen entered the accessway to the cruiser 
 what a forsaken place this is 
 threepio turned cautiously to look back at where the pod lay half buried in internal gyros were still unsteady from the rough landing landing mereapplication of the term unduly flattered his dull associate 
 on the other hand he supposed he ought to be grateful they had come down inone piece although he mused as he studied the barren landscape he still they were better off here than they would have been had they remained on thecaptured cruiser high sandstone mesas dominated the skyline to one side everyother direction showed only endless series of marching dunes like long yellow teethstretching for kilometer on kilometer into the distance sand ocean blended into until it was impossible to distinguish where one ended and the other began 
 a faint cloud of minute dust particles rose in their wake as the two robotsmarched away from the pod that vehicle its intended function fully now quite useless neither robot had been designed for pedal locomotion onthis kind of terrain so they had to fight their way across the unstable surface 
 we seem to have been made to suffer threepio moaned in arotten existence something squeaked in his right leg and he winced got torest before i fall apart my internals still recovered from that headlong crashyou called a landing 
 he paused but artoo detoo did not the little automation had performed asharp turn and was now ambling slowly but steadily in the direction of the nearestoutjut of mesa 
 hey threepio yelled artoo ignored the call and continued do you think you are going 
 now artoo paused emitting a stream of electronic explanation as threepioexhaustedly walked over to join him 
 well not going that way threepio declared when artoo had concluded hisexplanation too rocky he gestured in the direction they had been an angle away from the cliffs this way is much easier a metal hand waveddisparagingly at the high mesas what makes you think there are settlements thatway anyhow 
 a long whistle issued from the depths of artoo 
 get technical with me threepio warned had just about enoughof your decisions 
 artoo beeped once 
 all right go your way threepio announced grandly be sandloggedwithin a day you nearsighted scrap pile he gave the artoo unit a contemptuousshove sending the smaller robot tumbling down a slight dune as it struggled at thebottom to regain its feet threepio started off toward the blurred glaring back over his shoulder let me catch you following me begging forhelp he warned because you get it 
 below the crest of the dune the artoo unit righted itself it paused briefly toclean its single electronic eye with an auxiliary arm then it produced an electronicsqueal which was almost though not quite a human expression of rage hummingquietly to itself then it turned and trudged off toward the sandstone ridges as ifnothing had happened 
 several hours later a straining threepio his internal thermostat overloaded andedging dangerously toward overheat shutdown struggled up the top of what he hopedwas the last towering the dune nearby a pillars and buttresses of bleached bones of some enormous beast formed an unpromising landmark reaching thecrest of the dune threepio peered anxiously ahead instead of the of human civilization he saw only several dozen more dunes identical inform and promise to the one he now stood upon the farthest rose even higher thanthe one he presently surmounted 
 threepio turned and looked back toward the now rocky plateau whichwas beginning to grow indistinct with distance and heat distortion youmalfunctioning little twerp he muttered unable even now to admit to himself thatperhaps just possibly the artoo unit might have been right this is all your tricked me into going this way but do no better 
 nor would he if he continue on so he took a step forward and heardsomething grind dully within a leg joint sitting down in an electronic funk hebegan picking sand from his encrusted joints 
 he could continue on his present course he told himself or he could confessto an error in judgment and try to catch up again with artoo detoo neither prospectheld much appeal for him 
 but there was a third choice he could sit here shining in the sunlight until hisjoints locked his internals overheated and the ultraviolet burned out hisphotoreceptors he would become another monument to the destructive power ofthe binary like the colossal organism whose picked corpse he had just encountered 
 already his receptors were beginning to go he reflected it seemed he sawsomething moving in the distance heat distortion probably wasdefinitely light on metal and it was moving toward him his hopes the warnings from his damaged leg he rose and began waving frantically 
 it was he saw now definitely a vehicle though of a type unfamiliar to a vehicle it was and that implied intelligence and technology 
 he neglected in his excitement to consider the possibility that it might not be ofhuman origin 
 so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and dropped in low tail luke finished waving his arms wildly he and biggs were walking inthe shade outside the power station sounds of metal being worked came fromsomewhere within where fixer had finally joined his robot assistant in was so close to him luke continued excitedly i thought i was going to fry myinstrumentation as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad thatrecollection inspired a frown 
 uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the depression was brief memory of his feat overrode its immorality 
 you should have been there biggs 
 you ought to take it a little easier his friend cautioned you may be thehottest bush pilot this side of mos eisley luke but those little skyhoppers can bedangerous they move awfully fast for tropospheric than they need playing engine jockey with one and someday whammo he slammed one fistviolently into his open palm going to be nothing more than a dark spot onthe damp side of a canyon wall 
 look talking luke retorted now that been on a few bigautomatic starships beginning to sound like my uncle gotten soft inthe cities he swung spiritedly at biggs who blocked the movement easily makinga halfhearted gesture of counterattack 
 easygoing smugness dissolved into something warmer missedyou kid 
 luke looked away embarrassed things exactly been the same sinceyou left either biggs been so luke hunted for the right word and finallyfinished helplessly so quiet his gaze traveled across the sandy deserted streets ofanchorhead its always been quiet really 
 biggs grew silent thinking he glanced around they were along out else was back inside the comparative coolness of the power station as heleaned close luke sense an unaccustomed solemness in his tone 
 luke i come back just to say or to crow over everyone becausei got through the academy again he hesitate unsure of himself then he blurtedout rapidly not giving himself a chance to back down but i want somebody to tell my parents 
 gaping at biggs luke could only gulp know what what are you talkingabout 
 talking about the talking been going on at the otherplaces luke strong talking i made some new friends outsystem friends weagreed about the way certain things are developing and his voice we reach one of the peripheral systems going to jumpship and join the alliance 
 luke stared back at his friend tried to picture patriot afire with rebellious fervor 
 going to join the rebellion he started got to be 
 damp down will you the bigger man cautioned got a mouth like acrater 
 sorry luke whispered rapidly how quiet i am youcan barely hear me 
 biggs cut him off and continued a friend of mine from the academy has afriend on bestine who might enable us to make contact with an armed rebel friend of crazy luke announced with conviction certain his friendhad gone mad you could wander around forever trying to find a real rebel of them are only myths this twice removed friend could be an imperial end up on kessel or worse if rebel outposts were so easy to find the empirewould have wiped them out years ago 
 i know a long shot biggs admitted reluctantly if i contact peculiar light came into eyes a conglomeration of newfoundmaturity andsomething do what i can on my own 
 he stared intensely at his friend luke not going to wait for the empire toconscript me into its service in spite of what you hear over the official informationchannels the rebellion is growing spreading and i want to be on the right side i believe in his voice altered unpleasantly and luke wondered what hesaw in his eye 
 you should have heard some of the stories heard luke learned of some ofthe outrages learned about the empire may have been great and beautiful the people in charge now he shook his head sharply rotten 
 and i do a damn thing luke muttered morosely stuck kicked futilely at the sand of anchorhead 
 i though you were going to enter the academy soon biggs observed so then have your chance to get off this sandpile 
 luke snorted derisively not likely i had to withdraw my application helooked away unable to meet his disbelieving stare i had to beena lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left biggs even raided theoutskirts of anchorhead 
 biggs shook his head disregarding the excuse your uncle could hold off awhole colony of raiders with one blaster 
 from the house sure luke agreed but uncle finally got enoughvaporators installed and running to make the farm pay off big but he guard allthat land by himself and he says he needs me for one more season i run outon him now 
 biggs sighed sadly i feel for you luke someday going to have tolearn to separate what seems to be important from what really is important hegestured around them 
 what good is all your work if taken over by the empire that starting to imperialize commerce in all the outlying systems be long before your uncle and everyone else on tatooine are just tenantsslaving for the greater glory of the empire 
 that happen here luke objected with a confidence he quitefeel said it empire bother with this rock 
 things change luke only the threat is completely there aretwo things men have never been able to satisfy their curiosity and their much the high imperial bureaucrats are curious about 
 both men stood silent a sandwhirl traversed the street in silent against a wall to send newborn baby zephyrs in all directions 
 i wish i was going with you luke finally murmured he glanced up willyou be around long 
 no as a matter of fact leaving in the morning to rendezvous with theecliptic 
 then i seeing you again 
 maybe someday biggs declared he brightened grinning that disarming keep a look out for you brother try not to run into any canyon walls in themeantime 
 be at the academy the season after luke insisted more to encouragehimself than biggs after that who knows where end up he soundeddetermined i be drafted into the starfleet for sure tale care ofyourself be the best friend got there was no need for ahandshake these two had long since passed beyond that 
 so long then luke biggs said simply he turned and reentered the powerstation 
 luke watched him disappear through the door his own thoughts as chaotic andfrenetic as one of spontaneous dust storms 
 there were any numbers of extraordinary features unique to among them were the mysterious mists which rose regularly from theground at the points where desert sands washed up against unyielding cliffs and mesas 
 fog in a steaming desert seemed as out of place as cactus on a glacier but itexisted nonetheless meteorologists and geologists argued its origin amongthemselves muttering theories about water suspended in sandstoneveins beneath the sand and incomprehensible chemical reactions which made waterrise when the ground cooled then fall underground again with the double sunrise itwas all very backward and very real 
 neither the mist nor the alien moans of nocturnal desert dwellers troubled artoodetoo however as he made his careful way up the rocky arroyo hunting for theeasiest pathway to the mesa top his squarish broad footpads made clicking soundsloud in the evening light as sand underfoot gave way gradually to gravel 
 for a moment he paused he seemed to detect a metal on of him instead of rock on rock the sound repeated though and hequickly resumed his ambling ascent 
 up the arroyo too far up to be seen from below a pebble trickled loose from thestone wall the tiny figure which had accidentally dislodged the pebble into shadow two glowing points of light showed under overlappingfolds of brown cape a meter from the narrowing canyon wall 
 only the reaction of the unsuspecting robot indicated the presence of the whiningbeam as it struck him for a moment artoo detoo fluoresced eerily in the dimminglight there was a single short electronic squeak then the tripodal supportunbalanced and the tiny automation toppled over onto its back the lights on its frontblinking on and off erratically from the effects of the paralyzing beam 
 three travesties of men scurried out from behind concealing boulders theirmotions were more indicative of rodent than humankind and they stood little tallerthan the artoo unit when they saw that the single burst of enervation energy hadimmobilized the robot they holstered their peculiar weapons nevertheless theyapproached the listless machine cautiously with the trepidation of hereditary cowards 
 their cloaks were thickly coated with dust and sand unhealthy glowed catlike from the depths of their hoods as they studied their jawas conversed in low guttural croaks and scrambled analogs of human as anthropologists hypothesized they had ever been human they had long sincedegenerated past anything resembling the human race 
 several more jawas appeared together they succeeded in alternately hoistingand dragging the robot back down the arroyo 
 at the bottom of some monstrous prehistoric asandcrawler as enormous as its owners and operators were tiny several dozenmeters high the vehicle towered above the ground on multiple treads that were tallerthan a tall man its metal epidermis was battered and pitted from sandstorms 
 on reaching the crawler the jawas resumed jabbering among detoo could hear them but failed to comprehend anything he need not havebeen embarrassed at his failure if they so wished only jawas could understandother jawas for they employed a randomly variable language that drove linguists mad 
 one of them removed a small disk from a belt pouch and sealed it to the flank a large tube protruded from one side of the gargantuan vehicle theyrolled him over to it and then moved clear there was a brief moan the whoosh ofpowerful vacuum and the small robot was sucked into the bowels of the sandcrawleras neatly as a pea up a straw this part of the job completed the jawas engaged inanother bout of jabbering following which they scurried into the crawler via tubesand ladders for all the world like a nest of mice returning to their holes 
 none too gently the suction tube deposited artoo in a small cubical inaddition to varied piles of broken instruments and outright scrap a dozen or so robotsof differing shapes and sizes populated the prison a few were locked in electronicconversation others muddled aimlessly about but when artoo tumbled into thechamber one voice burst out in surprise 
 artoo you you called an excited threepio from the neardarkness he made his way over to the still immobilized repair unit and embraced itmost unmechanically spotting the small disk sealed onto side threepioturned his gaze thoughtfully down to his own chest where a similar device hadlikewise been attached 
 massive gears poorly lubricated started to move with a groaning andgrinding the monster sandcrawler turned and lumbered with relentless patience intothe desert night

 the vicomte was a young man with soft features andpolished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but outof politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him upas a treat to her guests as a clever maitre serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seenit in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna servedup to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarlychoice morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussingthe murder of the duc the vicomte said that the had perished by his own magnanimity and that there wereparticular reasons for hatred of him 
 ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv inthe sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte 
 the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingnessto comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyoneto listen to his tale 
 the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to ofthe guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she toanother how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to athird and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style like a joint of roast beefon a hot dish 
 the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile 
 come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center ofanother group 
 the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile withwhich she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectlybeautiful woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmedwith moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair andsparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciouslyallowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure andshapely shoulders back and bosom which in the fashion of those dayswere very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of aballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was solovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but onthe contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all toovictorious beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminishits effect 
 how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte liftedhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by somethingextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him alsowith her unchanging smile 
 madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said inclining his head 
 the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table andconsidered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time thestory was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautifulround arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at herstill more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamondnecklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress andwhenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna atonce adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of and again relapsed into her radiant smile 
 the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene 
 wait a moment get my work now then what are you thinkingof she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag 
 there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself inher seat 
 now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her work 
 prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circleand moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her 
 le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinaryresemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact thatin spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his featureswere like his but while in her case everything was lit up bya joyous youthful and constant smile of by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on thecontrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression ofsullen while his body was thin and weak his and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions 
 not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak 
 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shoulders 
 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them 
 he spoke with such that his hearers could not besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he wasdressed in a dress coat knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings 
 the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote thencurrent to the effect that the duc had gone secretly toparis to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came uponbonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that inhis presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fitsto which he was subject and was thus at the mercy the latterspared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid bydeath 
 the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladieslooked agitated 
 charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess 
 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it 
 the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that hewas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried tothe rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout the balance of power and the latter evidently interested bythe young eagerness was explaining his pettheory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too was why anna pavlovna disapproved 
 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it wouldsave the world 
 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 
 at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely atpierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women 
 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i havehad the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to thinkof the climate said he 
 not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circle

 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shoulders 
 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them 
 he spoke with such that his hearers could not besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he wasdressed in a dress coat knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings 
 the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote thencurrent to the effect that the duc had gone secretly toparis to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came uponbonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that inhis presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fitsto which he was subject and was thus at the mercy the latterspared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid bydeath 
 the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladieslooked agitated 
 charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess 
 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it 
 the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that hewas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried tothe rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout the balance of power and the latter evidently interested bythe young eagerness was explaining his pettheory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too was why anna pavlovna disapproved 
 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it wouldsave the world 
 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 
 at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely atpierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women 
 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i havehad the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to thinkof the climate said he 
 not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circle

 chapter 
 
 while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly i asked the reason she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious 
 too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed the whole furniture consisted of a chair a and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff and everyone else 
 the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and earnshaw here and there varied to catherine heathcliff and again to catherine linton 
 in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a bore the inscription catherine earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a least the appearance of every morsel of blank that the printer had left some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend yet powerfully sketched an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics 
 an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath i wish my father were back again hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to heathcliff is and i are going to took our initiatory step this evening 
 all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable anything but reading their bibles answer for myself and the unhappy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake a vain idea the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers 
 you forget you have a master here says the tyrant demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence oh boy was that you frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the palaver that we should be ashamed of we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks 
 t maister nobbut just buried and sabbath nut und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye dahn ill childer good books eneugh if read em sit ye dahn and think uh yer sowls 
 saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us i could not bear the employment i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing i hated a good book heathcliff kicked his to the same place then there was a hubbub 
 maister hindley shouted our chaplain maister coom hither miss riven th back off th helmet uh salvation un pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh t brooad way to destruction fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait ech th owd man ud uh laced em goan 
 hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter a pleasant then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here 
 
 
 i suppose catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose 
 how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i give over poor heathcliff hindley calls him a vagabond and let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating h too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place 
 
 i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print i saw a red ornamented times seven and the first of the a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabes branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough and while i was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what jabes branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night i remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering 
 i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a cudgel which i understood to be so denominated for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence then a new idea flashed across me i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabes branderham preach from the times seven and either joseph the preacher or i had committed the first of the and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated 
 we came to the chapel i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets however in my dream jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously 
 oh how weary i grew how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done i was condemned hear all out finally he reached the first of the at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabes branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon 
 sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and is too much have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more 
 thou art the man cries jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy times seven did i take counsel with my this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the is come brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints 
 with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and every hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before 
 this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton come home lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced 
 heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up 
 it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare sorry i disturbed you 
 oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment 
 it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den 
 what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for sake repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut 
 if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabes branderham akin to you on the side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was must have been a little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions no doubt 
 scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of with name in the had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to truth is sir i passed the first part of the night i stopped was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or 
 what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence dare you under my mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage 
 i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night not three yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight 
 always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me 
 and for me too i replied walk in the yard till daylight and then be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself 
 delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the mounts sentinel there you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you come in two minutes 
 i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh more oh my darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light 
 there was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew 
 two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came 
 a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality 
 it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan 
 and you you broke out as i entered turning to his and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my you hear damnable jade 
 put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please 
 heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice 
 my landlord hallooed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights 
 my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment

 with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and every hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before 
 this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton come home lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced 
 heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up 
 it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare sorry i disturbed you 
 oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment 
 it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den 
 what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for sake repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut 
 if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabes branderham akin to you on the side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was must have been a little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions no doubt 
 scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of with name in the had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to truth is sir i passed the first part of the night i stopped was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or 
 what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence dare you under my mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage 
 i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night not three yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight 
 always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me 
 and for me too i replied walk in the yard till daylight and then be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself 
 delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the mounts sentinel there you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you come in two minutes 
 i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh more oh my darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light 
 there was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew 
 two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came 
 a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality 
 it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan 
 and you you broke out as i entered turning to his and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my you hear damnable jade 
 put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please 
 heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice 
 my landlord hallooed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights 
 my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment

 chapter three 
 
 jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs 
 here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old sofa by the sunny window this was favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news 
 such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight 
 mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear 
 the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we got anything else answered jo with her mouth full 
 if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait 
 sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i take any out 
 you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they as nice as like 
 mine are spoiled with lemonade and i get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress 
 you must have gloves or i go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you dance without them and if you i should be so mortified then stay still i care much for company dancing no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers 
 you ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she get you any more this winter you make them do 
 i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are all i can do no tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one you see 
 your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her 
 then go without i care what people say cried jo taking up her book 
 you may have it you may only stain it and do behave nicely put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you 
 worry about me be as prim ad i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story 
 so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble 
 on new eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs 
 ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed 
 the dampness drying replied jo 
 what a queer smell like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air 
 there now take off the papers and see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs 
 she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim 
 oh oh oh what have you done spoiled i go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead 
 just my luck you have asked me to do it i always spoil everything so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret 
 it spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly 
 serves me right for trying to be fine i wish let my hair alone cried meg petulantly 
 so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep 
 after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die 
 have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window 
 girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs 
 yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake 
 it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own 
 now forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs dressing room after a prolonged prink 
 i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush 
 no winking ladylike lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it the thing 
 how do you learn all the proper ways i never can that music gay 
 down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy 
 dear me i know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in 
 but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled mind me stay if you like 
 i disturb you 
 not a bit i only came here because i know many people and felt rather strange at first you know 
 so did i go away please unless rather 
 the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us you 
 next door and he looked up and laughed outright for prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home 
 that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present 
 grandpa sent it 
 but you put it into his head you now 
 how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun 
 nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march only jo returned the young lady 
 not mr laurence only laurie 
 laurie laurence what an odd name 
 my first name is theodore but i like it for the fellows called me dora so i made the say laurie instead 
 i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora 
 i thrashed em 
 i thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh 
 you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her 
 i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this sure to upset something tread on toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about you dance 
 sometimes you see been abroad a good many years and been into company enough yet to know how you do things here 
 abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels 
 laurie seem to know where to begin but eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers 
 i wish been there cried jo did you go to paris 
 we spent last winter there 
 can you talk french 
 we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay 
 do say some i can read it but pronounce 
 quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis 
 how nicely you do it let me said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers you 
 oui mademoiselle 
 my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty 
 yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady 
 jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances bashfulness soon wore off for gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them 
 curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is 
 it was on the tip of tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a way 
 i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her 
 laurie smiled but seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i go before seventeen anyway 
 you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already 
 sixteen next month 
 how i wish i was going to college you look as if you liked it 
 i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like 
 to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way 
 jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time a splendid polka why you go and try it 
 if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow 
 i for i told meg i because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh 
 because what 
 you tell 
 never 
 well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know 
 but laurie laugh he only looked dawn a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that tell you how we can manage a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come 
 jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale 
 sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i know how ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain 
 i knew hurt your feet with those silly shoes sorry but i see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke 
 i have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i get one at all for most people come in their own and a long way to the stable and no one to send 
 go 
 no indeed past nine and dark as egypt i stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can 
 ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her 
 mercy no ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she are going out to supper now stay with you rather 
 
 no dear run along and bring me some coffee so tired i stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back 
 oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing glove by scrubbing her gown with it 
 can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other 
 i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the glove 
 too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister 
 oh thank you show you where she is i offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did 
 jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or thre other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain 
 hush say anything she whispered adding aloud nothing i turned my foot a little all and limped upstairs to put her things on 
 hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till se decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his carriage which had just come for him he said 
 so early you mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer 
 i always go early i do truly please let me take you home all on my way you know and it rains they say 
 that settled it and telling him of mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom 
 i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable 
 yes till i hurt myself friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought 
 i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice 
 oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him 
 he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i help laughing did you hear us 
 no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there 
 jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out 
 tell about the party tell about the party 
 with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening 
 i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown wit a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair 
 i believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right
