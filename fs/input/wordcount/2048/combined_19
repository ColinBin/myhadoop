democratic national convention address 
 jesse jackson 
 the rainbow coalition 
 delivered july san francisco 
 thank you very much 
 tonight we come together bound by our faith in a mighty god with genuine respect and love for our country and inheriting the legacy of a great party the democratic party which is the best hope for redirecting our nation on a more humane just and peaceful course 
 this is not a perfect party we are not a perfect people yet we are called to a perfect mission our mission to feed the hungry to clothe the naked to house the homeless to teach the illiterate to provide jobs for the jobless and to choose the human race over the nuclear race 
 we are gathered here this week to nominate a candidate and adopt a platform which will expand unify direct and inspire our party and the nation to fulfill this mission my constituency is the desperate the damned the disinherited the disrespected and the despised they are restless and seek relief they have voted in record numbers they have invested the faith hope and trust that they have in us the democratic party must send them a signal that we care i pledge my best not to let them down 
 there is the call of conscience redemption expansion healing and unity leadership must heed the call of conscience redemption expansion healing and unity for they are the key to achieving our mission time is neutral and does not change things with courage and initiative leaders change things 
 no generation can choose the age or circumstance in which it is born but through leadership it can choose to make the age in which it is born an age of enlightenment an age of jobs and peace and justice only leadership that intangible combination of gifts the discipline information circumstance courage timing will and divine inspiration can lead us out of the crisis in which we find ourselves leadership can mitigate the misery of our nation leadership can part the waters and lead our nation in the direction of the promised land leadership can lift the boats stuck at the bottom 
 i have had the rare opportunity to watch seven men and then two pour out their souls offer their service and heal and heed the call of duty to direct the course of our nation there is a proper season for everything there is a time to sow and a time to reap a time to compete and a time to cooperate 
 i ask for your vote on the first ballot as a vote for a new direction for this party and this nation a vote of conviction a vote of conscience but i will be proud to support the nominee of this convention for the presidency of the united states of america thank you 
 i have watched the leadership of our party develop and grow my respect for both mr mondale and mr hart is great i have watched them struggle with the crosswinds and crossfires of being public servants and i believe they will both continue to try to serve us faithfully 
 i am elated by the knowledge that for the first time in our history a woman geraldine ferraro will be recommended to share our ticket 
 throughout this campaign tried to offer leadership to the democratic party and the nation if in my high moments i have done some good offered some service shed some light healed some wounds rekindled some hope or stirred someone from apathy and indifference or in any way along the way helped somebody then this campaign has not been in vain 
 for friends who loved and cared for me and for a god who spared me and for a family who understood i am eternally grateful 
 if in my low moments in word deed or attitude through some error of temper taste or tone i have caused anyone discomfort created pain or revived fears that was not my truest self if there were occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance please forgive me charge it to my head and not to my heart my head so limited in its finitude my heart which is boundless in its love for the human family i am not a perfect servant i am a public servant doing my best against the odds as i develop and serve be patient god is not finished with me yet 
 this campaign has taught me much that leaders must be tough enough to fight tender enough to cry human enough to make mistakes humble enough to admit them strong enough to absorb the pain and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving 
 for leaders the pain is often intense but you must smile through your tears and keep moving with the faith that there is a brighter side somewhere 
 i went to see hubert humphrey three days before he died he had just called richard nixon from his dying bed and many people wondered why and i asked him he said jesse from this vantage point the sun is setting in my life all of the speeches the political conventions the crowds and the great fights are behind me now at a time like this you are forced to deal with your irreducible essence forced to grapple with that which is really important to you and what concluded about life hubert humphrey said when all is said and done we must forgive each other and redeem each other and move on 
 our party is emerging from one of its most hard fought battles for the democratic presidential nomination in our history but our healthy competition should make us better not bitter we must use the insight wisdom and experience of the late hubert humphrey as a balm for the wounds in our party this nation and the world we must forgive each other redeem each other regroup and move one our flag is red white and blue but our nation is a rainbow red yellow brown black and white and all precious in sight 
 america is not like a blanket one piece of unbroken cloth the same color the same texture the same size america is more like a quilt many patches many pieces many colors many sizes all woven and held together by a common thread the white the hispanic the black the arab the jew the woman the native american the small farmer the businessperson the environmentalist the peace activist the young the old the lesbian the gay and the disabled make up the american quilt 
 even in our fractured state all of us count and fit somewhere we have proven that we can survive without each other but we have not proven that we can win and make progress without each other we must come together 
 from fannie lou hamer in atlantic city in to the rainbow coalition in san francisco today from the atlantic to the pacific we have experienced pain but progress as we ended american apartheid laws we got public accommodations we secured voting rights we obtained open housing as young people got the right to vote we lost malcolm martin medgar bobby john and viola the team that got us here must be expanded not abandoned 
 twenty years ago tears welled up in our eyes as the bodies of schwerner goodman and chaney were dredged from the depths of a river in mississippi twenty years later our communities black and jewish are in anguish anger and pain feelings have been hurt on both sides there is a crisis in communications confusion is in the air but we cannot afford to lose our way we may agree to agree or agree to disagree on issues we must bring back civility to these tensions 
 we are in a long and rich religious history the traditions many blacks and jews have a shared passion for social justice at home and peace abroad we must seek a revival of the spirit inspired by a new vision and new possibilities we must return to higher ground we are bound by moses and jesus but also connected with islam and mohammed these three great religions judaism christianity and islam were all born in the revered and holy city of jerusalem 
 we are bound by dr martin luther king jr and rabbi abraham heschel crying out from their graves for us to reach common ground we are bound by shared blood and shared sacrifices we are much too intelligent much too bound by our heritage much too victimized by racism sexism militarism and much too threatened as historical scapegoats to go on divided one from another we must turn from finger pointing to clasped hands we must share our burdens and our joys with each other once again we must turn to each other and not on each other and choose higher ground 
 twenty years later we cannot be satisfied by just restoring the old coalition old wine skins must make room for new wine we must heal and expand the rainbow coalition is making room for arab americans they too know the pain and hurt of racial and religious rejection they must not continue to be made pariahs the rainbow coalition is making room for hispanic americans who this very night are living under the threat of the bill and farm workers from ohio who are fighting the campbell soup company with a boycott to achieve legitimate workers rights 
 the rainbow is making room for the native american the most exploited people of all a people with the greatest moral claim amongst us we support them as they seek the restoration of their ancient land and claim amongst us we support them as they seek the restoration of land and water rights as they seek to preserve their ancestral homeland and the beauty of a land that was once all theirs they can never receive a fair share for all they have given us they must finally have a fair chance to develop their great resources and to preserve their people and their culture 
 the rainbow coalition includes asian americans now being killed in our streets scapegoats for the failures of corporate industrial and economic policies 
 the rainbow is making room for the young americans twenty years ago our young people were dying in a war for which they could not even vote twenty years later young america has the power to stop a war in central america and the responsibility to vote in great numbers young america must be politically active in the choice is war or peace we must make room for young america 
 the rainbow includes disabled veterans the color scheme fits in the rainbow the disabled have their handicap revealed and their genius concealed while the have their genius revealed and their disability concealed but ultimately we must judge people by their values and their contribution leave anybody out i would rather have roosevelt in a wheelchair than reagan on a horse 
 the rainbow is making room for small farmers they have suffered tremendously under the reagan regime they will either receive percent parity or percent charity we must address their concerns and make room for them the rainbow includes lesbians and gays no american citizen ought be denied equal protection from the law 
 we must be unusually committed and caring as we expand our family to include new members all of us must be tolerant and understanding as the fears and anxieties of the rejected and the party leadership express themselves in many different ways too often what we call hate as if it were some philosophy or strategy is simply ignorance anxiety paranoia fear and insecurity to be strong leaders we must be as we seek to right the wrongs of our party and our nation we must expand our party heal our party and unify our party that is our mission in 
 we are often reminded that we live in a great nation and we do but it can be greater still the rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness we must not measure greatness from the mansion down but the manger up jesus said that we should not be judged by the bark we wear but by the fruit that we bear jesus said that we must measure greatness by how we treat the least of these 
 president reagan says the nation is in recovery those corporations that made a profit last year but paid no federal taxes are recovering the military contractors who have benefited from more than doubling of the military budget in peacetime surely they are recovering the big corporations and rich individuals who received the bulk of a multibillion tax cut from mr reagan are recovering but no such recovery is under way for the least of these 
 rising tides lift all boats particularly those stuck at the bottom for the boats stuck at the bottom a misery index this administration has made life more miserable for the poor its attitude has been contemptuous its policies and programs have been cruel and unfair to working people they must be held accountable in november for increasing infant mortality among the poor in detroit one of the great cities of the western world babies are dying at the same rate as honduras the most underdeveloped nation in our hemisphere this administration must be held accountable for policies that have contributed to the growing poverty in america there are now million people in poverty percent of our nation million are white million black hispanic asian and others mostly women and children by the end of this year there will be million people in poverty we cannot stand idly by we must fight for a change now 
 under this regime we look at social security the budget cuts included nine permanent social security benefit cuts totaling billion over five years small businesses have suffered under reagan tax cuts only percent of total business tax cuts went to them percent to big businesses health care under mr reagan has already been sharply cut education under mr reagan has been cut percent under mr reagan there are now million female head families they represent percent of all families half of all of them are poor percent of all poor children live in a house headed by a woman where there is no man under mr reagan the administration has cleaned up only of priority toxic waste dumps farmers real net income was only about half its level in 
 many say that the race in november will be decided in the south president reagan is depending on the conservative south to return him to office but the south i tell you is unnaturally conservative the south is the poorest region in our nation and therefore has the least to conserve in his appeal to the south mr reagan is trying to substitute flags and prayer cloths for food and clothing and education health care and housing 
 mr reagan will ask us to pray and i believe in prayer i have come to this way by the power of prayer but then we must watch false prophecy he cuts energy assistance to the poor cuts breakfast programs from children cuts lunch programs from children cuts job training from children and then says to an empty table let us pray apparently he is not familiar with the structure of a prayer you thank the lord for the food that you are about to receive not the food that just left i think that we should pray but pray for the food that left pray for the man that took the food to leave we need a change we need a change in november 
 under mr reagan the misery index has risen for the poor the danger index has risen for everybody under this administration lost the lives of our boys in central america and honduras in grenada in lebanon in nuclear standoff in europe under this administration of our children believe they will die in a nuclear war the danger index is increasing in this world all the talk about the defense against russia the russian submarines are closer and their missiles are more accurate we live in a world tonight more miserable and a world more dangerous 
 while reaganomics and reaganism is talked about often so often we miss the real meaning reaganism is a spirit and reaganomics represents the real economic facts of life in mr george bush a man with reasonable access to mr reagan did an analysis of mr economic plan mr george bush concluded that plan was voodoo economics he was right candidate john anderson said a combination of military spending tax cuts and a balanced budget by would be accomplished with blue smoke and mirrors they were both right 
 mr reagan talks about a dynamic recovery some measure of recovery three and a half years later unemployment has inched just below where it was when he took office in there are still million people officially unemployed million working only inflation has come down but analyze for a moment who has paid the price for this superficial economic recovery 
 mr reagan curbed inflation by cutting consumer demand he cut consumer demand with conscious and callous fiscal and monetary policies he used the federal budget to deliberately induce unemployment and curb social spending he then weighed and supported tight monetary policies of the federal reserve board to deliberately drive up interest rates again to curb consumer demand created through borrowing unemployment reached percent we experienced skyrocketing interest rates our dollar inflated abroad there were record bank failures record farm foreclosures record business bankruptcies record budget deficits record trade deficits 
 mr reagan brought inflation down by destabilizing our economy and disrupting family life he promised he promised in a balanced budget but instead we now have a record billion dollar budget deficit under mr reagan the cumulative budget deficit for his four years is more than the sum total of deficits from george washington to jimmy carter combined i tell you we need a change 
 how is he paying for these jobs economic recovery is being financed by deficit spending billion dollars a year military spending a major cause of this deficit is projected over the next five years to be nearly trillion dollars and will cost about dollars for every taxpaying family when the government borrows billion dollars annually to finance the deficit this encourages the private sector to make its money off of interest rates as opposed to development and economic growth 
 even money abroad we have enough money domestically to finance the debt so we are now borrowing money abroad from foreign banks governments and financial institutions billion dollars in billion dollars in percent of our total over billion dollars percent of our total in by it is projected that percent of all individual income taxes will be going just to pay for interest on that debt the united states used to be the largest exporter of capital but under mr reagan we will quite likely become the largest debtor nation 
 about two weeks ago on july the th we celebrated our declaration of independence yet every day economics is making our nation more economically dependent and less economically free five to six percent of our gross national product is now being eaten up with president budget deficits to depend on foreign military powers to protect our national security would be foolish making us dependent and less secure yet reaganomics has us increasingly dependent on foreign economic sources this but recovery is unbalanced and artificial we have a challenge as democrats to point a way out 
 democracy guarantees opportunity not success 
 democracy guarantees the right to participate not a license for either a majority or a minority to dominate 
 the victory for the rainbow coalition in the platform debates today was not whether we won or lost but that we raised the right issues we could afford to lose the vote issues are we could not afford to avoid raising the right questions our and our moral integrity were at stake our heads are perhaps bloody but not bowed our back is straight we can go home and face our people our vision is clear 
 when we think on this journey from to championship that we have gone from the planks of the boardwalk in atlantic city in to fighting to help write the planks in the platform in san francisco in there is a deep and abiding sense of joy in our souls in spite of the tears in our eyes though there are missing planks there is a solid foundation upon which to build our party can win but we must provide hope which will inspire people to struggle and achieve provide a plan that shows a way out of our dilemma and then lead the way 
 in my heart is made to feel glad because i know there is a way out justice the requirement for rebuilding america is justice the linchpin of progressive politics in our nation will not come from the north they in fact will come from the south that is why i argue over and over again we look from virginia around to texas only one black congressperson out of nineteen years later locked out of the congress the senate and the mansion what does this large black vote mean why do i fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and elections why do we fight over that because i tell you you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them unless you linger there 
 if you want a change in this nation you enforce that voting rights act get to black hispanics female and progressive congresspersons from the south we can save the cotton but got to fight the boll weevils got to make a judgment got to make a judgment 
 it is not enough to hope era will pass how can we pass era if blacks vote in great numbers progressive whites win the only way progressive whites win if blacks vote in great numbers hispanics win when blacks hispanics and progressive whites vote women win when women win children win when women and children win workers win we must all come up together we must come up together 
 thank you 
 for all of our joy and excitement we must not save the world and lose our souls we should never enforcing the voting rights act at every level when one of us all of us will rise justice is the way out peace is the way out we should not act as if nuclear weaponry is negotiable and debatable 
 in this world in which we live we dropped the bomb on japan and felt guilty but in other folks have also got bombs this time if we drop the bomb six minutes later we too will be destroyed not about dropping the bomb on somebody it is about dropping the bomb on everybody we must choose to develop minds over guided missiles and think it out and not fight it out time for a change 
 our foreign policy must be characterized by mutual respect not by gunboat diplomacy big stick diplomacy and threats our nation at its best feeds the hungry our nation at its worst at its worst will mine the harbors of nicaragua at its worst will try to overthrow their government at its worst will cut aid to american education and increase the aid to el salvador at its worst our nation will have partnerships with south africa a moral disgrace a moral disgrace a moral disgrace 
 we look at africa we cannot just focus on apartheid in southern africa we must fight for trade with africa and not just aid to africa we cannot stand idly by and say we will not relate to nicaragua unless they have elections there and then embrace military regimes in africa overthrowing democratic governments in nigeria and liberia and ghana we must fight for democracy all around the world and play the game by one set of rules 
 peace in this world our present formula for peace in the middle east is inadequate it will not work there are nations in the middle east our nation must be able to talk and act and influence all of them we must build upon camp david and measure human rights by one yard stick in that region we have too many interests and too few friends 
 there is a way out jobs put america back to work when i was a child growing up in greenville south carolina the reverend sample used to preach every so often a sermon relating to jesus and he said if i be lifted up draw all men unto me i quite understand what he meant as a child growing up but i understand a little better now if you raise up truth magnetic it has a way of drawing people 
 with all this confusion in this convention the bright lights and parties and big fun we must raise up the simple proposition if we lift up a program to feed the hungry come running if we lift up a program to study war no more our youth will come running if we lift up a program to put america back to work and an alternative to welfare and despair they will come working 
 if we cut that military budget without cutting our defense and use that money to rebuild bridges and put steel workers back to work and use that money and provide jobs for our cities and use that money to build schools and pay teachers and educate our children and build hospitals and train doctors and train nurses the whole nation will come running to us 
 as i leave you now we vote in this convention and get ready to go back across this nation in a couple of days in this campaign tried to be faithful to my promise i lived in old barrios ghettos and reservations and housing projects i have a message for our youth i challenge them to put hope in their brains and not dope in their veins i told them that like jesus i too was born in the slum but just because born in the slum does not mean the slum is born in you and you can rise above it if your mind is made up i told them in every slum there are two sides when i see a broken window the slummy side train some youth to become a glazier the sunny side when i see a missing brick the slummy side let that child in the union and become a brick mason and build the sunny side when i see a missing door the slummy side train some youth to become a carpenter the sunny side and when i see the vulgar words and hieroglyphics of destitution on the walls the slummy side train some youth to become a painter an artist the sunny side 
 we leave this place looking for the sunny side because a brighter side somewhere more convinced than ever that we can win we will vault up the rough side of the mountain we can win i just want young america to do me one favor just one favor exercise the right to dream you must face reality that which is but then dream of a reality that ought to be that must be live beyond the pain of reality with the dream of a bright tomorrow use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress use love to motivate you and obligate you to serve the human family 
 young america dream choose the human race over the nuclear race bury the weapons and burn the people dream dream of a new value system teachers who teach for life and not just for a living teach because they help it dream of lawyers more concerned about justice than a judgeship dream of doctors more concerned about public health than personal wealth dream of preachers and priests who will prophesy and not just profiteer preach and dream 
 our time has come our time has come suffering breeds character character breeds faith in the end faith will not disappoint our time has come our faith hope and dreams will prevail our time has come weeping has endured for nights but now joy cometh in the morning our time has come no grave can hold our body down our time has come no lie can live forever our time has come we must leave racial battle ground and come to economic common ground and moral higher ground america our time has come we come from disgrace to amazing grace our time has come give me your tired give me your poor your huddled masses who yearn to breathe free and come november there will be a change because our time has come 
 
 statement on the articles of impeachment 
 barbara jordan 
 delivered july house judiciary committee 
 mr chairman i join my colleague mr rangel in thanking you for giving the junior members of this committee the glorious opportunity of sharing the pain of this inquiry mr chairman you are a strong man and it has not been easy but we have tried as best we can to give you as much assistance as possible 
 earlier today we heard the beginning of the preamble to the constitution of the united states we the people a very eloquent beginning but when that document was completed on the seventeenth of september in i was not included in that we the people i felt somehow for many years that george washington and alexander hamilton just left me out by mistake but through the process of amendment interpretation and court decision i have finally been included in we the people 
 today i am an inquisitor an hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that i feel right now my faith in the constitution is whole it is complete it is total and i am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution the subversion the destruction of the constitution 
 who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves federalist no the subject of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men that is what we are talking about in other words the jurisdiction comes from the abuse of violation of some public trust it is wrong i suggest it is a misreading of the constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be convinced that the president should be removed from office the constitution say that the powers relating to impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body of the legislature against and upon the encroachments of the executive the division between the two branches of the legislature the house and the senate assigning to the one the right to accuse and to the other the right to judge the framers of this constitution were very astute they did not make the accusers and the judges the same person 
 we know the nature of impeachment we have been talking about it awhile now it is chiefly designed for the president and his high ministers to somehow be called into account it is designed to bridle the executive if he engages in excesses it is designed as a method of national inquest into the public men the framers confined in the congress the power if need be to remove the president in order to strike a delicate balance between a president swollen with power and grown tyrannical and preservation of the independence of the executive the nature of impeachment is a narrowly channeled exception to the maxim the federal convention of said that 
 the framers limited impeachment to high crimes and misdemeanors and discounted and opposed the term maladministration it is to be used only for great misdemeanors so it was said in the north carolina ratification convention and in the virginia ratification convention we do not trust our liberty to a particular branch we need one branch to check the others 
 the north carolina ratification convention no one need be afraid that officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity prosecutions of impeachments will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community said hamilton in the federalist papers no and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused i do not mean political parties in that sense 
 the drawing of political lines goes to the motivation behind impeachment but impeachment must proceed within the confines of the constitutional term high crimes and misdemeanors of the impeachment process it was woodrow wilson who said that nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give them speed and effectiveness indignation so great as to overgrow party interest may secure a conviction but nothing else can 
 common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this process for petty reasons congress has a lot to do appropriation tax reform health insurance campaign finance reform housing environmental protection energy sufficiency mass transportation pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems so today we are not being petty we are trying to be big because the task we have before us is a big one 
 this morning in a discussion of the evidence we were told that the evidence which purports to support the allegations of misuse of the cia by the president is thin we are told that that evidence is insufficient what that recital of the evidence this morning did not include is what the president did know on june the rd 
 the president did know that it was republican money that it was money from the committee for the of the president which was found in the possession of one of the burglars arrested on june the th what the president did know on the rd of june was the prior activities of e howard hunt which included his participation in the of daniel psychiatrist which included howard participation in the dita beard itt affair which included howard fabrication of cables designed to discredit the kennedy administration 
 we were further cautioned today that perhaps these proceedings ought to be delayed because certainly there would be new evidence forthcoming from the president of the united states there has not even been an obfuscated indication that this committee would receive any additional materials from the president the committee subpoena is outstanding and if the president wants to supply that material the committee sits here the fact is that on yesterday the american people waited with great anxiety for eight hours not knowing whether their president would obey an order of the supreme court of the united states 
 at this point i would like to juxtapose a few of the impeachment criteria with some of actions the president has engaged in impeachment criteria james madison from the virginia ratification convention if the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter him he may be impeached 
 we have heard time and time again that the evidence reflects the payment to defendants of money the president had knowledge that these funds were being paid and these were funds collected for the presidential campaign we know that the president met with mr henry petersen times to discuss matters related to watergate and immediately thereafter met with the very persons who were implicated in the information mr petersen was receiving and transmitting to the president the words are if the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter that person he may be impeached 
 justice story impeachment is intended for occasional and extraordinary cases where a superior power acting for the whole people is put into operation to protect their rights and rescue their liberties from violations 
 we know about the huston plan we know about the of the office we know that there was absolute complete direction in august when the president instructed ehrlichman to do whatever is necessary this instruction led to a surreptitious entry into dr office 
 protect their rights rescue their liberties from violation 
 the south carolina ratification convention impeachment criteria those are impeachable who behave amiss or betray their public trust 
 beginning shortly after the watergate and continuing to the present time the president has engaged in a series of public statements and actions designed to thwart the lawful investigation by government prosecutors moreover the president has made public announcements and assertions bearing on the watergate case which the evidence will show he knew to be false these assertions false assertions impeachable those who misbehave those who behave amiss or betray their public trust 
 james madison again at the constitutional convention a president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the constitution 
 the constitution charges the president with the task of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed and yet the president has counseled his aides to commit perjury willfully disregarded the secrecy of grand jury proceedings concealed surreptitious entry attempted to compromise a federal judge while publicly displaying his cooperation with the processes of criminal justice 
 a president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the constitution 
 if the impeachment provision in the constitution of the united states will not reach the offenses charged here then perhaps that th century constitution should be abandoned to a th century paper shredder 
 has the president committed offenses and planned and directed and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the constitution will not tolerate the question we know that we know the question we should now forthwith proceed to answer the question it is reason and not passion which must guide our deliberations guide our debate and guide our decision 
 
 farewell address to congress 
 general douglas macarthur 
 delivered april 
 mr president mr speaker and distinguished members of the congress 
 i stand on this rostrum with a sense of deep humility and great pride humility in the weight of those great american architects of our history who have stood here before me pride in the reflection that this home of legislative debate represents human liberty in the purest form yet devised here are centered the hopes and aspirations and faith of the entire human race i do not stand here as advocate for any partisan cause for the issues are fundamental and reach quite beyond the realm of partisan consideration they must be resolved on the highest plane of national interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected i trust therefore that you will do me the justice of receiving that which i have to say as solely expressing the considered viewpoint of a fellow american 
 i address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of life with but one purpose in mind to serve my country the issues are global and so interlocked that to consider the problems of one sector oblivious to those of another is but to court disaster for the whole while asia is commonly referred to as the gateway to europe it is no less true that europe is the gateway to asia and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other there are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts that we cannot divide our effort i can think of no greater expression of defeatism if a potential enemy can divide his strength on two fronts it is for us to counter his effort the communist threat is a global one its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction of every other sector you can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism in asia without simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance in europe 
 beyond pointing out these general truisms i shall confine my discussion to the general areas of asia before one may objectively assess the situation now existing there he must comprehend something of past and the revolutionary changes which have marked her course up to the present long exploited by the colonial powers with little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice individual dignity or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the philippines the peoples of asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity a heretofore unfelt dignity and the of political freedom 
 mustering half of the population and percent of its natural resources these peoples are rapidly consolidating a new force both moral and material with which to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural environments whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not this is the direction of asian progress and it may not be stopped it is a corollary to the shift of the world economic frontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the area whence it started 
 in this situation it becomes vital that our own country orient its policies in consonance with this basic evolutionary condition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the colonial era is now past and the asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny what they seek now is friendly guidance understanding and support not imperious direction the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation their standard of life pitifully low is infinitely lower now in the devastation left in wake world ideologies play little part in asian thinking and are little understood what the peoples strive for is the opportunity for a little more food in their stomachs a little better clothing on their backs a little firmer roof over their heads and the realization of the normal nationalist urge for political freedom these conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism 
 of more direct and immediately bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the pacific ocean in the course of the past war prior thereto the western strategic frontier of the united states lay on the literal line of the americas with an exposed island salient extending out through hawaii midway and guam to the philippines that salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack 
 the pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas all this was changed by our pacific victory our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the entire pacific ocean which became a vast moat to protect us as long as we held it indeed it acts as a protective shield for all of the americas and all free lands of the pacific ocean area we control it to the shores of asia by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the aleutians to the mariannas held by us and our free allies from this island chain we can dominate with sea and air power every asiatic port from vladivostok to singapore with sea and air power every port as i said from vladivostok to singapore and prevent any hostile movement into the pacific 
 any predatory attack from asia must be an amphibious effort no amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance with naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases any major attack from continental asia toward us or our friends in the pacific would be doomed to failure 
 under such conditions the pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader it assumes instead the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake our line of defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense it envisions no attack against anyone nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations but properly maintained would be an invincible defense against aggression the holding of this literal defense line in the western pacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment 
 this is a military estimate as to which i have yet to find a military leader who will take exception for that reason i have strongly recommended in the past as a matter of military urgency that under no circumstances must formosa fall under communist control such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the philippines and the loss of japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of california oregon and washington 
 to understand the changes which now appear upon the chinese mainland one must understand the changes in chinese character and culture over the past years china up to years ago was completely being compartmented into groups divided against each other the tendency was almost as they still followed the tenets of the confucian ideal of pacifist culture at the turn of the century under the regime of chang tso lin efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a nationalist urge this was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of chiang but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant aggressive tendencies 
 through these past years the chinese people have thus become militarized in their concepts and in their ideals they now constitute excellent soldiers with competent staffs and commanders this has produced a new and dominant power in asia which for its own purposes is allied with soviet russia but which in its own concepts and methods has become aggressively imperialistic with a lust for expansion and increased power normal to this type of imperialism 
 there is little of the ideological concept either one way or another in the chinese the standard of living is so low and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly dissipated by war that the masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which seems to promise the alleviation of local stringencies 
 i have from the beginning believed that the chinese communists support of the north koreans was the dominant one their interests are at present parallel with those of the soviet but i believe that the aggressiveness recently displayed not only in korea but also in and tibet and pointing potentially toward the south reflects predominantly the same lust for the expansion of power which has animated every conqueror since the beginning of time 
 the japanese people since the war have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history with a commendable will eagerness to learn and marked capacity to understand they have from the ashes left in wake erected in japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality freedom of economic enterprise and social justice 
 politically economically and socially japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust that it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly beneficial influence over the course of events in asia is attested by the magnificent manner in which the japanese people have met the recent challenge of war confusion surrounding them from the outside and checked communism within their own frontiers without the slightest slackening in their forward progress i sent all four of our occupation divisions to the korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon japan the results fully justified my faith i know of no nation more serene orderly and industrious nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race 
 of our former ward the philippines we can look forward in confidence that the existing unrest will be corrected and a strong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of terrible destructiveness we must be patient and understanding and never fail them as in our hour of need they did not fail us a christian nation the philippines stand as a mighty bulwark of christianity in the far east and its capacity for high moral leadership in asia is unlimited 
 on formosa the government of the republic of china has had the opportunity to refute by action much of the malicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on the chinese mainland the formosan people are receiving a just and enlightened administration with majority representation on the organs of government and politically economically and socially they appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines 
 with this brief insight into the surrounding areas i now turn to the korean conflict while i was not consulted prior to the decision to intervene in support of the republic of korea that decision from a military standpoint proved a sound one as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces our victory was complete and our objectives within reach when red china intervened with numerically superior ground forces 
 this created a new war and an entirely new situation a situation not contemplated when our forces were committed against the north korean invaders a situation which called for new decisions in the diplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of military strategy 
 such decisions have not been forthcoming 
 while no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental china and such was never given a thought the new situation did urgently demand a drastic revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had defeated the old 
 apart from the military need as i saw it to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the enemy north of the yalu i felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made necessary first the intensification of our economic blockade against china two the imposition of a naval blockade against the china coast three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of coastal areas and of manchuria four removal of restrictions on the forces of the republic of china on formosa with logistical support to contribute to their effective operations against the common enemy 
 for entertaining these views all professionally designed to support our forces committed to korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless american and allied lives i have been severely criticized in lay circles principally abroad despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully shared in the past by practically every military leader concerned with the korean campaign including our own joint chiefs of staff 
 i called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available i made clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy bases north of the yalu if not permitted to utilize the friendly chinese force of some men on formosa if not permitted to blockade the china coast to prevent the chinese reds from getting succor from without and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements the position of the command from the military standpoint forbade victory 
 we could hold in korea by constant maneuver and in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy but we could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential i have constantly called for the new political decisions essential to a solution 
 efforts have been made to distort my position it has been said in effect that i was a warmonger nothing could be further from the truth i know war as few other men now living know it and nothing to me is more revolting i have long advocated its complete abolition as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes indeed on the second day of september nineteen hundred and just following the surrender of the japanese nation on the battleship missouri i formally cautioned as follows 
 men since the beginning of time have sought peace various methods through the ages have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations from the very start workable methods were found in so far as individual citizens were concerned but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger international scope have never been successful military alliances balances of power leagues of nations all in turn failed leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war the utter destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative we have had our last chance if we will not devise some greater and more equitable system armageddon will be at our door the problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronize with our almost matchless advances in science art literature and all material and cultural developments of the past years it must be of the spirit 
 if we are to save the flesh 
 but once war is forced upon us there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end 
 very object is victory not prolonged indecision 
 in war there is no substitute for victory 
 there are some who for varying reasons would appease red china they are blind to clear lesson for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war it points to no single instance where this end has justified that means where appeasement has led to more than a sham peace like blackmail it lays the basis for new and successively greater demands until as in blackmail violence becomes the only other alternative 
 why my soldiers asked of me surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field i could not answer 
 some may say to avoid spread of the conflict into an war with china others to avoid soviet intervention neither explanation seems valid for china is already engaging with the maximum power it can commit and the soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our moves like a cobra any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that the relativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a basis 
 the tragedy of korea is further heightened by the fact that its military action is confined to its territorial limits it condemns that nation which it is our purpose to save to suffer the devastating impact of full naval and air bombardment while the sanctuaries are fully protected from such attack and devastation 
 of the nations of the world korea alone up to now is the sole one which has risked its all against communism the magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the korean people defies description 
 they have chosen to risk death rather than slavery their last words to me were scuttle the pacific 
 i have just left your fighting sons in korea they have met all tests there and i can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way 
 it was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life its growing bloodshed has caused me the deepest anguish and anxiety 
 those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always 
 i am closing my years of military service when i joined the army even before the turn of the century it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams the world has turned over many times since i took the oath on the plain at west point and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished but i still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die they just fade away 
 and like the old soldier of that ballad i now close my military career and just fade away an old soldier who tried to do his duty as god gave him the light to see that duty 
 good bye 
 
 been to the mountaintop 
 martin luther king jr 
 delivered april in memphis tennessee 
 thank you very kindly my friends as i listened to ralph abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself i wondered who he was talking about always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you and ralph abernathy is the best friend that i have in the world delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of a storm warning you reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow 
 something is happening in memphis something is happening in our world and you know if i were standing at the beginning of time with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now and the almighty said to me martin luther king which age would you like to live in i would take my mental flight by egypt and i would watch children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of egypt through or rather across the red sea through the wilderness on toward the promised land and in spite of its magnificence i stop there 
 i would move on by greece and take my mind to mount olympus and i would see plato aristotle socrates euripides and aristophanes assembled around the parthenon and i would watch them around the parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality but i stop there 
 i would go on even to the great heyday of the roman empire and i would see developments around there through various emperors and leaders but i stop there i would even come up to the day of the renaissance and get a quick picture of all that the renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man but i stop there i would even go by the way that the man for whom named had his habitat and i would watch martin luther as he tacked his theses on the door at the church in wittenberg but i stop there 
 i would come on up even to and watch a vacillating president by the name of abraham lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the emancipation proclamation but i stop there 
 i would even come up to the early thirties and see a man grappling with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation and come with an eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but fear itself but i stop there 
 strangely enough i would turn to the almighty and say if you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the th century i will be happy 
 now a strange statement to make because the world is all messed up the nation is sick trouble is in the land confusion all around a strange statement but i know somehow that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars and i see god working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men in some strange way are responding something is happening in our world 
 the masses of people are rising up and wherever they are assembled today whether they are in johannesburg south africa nairobi kenya accra ghana new york city atlanta georgia jackson mississippi or memphis tennessee the cry is always the same we want to be free 
 and another reason that happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history but the demands force them to do it survival demands that we grapple with them men for years now have been talking about war and peace but now no longer can they just talk about it it is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world nonviolence or nonexistence that is where we are today 
 and also in the human rights revolution if something done and done in a hurry to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty their long years of hurt and neglect the whole world is doomed now just happy that god has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding and happy that allowed me to be in memphis 
 i can remember i can remember when negroes were just going around as ralph has said so often scratching where they itch and laughing when they were not tickled but that day is all over we mean business now and we are determined to gain our rightful place in world 
 and all this whole thing is about we engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody we are saying that we are determined to be men we are determined to be people we are saying that we are children and that we have to live like we are forced to live 
 now what does all of this mean in this great period of history it means that got to stay together got to stay together and maintain unity you know whenever pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in egypt he had a favorite favorite formula for doing it what was that he kept the slaves fighting among themselves but whenever the slaves get together something happens in court and he cannot hold the slaves in slavery when the slaves get together the beginning of getting out of slavery now let us maintain unity 
 secondly let us keep the issues where they are the issue is injustice the issue is the refusal of memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants who happen to be sanitation workers now got to keep attention on that always the problem with a little violence you know what happened the other day and the press dealt only with the i read the articles they very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand three hundred sanitation workers were on strike and that memphis is not being fair to them and that mayor loeb is in dire need of a doctor they get around to that 
 now going to march again and got to march again in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be and force everybody to see that there are thirteen hundred of children here suffering sometimes going hungry going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out the issue and got to say to the nation we know coming out for when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it there is no stopping point short of victory 
 we going to let any mace stop us we are masters in our nonviolent movement in disarming police forces they know what to do seen them so often i remember in birmingham alabama when we were in that majestic struggle there we would move out of the th street baptist church day after day by the hundreds we would move out and bull connor would tell them to send the dogs forth and they did come but we just went before the dogs singing gonna let nobody turn me around bull connor next would say turn the fire hoses on and as i said to you the other night bull connor know history he knew a kind of physics that somehow relate to the transphysics that we knew about and that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out and we went before the fire hoses we had known water if we were baptist or some other denomination we had been immersed if we were methodist and some others we had been sprinkled but we knew water 
 that stop us and we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them and go on before the water hoses and we would look at it and just go on singing over my head i see freedom in the air and then we would be thrown in the paddy wagons and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can and they would throw us in and old bull would say take them off and they did and we would just go in the paddy wagon singing we shall overcome and every now and then get in the jail and see the jailers looking through the windows being moved by our prayers and being moved by our words and our songs and there was a power there which bull connor adjust to and so we ended up transforming bull into a steer and we won our struggle in birmingham 
 now got to go on to memphis just like that i call upon you to be with us monday now about injunctions we have an injunction and going into court tomorrow morning to fight this illegal unconstitutional injunction all we say to america is be true to what you said on paper if i lived in china or even russia or any totalitarian country maybe i could understand the denial of certain basic first amendment privileges because they committed themselves to that over there but somewhere i read of the freedom of assembly somewhere i read of the freedom of speech somewhere i read of the freedom of the press somewhere i read that the greatness of america is the right to protest for right and so just as i say we going to let any injunction turn us around we are going on 
 we need all of you and you know beautiful tome is to see all of these ministers of the gospel a marvelous picture who is it that is supposed to articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher somehow the preacher must be an amos and say let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream somehow the preacher must say with jesus the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor 
 and i want to commend the preachers under the leadership of these noble men james lawson one who has been in this struggle for many years been to jail for struggling but still going on fighting for the rights of his people rev ralph jackson billy kiles i could just go right on down the list but time will not permit but i want to thank them all and i want you to thank them because so often preachers concerned about anything but themselves and always happy to see a relevant ministry 
 all right to talk about long white robes over yonder in all of its symbolism but ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here all right to talk about streets flowing with milk and honey but god has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here and his children who eat three square meals a day all right to talk about the new jerusalem but one day preachers must talk about the new york the new atlanta the new philadelphia the new los angeles the new memphis tennessee this is what we have to do 
 now the other thing have to do is this always anchor our external direct action with the power of economic withdrawal now we are poor people individually we are poor when you compare us with white society in america we are poor never stop and forget that collectively that means all of us together collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world with the exception of nine did you ever think about that after you leave the united states soviet russia great britain west germany france and i could name the others the negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world we have an annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year which is more than all of the exports of the united states and more than the national budget of canada did you know that power right there if we know how to pool it 
 we have to argue with anybody we have to curse and go around acting bad with our words we need any bricks and bottles we need any molotov cocktails we just need to go around to these stores and to these massive industries in our country and say god sent us by here to say to you that not treating his children right and come by here to ask you to make the first item on your agenda fair treatment where children are concerned now if you are not prepared to do that we do have an agenda that we must follow and our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you 
 and so as a result of this we are asking you tonight to go out and tell your neighbors not to buy in memphis go by and tell them not to buy sealtest milk tell them not to buy what is the other bread wonder bread and what is the other bread company jesse tell them not to buy bread as jesse jackson has said up to now only the garbage men have been feeling pain now we must kind of redistribute the pain we are choosing these companies because they been fair in their hiring policies and we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike and then they can move on downtown and tell mayor loeb to do what is right 
 but not only that got to strengthen black institutions i call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in bank we want a movement in memphis so go by the savings and loan association not asking you something we do ourselves at sclc judge hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings and loan association from the southern christian leadership conference just telling you to follow what doing put your money there you have six or seven black insurance companies in memphis take out your insurance there we want to have an 
 now these are some practical things we can do we begin the process of building a greater economic base and at the same time we are putting pressure where it really hurts i ask you to follow through here 
 now let me say as i move to my conclusion that got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in memphis got to see it through and when we have our march you need to be there be concerned about your brother you may not be on strike but either we go up together or we go down together 
 let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness one day a man came to jesus and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters in life at points he wanted to trick jesus and show him that he knew a little more than jesus knew and through this throw him off base now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate but jesus immediately pulled that question from and placed it on a dangerous curve between jerusalem and jericho and he talked about a certain man who fell among thieves you remember that a levite and a priest passed by on the other side they stop to help him and finally a man of another race came by he got down from his beast decided not to be compassionate by proxy but with him administering first aid and helped the man in need jesus ended up saying this was the good man this was the great man because he had the capacity to project the i into the thou and to be concerned about his brother now you know we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the levite stop at times we say they were busy going to church meetings an ecclesiastical gathering and they had to get on down to jerusalem so they be late for their meeting at other times we would speculate that there was a religious law that one who was engaged in religious ceremonials was not to touch a human body hours before the ceremony and every now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to jerusalem or down to jericho rather to organize a jericho road improvement association a possibility maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root rather than to get bogged down with an individual effort 
 but going to tell you what my imagination tells me possible that these men were afraid you see the jericho road is a dangerous road 
 i remember when mrs king and i were first in jerusalem we rented a car and drove from jerusalem down to jericho and as soon as we got on that road i said to my wife i can see why jesus used this as a setting for his parable a winding meandering road really conducive for ambushing you start out in jerusalem which is about miles or rather feet above sea level and by the time you get down to jericho fifteen or twenty minutes later about feet below sea level a dangerous road in the days of jesus it came to be known as the bloody pass and you know possible that the priest and the levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around or possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking and he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt in order to seize them over there lure them there for quick and easy seizure and so the first question that the priest asked the first question that the levite asked was if i stop to help this man what will happen to me but then the good samaritan came by and he reversed the question if i do not stop to help this man what will happen to him 
 the question before you tonight not if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to my job not if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that i usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor the question is not if i stop to help this man in need what will happen to me the question is if i do not stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to them the question 
 let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness let us stand with a greater determination and let us move on in these powerful days these days of challenge to make america what it ought to be we have an opportunity to make america a better nation and i want to thank god once more for allowing me to be here with you 
 you know several years ago i was in new york city autographing the first book that i had written and while sitting there autographing books a demented black woman came up the only question i heard from her was are you martin luther king and i was looking down writing and i said yes and the next minute i felt something beating on my chest before i knew it i had been stabbed by this demented woman i was rushed to harlem hospital it was a dark saturday afternoon and that blade had gone through and the revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta the main artery and once punctured you drown in your own blood the end of you 
 it came out in the new york times the next morning that if i had merely sneezed i would have died well about four days later they allowed me after the operation after my chest had been opened and the blade had been taken out to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital they allowed me to read some of the mail that came in and from all over the states and the world kind letters came in i read a few but one of them i will never forget i had received one from the president and the forgotten what those telegrams said received a visit and a letter from the governor of new york but forgotten what that letter said but there was another letter that came from a little girl a young girl who was a student at the white plains high school and i looked at that letter and never forget it it said simply dear dr king i am a student at the white plains high school and she said while it should not matter i would like to mention that a white girl i read in the paper of your misfortune and of your suffering and i read that if you had sneezed you would have died and simply writing you to say that so happy that you sneeze 
 and i want to say tonight i want to say tonight that i too am happy that i sneeze because if i had sneezed i have been around here in when students all over the south started at lunch counters and i knew that as they were sitting in they were really standing up for the best in the american dream and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the declaration of independence and the constitution if i had sneezed i have been around here in when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in travel if i had sneezed i have been around here in when negroes in albany georgia decided to straighten their backs up and whenever men and women straighten their backs up they are going somewhere because a man ride your back unless it is bent if i had sneezed if i had sneezed i have been here in when the black people of birmingham alabama aroused the conscience of this nation and brought into being the civil rights bill if i had sneezed i have had a chance later that year in august to try to tell america about a dream that i had had if i had sneezed i have been down in selma alabama to see the great movement there if i had sneezed i have been in memphis to see a community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering so happy that i sneeze 
 and they were telling me now it matter now it really matter what happens now i left atlanta this morning and as we got started on the plane there were six of us the pilot said over the public address system we are sorry for the delay but we have dr martin luther king on the plane and to be sure that all of the bags were checked and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on the plane we had to check out everything carefully and had the plane protected and guarded all night 
 and then i got into memphis and some began to say the threats or talk about the threats that were out what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers 
 well i know what will happen now got some difficult days ahead but it matter with me now because been to the mountaintop and i mind 
 like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but not concerned about that now i just want to do will and allowed me to go up to the mountain and looked over and seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get will get to the promised land 
 and so happy tonight not worried about anything not fearing any man mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord 
 
 the man with the 
 theodore teddy roosevelt 
 delivered april 
 over a century ago washington laid the of the capitol in what was then little more than a tract of wooded wilderness here beside the potomac we now find it necessary to provide great additional buildings for the business of the government this growth in the need for the housing of the government is but a proof and example of the way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of action of the national government has grown we now administer the affairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of population has been outstripped by the growth of wealth and the growth in complex interests 
 the material problems that face us are not such as they were in washingtons time but the underlying facts of human nature are the same now as they were then under altered external form we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in washingtons time and are helped by the same tendencies for good 
 it is about some of these that i wish to say a word in bunyans pilgrims progress you may recall the description of the man with the the man who could look no way but downward with the in his hand who was offered a celestial crown for his but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he was offered but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor 
 in pilgrims progress the man with the is set forth as the example of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of on spiritual things yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only on that which is vile and debasing now it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing there is filth on the floor and it must be scraped up with the and there are times and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed but the man who never does anything else who never thinks or speaks or writes save of his feats with the speedily becomes not a help to society not an incitement to good but one of the most potent forces for evil 
 there are in the body politic economic and social many and grave evils and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them there should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man whether politician or business man every evil practice whether in politics in business or in social life i hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker every man who on the platform or in book magazine or newspaper with merciless severity makes such attack provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful the liar is no whit better than the thief and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves it puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully to attack an honest man or even with hysterical exaggeration to assail a bad man with untruth an epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon character does not good but very great harm the soul of every scoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed or even when a scoundrel is untruthfully assailed 
 now it is easy to twist out of shape what i have just said easy to affect to misunderstand it and if it is slurred over in repetition not difficult really to misunderstand it some persons are sincerely incapable of understanding that to denounce does not mean the endorsement of whitewashing and both the interested individuals who need whitewashing and those others who practice like to encourage such confusion of ideas one of the chief counts against those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business or men in public life is that they invite a reaction which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of the unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought to be attacked who ought to be exposed who ought if possible to be put in the penitentiary if aristides is praised overmuch as just people get tired of hearing it and overcensure of the unjust finally and from similar reasons results in their favor 
 any excess is almost sure to invite a reaction and unfortunately the reaction instead of taking the form of punishment of those guilty of the excess is very apt to take the form either of punishment of the unoffending or of giving immunity and even strength to offenders the effort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction of character can only result in public calamity gross and reckless assaults on character whether on the stump or in newspaper magazine or book create a morbid and vicious public sentiment and at the same time act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness and tend to prevent them from entering the public service at any price 
 as an instance in point i may mention that one serious difficulty encountered in getting the right type of men to dig the panama canal is the certainty that they will be exposed both without and i am sorry to say sometimes within congress to utterly reckless assaults on their character and capacity 
 at the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is not for immunity to but for the most unsparing exposure of the politician who betrays his trust of the big business man who makes or spends his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways there should be a resolute effort to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced expose the crime and hunt down the criminal but remember that even in the case of crime if it is attacked in sensational lurid and untruthful fashion the attack may do more damage to the public mind than the crime itself it is because i feel that there should be no rest in the endless war against the forces of evil that i ask that the war be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution 
 the men with the are often indispensable to the of society but only if they know when to stop raking the muck and to look upward to the celestial crown above them to the crown of worthy endeavor 
 there are beautiful things above and roundabout them and if they gradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck their power of usefulness is gone if the whole picture is painted black there remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals for distinction from their fellows such painting finally induces a kind of moral and people affected by it come to the conclusion that no man is really black and no man is really white but they are all gray in other words they neither believe in the truth of the attack nor in the honesty of the man who is attacked they grow as suspicious of the accusation as of the offense it becomes hopeless to stir them either to wrath against or to enthusiasm for what is right and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every knave and is the despair of honest men 
 to assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial life with such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent men in the general condemnation means the searing of the public conscience there results a general attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference to public corruption or else of a distrustful inability to discriminate between the good and the bad either attitude is fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole the fool who has not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses the bad there is nothing more distressing to every good patriot to every good american than the hard scoffing spirit which treats the allegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter 
 such laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot for it denotes not merely the vacant mind but the heart in which high emotions have been choked before they could grow to fruition 
 there is any amount of good in the world and there never was a time when loftier and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind was being done than now the forces that tend for evil are great and terrible but the forces of truth and love and courage and honesty and generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before it is a foolish and timid no less than a wicked thing to blink the fact that the forces of evil are strong but it is even worse to fail to take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good 
 hysterical sensationalism is the very poorest weapon wherewith to fight for lasting righteousness the men who with stern sobriety and truth assail the many evils of our time whether in the public press or in magazines or in books are the leaders and allies of all engaged in the work for social and political betterment but if they give good reason for distrust of what they say if they chill the ardor of those who demand truth as a primary virtue they thereby betray the good cause and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are nominally at war 
 in his ecclesiastical polity that fine old elizabethan divine bishop hooker wrote he that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favorable hearers because they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject but the secret lets and difficulties which in public proceedings are innumerable and inevitable they have not ordinarily the judgment to consider 
 this truth should be kept constantly in mind by every free people desiring to preserve the sanity and poise indispensable to the permanent success of yet on the other hand it is vital not to permit this spirit to sanity and to degenerate into mere mental stagnation bad though a state of hysterical excitement is and evil though the results are which come from the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces yet a sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse 
 at this moment we are passing through a period of great unrestsocial political and industrial unrest it is of the utmost importance for our future that this should prove to be not the unrest of mere rebelliousness against life of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality of conditions but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to secure the betterment of the individual and the nation so far as this movement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce discontent with evil of a determination to punish the authors of evil whether in industry or politics the feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a sign of healthy life 
 if on the other hand it turns into a mere crusade of appetite against appetite of a contest between the brutal greed of the and the brutal greed of the haves then it has no significance for good but only for evil if it seeks to establish a line of cleavage not along the line which divides good men from bad but along that other line running at right angles thereto which divides those who are well off from those who are less well off then it will be fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic 
 we can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital the wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate to an account for his misdeeds is as bad as and no worse than the labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in murder one attitude is as bad as the other and no worse in each case the accused is entitled to exact justice and in neither case is there need of action by others which can be construed into an expression of sympathy for crime 
 it is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in permanent good the emotion shall be translated into action and that the action shall be marked by honesty sanity and there is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform the reform that counts is that which comes through steady continuous growth violent emotionalism leads to exhaustion 
 it is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of enormous fortunes and the use of those fortunes both corporate and individual in business we should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes and fortunes between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere 
 of course no amount of charity in spending such fortunes in any way compensates for misconduct in making them as a matter of personal conviction and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate the system i feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes beyond a certain amount either given in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individuala tax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual the tax of course to be imposed by the national and not the state government 
 such taxation should of course be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits again the national government must in some form exercise supervision over corporations engaged in interstate businessand all large corporations are engaged in interstate businesswhether by license or otherwise so as to permit us to deal with the evils of overcapitalization 
 this year we are making a beginning in the direction of serious effort to settle some of these economic problems by the legislation such legislation if so framed as i am sure it will be as to secure definite and tangible results will amount to something of itself and it will amount to a great deal more in so far as it is taken as a first step in the direction of a policy of superintendence and control over corporate wealth engaged in interstate commerce this superintendence and control not to be exercised in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created the wealth but with the firm purpose both to do justice to them and to see that they in their turn do justice to the public at large 
 the first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this shape with corporations whether as legislators or as executives is honesty this honesty can be no respecter of persons there can be no such thing as unilateral honesty the danger is not really from corrupt corporations it springs from the corruption itself whether exercised for or against corporations 
 the eighth commandment reads thou shalt not steal it does not read thou shalt not steal from the rich man it does not read thou shalt not steal from the poor man it reads simply and plainly thou shalt not steal 
 no good whatever will come from that warped and mock morality which denounces the misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their expense which denounces bribery but blinds itself to blackmail which foams with rage if a corporation secures favors by improper methods and merely leers with hideous mirth if the corporation is itself wronged the only public servant who can be trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against the misdeeds of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely protect the corporation itself from wrongful aggression 
 if a public man is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of wealth or to rich corporations it may be set down as certain that if the opportunity comes he will secretly and furtively do wrong to the public in the interest of a corporation 
 but in addition to honesty we need sanity no honesty will make public man useful if that man is timid or foolish if he is a zealot or an impracticable visionary 
 as we strive for reform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long pull on the contrary there is almost as much of breeching work as of collar work to depend only on traces means that there will soon be a runaway and an upset 
 the men of wealth who today are trying to prevent the regulation and control of their business in the interest of the public by the proper government authorities will not succeed in my judgment in checking the progress of the movement but if they did succeed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely reap the whirlwind for they would ultimately provoke the violent excesses which accompany a reform coming by convulsion instead of by steady and natural growth 
 on the other hand the wild preachers of unrest and discontent the wild agitators against the entire existing order the men who act crookedly whether because of sinister design or from mere the men who preach destruction without proposing any substitute for what they intend to destroy or who propose a substitute which would be far worse than the existing evilsall these men are the most dangerous opponents of real reform if they get their way they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which they could fall under the present system if they fail to get their way they will still do incalculable harm by provoking the kind of reaction which in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching would enthrone more securely than ever the very evils which their misguided followers believe they are attacking 
 more important then aught else is the development of the broadest sympathy of man for man the welfare of the the welfare of the tiller of the soil upon these depend the welfare of the entire country their good is not to be sought in pulling down others but their good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship 
 materially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity for all men so that each shall have a better chance to show the stuff of which he is made 
 spiritually and ethically we must strive to bring about clean living and right thinking we appreciate also that the things of the soul are immeasurably more important 
 the of national life is and ever must be the high individual character of the average citizen 
 
 remarks on the assassination of martin luther king jr 
 robert f kennedy 
 delivered april indianapolis in 
 ladies and gentlemen only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening because i have some very sad news for all of you could you lower those signs please i have some very sad news for all of you and i think sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world and that is that martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis tennessee 
 martin luther king dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings he died in the cause of that effort in this difficult day in this difficult time for the united states perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in for those of you who are black considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible you can be filled with bitterness and with hatred and a desire for revenge 
 we can move in that direction as a country in greater polarization black people amongst blacks and white amongst whites filled with hatred toward one another or we can make an effort as martin luther king did to understand and to comprehend and replace that violence that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to understand compassion and love 
 for those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people i would only say that i can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling i had a member of my family killed but he was killed by a white man 
 but we have to make an effort in the united states we have to make an effort to understand to get beyond or go beyond these rather difficult times 
 my favorite poem my favorite poet was aeschylus and he once wrote 
 even in our sleep pain which cannot forget 
 falls drop by drop upon the heart 
 until in our own despair 
 against our will 
 comes wisdom 
 through the awful grace of god 
 what we need in the united states is not division what we need in the united states is not hatred what we need in the united states is not violence and lawlessness but is love and wisdom and compassion toward one another and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country whether they be white or whether they be black 
 so i ask you tonight to return home to say a prayer for the family of martin luther king yeah true but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country which all of us love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which i spoke 
 we can do well in this country we will have difficult times had difficult times in the past and we will have difficult times in the future it is not the end of violence it is not the end of lawlessness and not the end of disorder 
 but the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together want to improve the quality of our life and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land 
 let us dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world let us dedicate ourselves to that and say a prayer for our country and for our people 
 thank you very much 
 
 farewell address 
 dwight d eisenhower 
 delivered january 
 good evening my fellow americans 
 first i should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunities they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation my special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening 
 three days from now after a half century in the service of our country i shall lay down the responsibilities of office as in traditional and solemn ceremony the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor 
 this evening i come to you with a message of and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you my countrymen like every other citizen i wish the new president and all who will labor with him godspeed i pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all 
 our people expect their president and the congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation my own relations with the congress which began on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a member of the senate appointed me to west point have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate period and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years in this final relationship the congress and the administration have on most vital issues cooperated well to serve the nation good rather than mere partisanship and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward so my official relationship with congress ends in a feeling on my part of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together 
 we now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations three of these involved our own country despite these holocausts america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this we yet realize that leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment 
 throughout adventure in free government our basic purposes have been to keep the peace to foster progress in human achievement and to enhance liberty dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations to strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad 
 progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world it commands our whole attention absorbs our very beings we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration to meet it successfully there is called for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily surely and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake only thus shall we remain despite every provocation on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment 
 crises there will continue to be in meeting them whether foreign or domestic great or small there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties a huge increase in newer elements of our defenses development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research these and many other possibilities each possibly promising in itself may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel 
 but each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national programs balance between the private and the public economy balance between the cost and hoped for advantages balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future good judgment seeks balance and progress lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration the record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have in the main understood these truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress 
 but threats new in kind or degree constantly arise of these i mention two only 
 a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii or korea 
 until the latest of our world conflicts the united states had no armaments industry american makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment we annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all united states corporations 
 now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every statehouse every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society 
 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together 
 akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades in this revolution research has become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly a steadily increasing share is conducted for by or at the direction of the federal government 
 today the solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields in the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers the prospect of domination of the scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded 
 yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a elite 
 it is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces new and old within the principles of our democratic system c ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society 
 another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time as we peer into future we you and i and our government must avoid the impulse to live only for today plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage we want democracy to survive for all generations to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow 
 during the long lane of the history yet to be written america knows that this world of ours ever growing smaller must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate and be instead a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect such a confederation must be one of equals the weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we protected as we are by our moral economic and military strength that table though scarred by many past frustrations cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield 
 disarmament with mutual honor and confidence is a continuing imperative together we must learn how to compose differences not with arms but with intellect and decent purpose because this need is so sharp and apparent i confess that i lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment as one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years i wish i could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight 
 happily i can say that war has been avoided steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made but so much remains to be done as a private citizen i shall never cease to do what little i can to help the world advance along that road 
 so in this my last good night to you as your president i thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace i trust that in that service you find some things worthy as for the rest of it i know you will find ways to improve performance in the future 
 you and i my fellow citizens need to be strong in our faith that all nations under god will reach the goal of peace with justice may we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle confident but humble with power diligent in pursuit of the nations great goals 
 to all the peoples of the world i once more give expression to prayerful and continuing aspiration we pray that peoples of all faiths all races all nations may have their great human needs satisfied that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity and that the scourges of poverty disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth and that in the goodness of time all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love 
 now on friday noon i am to become a private citizen i am proud to do so i look forward to it 
 thank you and good night 
 
 war message 
 woodrow wilson 
 delivered april 
 gentlemen of the congress 
 i have called the congress into extraordinary session because there are serious very serious choices of policy to be made and made immediately which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that i should assume the responsibility of making 
 on the third of february last i officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the imperial german government that on and after the first day of february it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of great britain and ireland or the western coasts of europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of germany within the mediterranean 
 that had seemed to be the object of the german submarine warfare earlier in the war but since april of last year the imperial government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy when no resistance was offered or escape attempted and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats 
 the precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business but a certain degree of restraint was observed the new policy has swept every restriction aside vessels of every kind whatever their flag their character their cargo their destination their errand have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of belgium though the latter were provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the german government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity haven been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle 
 i was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations international law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world by painful stage after stage has that law been built up with meager enough results indeed after all was accomplished that could be accomplished but always with a clear view at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded 
 this minimum of right the german government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world 
 i am not now thinking of the loss of property involved immense and serious as that is but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of men women and children engaged in pursuits which have always even in the darkest periods of modern history been deemed innocent and legitimate property can be paid for the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be 
 the present german submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind 
 it is war against all nations 
 american ships have been sunk american lives taken in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way there has been no discrimination the challenge is to all mankind 
 each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it the choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation we must put excited feeling away our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication of right of human right of which we are only a single champion 
 when i addressed the congress on the of february last i thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms our right to use the seas against unlawful interference our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence but armed neutrality it now appears is impracticable because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the german submarines have been used against merchant shipping it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers visible craft giving chase upon the open sea it is common prudence in such circumstances grim necessity indeed to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention they must be dealt with upon sight if dealt with at all 
 the german government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend the intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents there is one choice we cannot make we are incapable of making we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated the wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs they cut to the very roots of human life 
 with a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step i am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves but in unhesitating obedience to what i deem my constitutional duty i advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial german government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the united states that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the government of the german empire to terms and end the war 
 what this will involve is clear 
 it will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with germany and as incident to that the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs 
 it will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible 
 it will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemys submarines 
 it will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the united states already provided for by law in case of war at least five hundred thousand men who should in my opinion be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training 
 it will involve also of course the granting of adequate credits to the government sustained i hope so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation by well conceived taxation 
 i say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed it is our duty i most respectfully urge to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast loans 
 in carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdoms of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our own military forces with the duty for it will be a very practical duty of supplying the nations already at war with germany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance they are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective there 
 i shall take the liberty of suggesting through the several executive departments of the government for the consideration of your committees measures for the accomplishment of the several objects i have mentioned i hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed after very careful thought by the branch of the government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war safeguarding the nation will most directly fall 
 while we do these things these deeply momentous things let us be very clear and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are my own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months and i do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them i have exactly the same things in mind now that i had in mind when i addressed the senate on the of january last the same that i had in mind when i addressed the congress on the third day of february and on the of february our object now as then is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and peoples of the world 
 such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles 
 neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will not by the will of their people we have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances we are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states 
 we have no quarrel with the german people we have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship it was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war it was not with their previous knowledge or approval it was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools 
 nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression carried it may be from generation to generation can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class they are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nations affairs 
 a steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations no autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants it must be a league of honor a partnership of opinion intrigue would eat its vitals away the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own 
 does not every american feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in russia russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart in all the vital habits of her thought in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct their habitual attitude towards life 
 the autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power was not in fact russian in origin character or purpose and now it has been shaken off and the great generous russian people have been added in all their majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world for justice and for peace here is a fit partner for a league of honor 
 one of the things that has served to convince us that the prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel our peace within and without our industries and our commerce indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation wit the support and even under the personal direction of official agents of the imperial government accredited to the government of the united states 
 even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we know that their source lay not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the german people towards us who were no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves were but only in the selfish designs of a government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing but they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience that it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors that intercepted note to the german minister at mexico city is eloquent evidence 
 we are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government following such methods we can never have a friend and that in the presence of its organized power always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose there can be no assured security of the democratic governments of the world we are now about to accept a gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall if necessary spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power 
 we are glad now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples the german peoples included for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience the world must be made safe for democracy its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty we have no selfish ends to serve 
 we desire no conquest no dominion we seek no indemnities for ourselves no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall cheerfully make we are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind we shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them 
 just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples we shall i feel confident conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for i have said nothing of the governments allied with the imperial government of germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor 
 the government has indeed avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the imperial german government and it has therefore not been possible for this government to receive count tarnowski the ambassador recently accredited to this government by the imperial and royal government of but that government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the united states on the seas and i take the liberty for the present at least of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at vienna 
 we enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights 
 it will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them but only armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck 
 we are let me say again the sincere friends of the german people and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us however hard it may be for them for the time being to believe that this is spoken from our hearts 
 we have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible 
 we shall happily still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of german birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test they are most of them as true and loyal americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance they will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose if there should be disloyalty it will be dealt with a firm hand of stern repression but if it lifts its head at all it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few 
 it is a distressing and oppressive duty gentlemen of the congress which i have performed in thus addressing you there are it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars civilization itself seeming to be in the balance 
 but the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments for the rights and liberties of small nations for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world at last free 
 to such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day has come when america is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured god helping her she can do no other

 on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party they always liked sitting there after dinner and that day they had work to do there too besides the sewing of chemises and knitting of swaddles with which all of them were busy that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to agathya mikhailovna without the addition of water kitty had introduced this new method which had been in use in her home agathya mikhailovna to whom the task of jam making had always been intrusted considering that what had been done in the levin household could not be amiss had nevertheless put water with the strawberries maintaining that the jam could not be made without it she had been caught in the act and was now making raspberry jam before everyone and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water 
 agathya mikhailovna her face heated and angry her hair untidy and her thin arms bare to the elbows was swaying the preserving pan in a circular motion over the charcoal stove looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly the princess conscious that agathya wrath must be chiefly directed against her as the person responsible for the raspberry jam making tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the raspberries talking of other matters but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove 
 i always buy my maids dresses myself at the bargain sale the princess said continuing the previous conversation it time to skim it my dear she added addressing agathya mikhailovna not the slightest need for you to do it and hot for you she said stopping kitty 
 do it said dolly and getting up she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with scum and syrup how lick this at teatime she thought of her children remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the people did not eat what was best of all the scum of the jam 
 stiva says much better to give money dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion of what presents should be made to servants but 
 out of the question the princess and kitty exclaimed with one voice they appreciate a present 
 well last year for instance i bought our matriona semionovna not a poplin but something of that sort said the princess 
 i remember she was wearing it on your name day 
 a charming pattern so simple and refined i should have liked it myself if she had it something like so pretty and inexpensive 
 well now i think done said dolly dropping the syrup from the spoon 
 when it sets as it drops ready cook it a little longer agathya mikhailovna 
 the flies said agathya mikhailovna angrily be just the same she added 
 ah how sweet it is frighten it kitty said suddenly looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry 
 yes but you keep a little further from the stove said her mother 
 a propos de varenka said kitty speaking in french as they had been doing all the while so that agathya mikhailovna should not understand them you know maman i somehow expect things to be settled today you know what i mean how splendid it would be 
 but what a famous matchmaker she is said dolly how carefully and cleverly she throws them together 
 no tell me mamma what do you think 
 why what is one to think he he meant sergei ivanovich might at any time have been one of the best matches in russia now of course not quite a young man still i know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now a very nice girl but he might 
 oh no mamma do understand why for him and for her too nothing better could be imagined in the first place charming said kitty crooking one of her fingers 
 he thinks her very attractive certain assented dolly 
 then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife all he needs is a good sweet wife a restful one 
 well with her he would certainly be restful dolly assented 
 thirdly that she should love him and so it is that is it would be so splendid i look forward to seeing them coming out of the forest and everything settled i shall see at once by their eyes i should be so delighted what do you think dolly 
 but excite yourself not at all the thing for you to be excited said her mother 
 oh not excited mamma i fancy he will propose to her today 
 ah so strange how and when a man proposes there is a sort of barrier and all at once broken down said dolly smiling pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevich 
 mamma how did papa propose to you kitty asked suddenly 
 there was nothing out of the way it was very simple answered the princess but her face beamed all over at the recollection 
 oh but how was it you loved him at any rate before you were allowed to speak 
 kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a life 
 of course i did he had come to stay with us in the country 
 but how was it settled between you mamma 
 you imagine i dare say that you invented something quite new always just the same it was settled by the eyes by smiles 
 how well you said that mamma just by the eyes by smiles that done dolly assented 
 but what words did he say 
 what did kostia say to you 
 he wrote it in chalk it was wonderful how long ago it seems she said 
 and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing kitty was the first to break the silence she remembered all that last winter before her marriage and her passion for vronsky 
 one thing that old love affair of she said a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point i should have liked to say something to sergei ivanovich to prepare him all all men i mean she added awfully jealous over our past 
 not all said dolly you judge by your own husband it makes him miserable even now to remember vronsky eh true it 
 yes kitty answered a pensive smile in her eyes 
 but i really know the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter what there was in your past that could worry him that vronsky paid you attentions that happens to every girl 
 oh yes but we mean that kitty said flushing a little 
 no let me speak her mother went on why you yourself would not let me have a talk with vronsky you remember 
 oh mamma said kitty with an expression of suffering 
 no keeping you young people in check nowadays your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable i should myself have called upon him to explain himself but my darling not right for you to be agitated please remember that and calm yourself 
 perfectly calm maman 
 how happy it was for kitty that anna came then said dolly and how unhappy for her it turned out quite the opposite she said struck by her own ideas then anna was so happy and kitty thought herself unhappy now it is just the opposite i often think of her 
 a fine person to think about horrid repulsive woman no heart said her mother who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky but levin 
 what do you want to talk of it for kitty said with annoyance i never think about it and i want to think of it and i want to think of it she said catching the sound of her familiar step on the steps of the terrace 
 that you want to think about inquired levin coming onto the terrace 
 but no one answered him and he did not repeat the question 
 sorry broken in on your feminine kingdom he said looking round on everyone discontentedly and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him 
 for a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of agathya mikhailovna vexation at their making jam without water and on the whole at the outside shcherbatsky authority he smiled however and went up to kitty 
 well how are you he asked her looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now 
 oh very well said kitty smiling and how have things gone with you 
 the wagon held three times as much as the telega did well are we going for the children ordered the horses to be put in 
 what you want to take kitty in the wide droshky her mother said reproachfully 
 yes at walking pace princess 
 levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their and the princess disliked his not doing so but though he liked and respected the princess levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother 
 come with us maman said kitty 
 i like to see such imprudence 
 well walk then so well kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand 
 you may be well but everything in moderation said the princess 
 well agathya mikhailovna is the jam done said levin smiling to agathya mikhailovna and trying to cheer her up is it all right in the new way 
 i suppose all right according to our notions boiled too long 
 be all the better agathya mikhailovna it turn sour even though the ice in our icehouse has begun to melt already so that no cool place to store it said kitty at once divining her motive and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling but your pickles are so good that mamma says she never tasted any like them she added smiling and putting her kerchief straight 
 agathya mikhailovna looked sulkily at kitty 
 you try to console me mistress i need only to look at you with him and i feel happy she said and something in the rough familiarity of that with him touched kitty 
 come along with us to look for mushrooms you will show us the best places 
 agathya mikhailovna smiled and shook her head as though to say i would even like to be angry with you but i 
 do it please according to my recipe said the princess put some paper over the jam and moisten it with a little rum and even without ice it will never grow moldy

 agathya mikhailovna her face heated and angry her hair untidy and her thin arms bare to the elbows was swaying the preserving pan in a circular motion over the charcoal stove looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly the princess conscious that agathya wrath must be chiefly directed against her as the person responsible for the raspberry jam making tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the raspberries talking of other matters but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove 
 i always buy my maids dresses myself at the bargain sale the princess said continuing the previous conversation it time to skim it my dear she added addressing agathya mikhailovna not the slightest need for you to do it and hot for you she said stopping kitty 
 do it said dolly and getting up she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with scum and syrup how lick this at teatime she thought of her children remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the people did not eat what was best of all the scum of the jam 
 stiva says much better to give money dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion of what presents should be made to servants but 
 out of the question the princess and kitty exclaimed with one voice they appreciate a present 
 well last year for instance i bought our matriona semionovna not a poplin but something of that sort said the princess

 a charming pattern so simple and refined i should have liked it myself if she had it something like so pretty and inexpensive 
 well now i think done said dolly dropping the syrup from the spoon 
 when it sets as it drops ready cook it a little longer agathya mikhailovna 
 the flies said agathya mikhailovna angrily be just the same she added 
 ah how sweet it is frighten it kitty said suddenly looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry

 kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face always so quick to reflect every feeling at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of and had got no answer 
 when they had set off on foot ahead of the others and had gotten out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road sprinkled with ears of rye and with separate grains she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her he had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression and alone with her he felt now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind a new and delicious bliss quite pure from all alloy of sense in being near to the woman he loved there was no need of speech yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice which like her eyes had changed since she had become pregnant in her voice as in her eyes there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit 
 so not tired lean more on me said he 
 no so glad of a chance of being alone with you and i must own though happy with them i sigh for our winter evenings alone 
 that was good but this is even better both are better he said squeezing her hand 
 do you know what we were talking about when you came in 
 about jam 
 oh yes about jam too but afterward about how men propose 
 ah said levin listening more to the sound of her voice than to her words and all the while paying attention to the road which passed now through the forest and avoiding places where she might make a false step 
 and about sergei ivanovich and varenka noticed very anxious for it she went on what do you think about it and she peeped into his face 
 i know what to think levin answered smiling sergei seems very strange to me in that way i told you you know 
 yes that he was in love with that girl who died 
 that was when i was a child i know about it from hearsay and tradition i remember him then he was wonderfully sweet but watched him since with women he is friendly some of them he likes but one feels that to him simply people not women 
 yes but now with varenka i fancy something 
 perhaps there is but one has to know him a peculiar wonderful person he lives a spiritual life only too pure too exalted a nature 
 why would this lower him then 
 no but so used to a spiritual life that he reconcile himself with actual fact and varenka is after all fact 
 levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language he knew that his wife in such moments of loving tenderness as now would understand what he meant to say from a hint and she did understand him 
 yes but not so much of that actual fact about her as about me i can see that he would never have cared for me she is altogether spiritual 
 oh no he is so fond of you and i am always so glad when my people like you 
 yes very good to me but 
 not as it was with poor nikolenka you really cared for each other levin finished why not speak of him he added i sometimes blame myself for not doing so it ends in forgetting ah how terrible and dear he was yes what were we talking about levin said after a pause 
 you think he fall in love said kitty translating into her own language 
 not so much that he fall in love levin said smiling but he has not the weakness necessary always envied him and even now when so happy i still envy him 
 you envy him for not being able to fall in love 
 i envy him for being better than me said levin he does not live for himself his whole life is subordinated to his duty and why he can be calm and contented 
 and you kitty asked with an ironical and loving smile 
 she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile but the last link in it was that her husband in exalting his brother and abasing himself was not quite sincere kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother from his sense of shame at being too happy and above all from his unflagging craving to be better she loved this trait in him and so she smiled 
 and you what are you dissatisfied with she asked with the same smile 
 her disbelief in his delighted him and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief 
 i am happy but dissatisfied with myself he said 
 why how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy 
 well how shall i say in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble see oh but really you skip about like that he cried breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path but when i think about myself and compare myself with others especially with my brother i feel a poor creature 
 but in what way kitty pursued with the same smile you too work for others what about your farmsteading and your agriculture and your book 
 oh but i feel and particularly just now your fault he said pressing her hand that all that count i do it in a way halfheartedly if i could care for all that as i care for you instead of that i do it in these days like a task that is set me 
 well what would you say about papa asked kitty is he a poor creature then as he does nothing for the public good 
 he no but then one must have the simplicity the the goodness of your father and i got that i do nothing and i fret about it all your doing before you and this too he added with a glance toward her waist that she understood i put all my energies into work now i and ashamed i do it just as though it were a task set me pretending 
 well but would you like to change this minute with sergei ivanovich said kitty would you like to do this work for the general good and to love the task set you as he does and nothing else 
 of course not said levin but so happy that i understand anything so you think propose to her today he added after a brief silence 
 i think so and i think so only awfully anxious for it here wait a minute she stooped down and picked a wild daisy at the edge of the path come count he will he she said giving him the flower 
 he will he said levin tearing off the white petals

 kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face always so quick to reflect every feeling at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of and had got no answer 
 when they had set off on foot ahead of the others and had gotten out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road sprinkled with ears of rye and with separate grains she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her he had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression and alone with her he felt now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind a new and delicious bliss quite pure from all alloy of sense in being near to the woman he loved there was no need of speech yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice which like her eyes had changed since she had become pregnant in her voice as in her eyes there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit 
 so not tired lean more on me said he 
 no so glad of a chance of being alone with you and i must own though happy with them i sigh for our winter evenings alone 
 that was good but this is even better both are better he said squeezing her hand 
 do you know what we were talking about when you came in 
 about jam 
 oh yes about jam too but afterward about how men propose 
 ah said levin listening more to the sound of her voice than to her words and all the while paying attention to the road which passed now through the forest and avoiding places where she might make a false step 
 and about sergei ivanovich and varenka noticed very anxious for it she went on what do you think about it and she peeped into his face 
 i know what to think levin answered smiling sergei seems very strange to me in that way i told you you know 
 yes that he was in love with that girl who died 
 that was when i was a child i know about it from hearsay and tradition i remember him then he was wonderfully sweet but watched him since with women he is friendly some of them he likes but one feels that to him simply people not women 
 yes but now with varenka i fancy something 
 perhaps there is but one has to know him a peculiar wonderful person he lives a spiritual life only too pure too exalted a nature 
 why would this lower him then 
 no but so used to a spiritual life that he reconcile himself with actual fact and varenka is after all fact 
 levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language he knew that his wife in such moments of loving tenderness as now would understand what he meant to say from a hint and she did understand him 
 yes but not so much of that actual fact about her as about me i can see that he would never have cared for me she is altogether spiritual 
 oh no he is so fond of you and i am always so glad when my people like you 
 yes very good to me but 
 not as it was with poor nikolenka you really cared for each other levin finished why not speak of him he added i sometimes blame myself for not doing so it ends in forgetting ah how terrible and dear he was yes what were we talking about levin said after a pause 
 you think he fall in love said kitty translating into her own language 
 not so much that he fall in love levin said smiling but he has not the weakness necessary always envied him and even now when so happy i still envy him 
 you envy him for not being able to fall in love 
 i envy him for being better than me said levin he does not live for himself his whole life is subordinated to his duty and why he can be calm and contented 
 and you kitty asked with an ironical and loving smile 
 she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile but the last link in it was that her husband in exalting his brother and abasing himself was not quite sincere kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother from his sense of shame at being too happy and above all from his unflagging craving to be better she loved this trait in him and so she smiled 
 and you what are you dissatisfied with she asked with the same smile 
 her disbelief in his delighted him and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief 
 i am happy but dissatisfied with myself he said 
 why how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy 
 well how shall i say in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble see oh but really you skip about like that he cried breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path but when i think about myself and compare myself with others especially with my brother i feel a poor creature 
 but in what way kitty pursued with the same smile you too work for others what about your farmsteading and your agriculture and your book 
 oh but i feel and particularly just now your fault he said pressing her hand that all that count i do it in a way halfheartedly if i could care for all that as i care for you instead of that i do it in these days like a task that is set me 
 well what would you say about papa asked kitty is he a poor creature then as he does nothing for the public good 
 he no but then one must have the simplicity the the goodness of your father and i got that i do nothing and i fret about it all your doing before you and this too he added with a glance toward her waist that she understood i put all my energies into work now i and ashamed i do it just as though it were a task set me pretending 
 well but would you like to change this minute with sergei ivanovich said kitty would you like to do this work for the general good and to love the task set you as he does and nothing else 
 of course not said levin but so happy that i understand anything so you think propose to her today he added after a brief silence 
 i think so and i think so only awfully anxious for it here wait a minute she stooped down and picked a wild daisy at the edge of the path come count he will he she said giving him the flower 
 he will he said levin tearing off the white petals 
 no no kitty snatching at his hand stopped him she had been watching his fingers with agitation you picked off two 
 oh but see this little one count to make up said levin tearing off a little petal the droshky overtaking us 
 you tired kitty called the princess 
 not in the least

 if so he said to himself i ought to think it over and make up my mind and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment 
 going to pick by myself apart from all the rest or else my efforts will make no show he said and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart and went more into the heart of the wood where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel walking some forty paces away sergei ivanovich knowing he was out of sight stood still behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its catkins it was perfectly still all round him only overhead in the birches under which he stood the flies like a swarm of bees buzzed unceasingly and from time to time the voices floated across to him all at once he heard not far from the edge of the wood the sound of contralto voice calling grisha and a smile of delight passed over sergei face conscious of this smile he shook his head disapprovingly at his own state and taking out a cigar he began lighting it for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree the soft pellicle of the white bark stuck around the phosphorus and the light went out at last one of the matches burned and the fragrant cigar smoke hovering uncertainly in flat wide coils stretched away forward and upward over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree watching the streak of smoke sergei ivanovich walked gently on deliberating on his position 
 why not he thought if it were only a flash in the pan or a passion if it were only this attraction this mutual attraction i can call it a mutual attraction yet if i felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life if i felt that in giving way to this attraction i should be false to my vocation and my duty but not so the only thing i can say against it is that when i lost marie i said to myself that i would remain faithful to her memory the only thing i can say against my feeling a great thing sergei ivanovich said to himself feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others but apart from that however much i searched i should never find anything to say against my feeling if i were choosing by considerations of intellect alone i could not have found anything better 
 however many women and girls he thought of whom he knew he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all positively all the qualities he would wish to see in his wife she had all the charm and freshness of youth but she was not a child and if she loved him she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love that was one thing another point she was not only far from being worldly but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society and at the same time she knew the world and had all the ways of a woman of the best society which were absolutely essential to sergei conception of the woman who was to share his life thirdly she was religious and not like a child unconsciously religious and good as kitty for example was but her life was founded on religious principles even in trifling matters sergei ivanovich found in her all that he wanted in his wife she was poor and alone in the world so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her house as he saw now in case she would owe everything to her husband which was what he had always desired too for his future family life and this girl who united all these qualities loved him he was a modest man but he could not help seeing it and he loved her there was one consideration against it his age but he came of a family he had not a single gray hair no one would have taken him for forty and he remembered saying that it was only in russia that men of fifty thought themselves old and that in france a man of fifty considers himself dans la force de while a man of forty is un jeune homme but what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago was it not youth to feel as he felt now when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the graceful figure of varenka in her yellow gown with her basket walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree and when this impression of the sight of varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view of the yellow oat field lying bathed in the slanting sunshine and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance his heart throbbed joyously a softened feeling came over him he felt that he had made up his mind varenka who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom rose with a supple movement and looked round flinging away the cigar sergei ivanovich advanced with resolute steps toward her

 varenka with her white kerchief on her black hair surrounded by the children gaily and looking after them and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for was very attractive sergei ivanovich walked beside her and never left off admiring her looking at her he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips all the good he knew about her and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long long ago and only once in his early youth the feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew and at last reached such a point that as he put a huge mushroom with rolled brims in her basket he looked straight into her face and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face he was confused himself and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much 
 if so he said to himself i ought to think it over and make up my mind and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment 
 going to pick by myself apart from all the rest or else my efforts will make no show he said and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart and went more into the heart of the wood where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel walking some forty paces away sergei ivanovich knowing he was out of sight stood still behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its catkins it was perfectly still all round him only overhead in the birches under which he stood the flies like a swarm of bees buzzed unceasingly and from time to time the voices floated across to him all at once he heard not far from the edge of the wood the sound of contralto voice calling grisha and a smile of delight passed over sergei face conscious of this smile he shook his head disapprovingly at his own state and taking out a cigar he began lighting it for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree the soft pellicle of the white bark stuck around the phosphorus and the light went out at last one of the matches burned and the fragrant cigar smoke hovering uncertainly in flat wide coils stretched away forward and upward over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree watching the streak of smoke sergei ivanovich walked gently on deliberating on his position

 varvara andreevna when i was very young i set before myself the ideal of the woman i loved and should be happy to call my wife i have lived through a long life and now for the first time i have met what i sought in you i love you and offer you my hand 
 sergei ivanovich was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from varenka kneeling down with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from grisha she was calling little masha 
 come here little ones there are so many she was saying in her sweet deep voice 
 seeing sergei ivanovich approaching she did not get up and did not change her position but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it 
 well did you find some she asked from under the white kerchief turning her handsome gently smiling face to him 
 not one said sergei ivanovich did you 
 she did not answer busy with the children who thronged about her 
 that one too near the twig she pointed out to little masha a little fungus split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself varenka got up while masha picked the fungus breaking it into two white halves this brings back my childhood she added moving apart from the children to sergei side 
 they walked on for a few steps in silence varenka saw that he wanted to speak she guessed of what and felt faint with joy and panic they had walked so far away that no one could hear them now but still he did not begin it would have been better for varenka to be silent after a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms but against her own will as it were accidentally varenka said 
 so you found nothing in the middle of the wood there are always fewer though 
 sergei ivanovich sighed and made no answer he was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms he wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood but after a pause of some length as though against his own will he made an observation in response to her last words 
 i have heard that the white edible fungi are found principally at the edge of the wood though i tell them apart 
 some minutes more passed they moved still farther away from the children and were quite alone heart throbbed so that she heard it beating and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again 
 to be the wife of a man like koznishev after her position with madame stahl was to her imagination the height of happiness besides she was almost certain that she was in love with him and this moment it would have to be decided she felt frightened she dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking 
 now or never it must be said sergei ivanovich felt that too everything in the expression the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of varenka betrayed a painful suspense sergei ivanovich saw it and felt sorry for her he felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision he even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his proposal but instead of those words some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask 
 what is the difference between the birch mushroom and the white mushroom 
 lips quivered with emotion as she answered 
 in the top part there is scarcely any difference in the stalk 
 and as soon as these words were uttered both he and she felt that it was over that what was to have been said would not be said and their emotion which up to then had been continually growing more intense began to subside 
 the birch stalk suggests a dark chin after two days without shaving said sergei ivanovich speaking quite calmly now 
 yes true answered varenka smiling and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed they began to turn toward the children varenka felt both hurt and ashamed at the same time she felt a sense of relief 
 when he had got home again and went over the whole set of arguments sergei ivanovich thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one he could not be false to the memory of marie 
 gently children gently levin shouted quite angrily to the children standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them 
 behind the children sergei ivanovich and varenka walked out of the forest kitty had no need to ask varenka she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off 
 well her husband questioned her as they were going home again 
 no bites said kitty her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father a likeness levin often noticed with pleasure 
 no bites how 
 show you she said taking her hand lifting it to her mouth and just faintly brushing it with closed lips like a kiss on a hand 
 which one bite he said laughing 
 both but it should have been like this

 during the time of the tea the grownups sat on the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened though they all especially sergei ivanovich and varenka were very well aware that there had happened an event which though negative was of very great importance they both had the same feeling rather like that of a schoolboy after an unlucky examination which has left him in the same class or shut him out of school forever everyone present also feeling that something had happened talked eagerly about extraneous subjects levin and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening and their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable reference to those who would have liked to feel the same and could not and they felt a prick of conscience 
 mark my words alexandre will not come said the old princess 
 that evening they were expecting stepan arkadyevich to come down by train and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too 
 and i know why the princess went on he says that newly married couples ought to be left alone for a while at first 
 but papa has left us alone never seen him said kitty besides not newly married old married people by now 
 only if he come i shall say to you children said the princess sighing mournfully 
 what nonsense mamma both the daughters fell upon her at once how do you suppose he is feeling why now 
 and suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the voice her daughters were silent and looked at one another maman always finds something to be miserable about they said in that glance they did not know that happy as the princess was in her house and useful as she felt herself to be there she had been extremely miserable both on her own account and her ever since they had married off their last and favorite daughter and their family nest had been left empty 
 what is it agathya mikhailovna kitty asked suddenly of agathya mikhailovna who was standing with a mysterious air and a face full of meaning 
 about supper 
 well right said dolly you go and arrange about it and go and hear grisha repeat his lesson or else he will have done nothing all day 
 my duty no dolly going said levin jumping up 
 grisha who was by now at a high school had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays darya alexandrovna who had been studying latin with her son in moscow before had made it a rule on coming to the levins to go over with him at least once a day the most difficult lessons of latin and arithmetic levin had offered to take her place but the mother having once overheard lesson and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in moscow had given it said resolutely though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify levin that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done and that she had better undertake it again herself levin was amazed both at stepan arkadyevich who by neglecting his duty threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly but he promised his to give the lessons exactly as she wished and he went on teaching grisha not in his own way but by the book and so took little interest in it and often forgot the hour of the lesson so it had been today 
 no going dolly you sit still he said do it all properly according to the book only when stiva comes and we go out shooting then we shall have to miss it 
 and levin went to grisha 
 varenka was saying the same thing to kitty even in the happy household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making herself useful 
 see to the supper you sit still she said and got up to go to agathya mikhailovna 
 yes yes most likely not been able to get chickens if so our 
 agathya mikhailovna and i will see about it and varenka vanished with her 
 what a fine girl said the princess 
 not merely fine maman an exquisite girl no one else like her 
 so you are expecting stepan arkadyevich today said sergei ivanovich evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about varenka it would be difficult to find two more unlike than yours he said with a subtle smile one mobility itself only living in society like a fish in water the other our kostia lively alert quick in everything but as soon as he is in society he either sinks into apathy or struggles helplessly like a fish on land 
 yes very heedless said the princess addressing sergei ivanovich intended indeed to ask you to tell him that out of the question for her she indicated kitty to stay here that she positively must come to moscow he talks of getting a doctor down 
 maman do everything he has agreed to everything kitty said angry with her mother for appealing to sergei ivanovich to judge in such a matter 
 in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel 
 dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband when from the window of the room below where grisha was having his lesson levin leaped out and helped grisha out after him 
 stiva levin shouted from under the balcony finished dolly be afraid he added and started running like a boy to meet the carriage 
 is ea id ejus ejus ejus shouted grisha skipping along the avenue 
 and someone else too papa of course cried levin stopping at the entrance of the avenue kitty come down the steep staircase go around 
 but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince as he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside stepan arkadyevich not the prince but a handsome stout young man in a scotch cap with long ends of ribbon behind this was vassenka veslovsky a distant cousin of the shcherbatskys a brilliant young gentleman in peterburg and moscow society a capital fellow and a keen sportsman as stepan arkadyevich said introducing him 
 not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince veslovsky greeted levin gaily claiming acquaintance with him in the past and snatching up grisha into the carriage lifted him over the pointer that stepan arkadyevich had brought with him 
 levin did not get into the carriage but walked behind he was rather vexed at the nonarrival of the old prince whom he liked more and more the more he saw him and also the arrival of this vassenka veslovsky a quite alien and superfluous person he seemed to him still more alien and superfluous when on approaching the steps where the whole party children and grownups were gathered together in much animation levin saw vassenka veslovsky with a particularly warm and gallant air kissing hand 
 your wife and i are cousins and very old friends said vassenka veslovsky once more shaking hand with great warmth 
 well are there plenty of birds stepan arkadyevich said to levin hardly leaving time for everyone to exchange greetings come with the most savage intentions why maman not been in moscow since look tania something for you get it please in the carriage behind he talked in all directions how pretty grown dollenka he said to his wife once more kissing her hand holding it in one of his and patting it with the other 
 levin who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind now looked darkly at everyone and everything displeased him 
 who was it he kissed yesterday with these lips he thought looking at stepan tender demonstrations to his wife he looked at dolly and he did not like her either

 he looked at the princess who had been so dear to him a minute before and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this vassenka with his ribbons just as though she were in her own house

 during the time of the tea the grownups sat on the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened though they all especially sergei ivanovich and varenka were very well aware that there had happened an event which though negative was of very great importance they both had the same feeling rather like that of a schoolboy after an unlucky examination which has left him in the same class or shut him out of school forever everyone present also feeling that something had happened talked eagerly about extraneous subjects levin and kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening and their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable reference to those who would have liked to feel the same and could not and they felt a prick of conscience 
 mark my words alexandre will not come said the old princess 
 that evening they were expecting stepan arkadyevich to come down by train and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too 
 and i know why the princess went on he says that newly married couples ought to be left alone for a while at first 
 but papa has left us alone never seen him said kitty besides not newly married old married people by now 
 only if he come i shall say to you children said the princess sighing mournfully 
 what nonsense mamma both the daughters fell upon her at once how do you suppose he is feeling why now 
 and suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the voice her daughters were silent and looked at one another maman always finds something to be miserable about they said in that glance they did not know that happy as the princess was in her house and useful as she felt herself to be there she had been extremely miserable both on her own account and her ever since they had married off their last and favorite daughter and their family nest had been left empty 
 what is it agathya mikhailovna kitty asked suddenly of agathya mikhailovna who was standing with a mysterious air and a face full of meaning 
 about supper 
 well right said dolly you go and arrange about it and go and hear grisha repeat his lesson or else he will have done nothing all day 
 my duty no dolly going said levin jumping up 
 grisha who was by now at a high school had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays darya alexandrovna who had been studying latin with her son in moscow before had made it a rule on coming to the levins to go over with him at least once a day the most difficult lessons of latin and arithmetic levin had offered to take her place but the mother having once overheard lesson and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in moscow had given it said resolutely though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify levin that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done and that she had better undertake it again herself levin was amazed both at stepan arkadyevich who by neglecting his duty threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly but he promised his to give the lessons exactly as she wished and he went on teaching grisha not in his own way but by the book and so took little interest in it and often forgot the hour of the lesson so it had been today 
 no going dolly you sit still he said do it all properly according to the book only when stiva comes and we go out shooting then we shall have to miss it 
 and levin went to grisha 
 varenka was saying the same thing to kitty even in the happy household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making herself useful 
 see to the supper you sit still she said and got up to go to agathya mikhailovna 
 yes yes most likely not been able to get chickens if so our 
 agathya mikhailovna and i will see about it and varenka vanished with her 
 what a fine girl said the princess 
 not merely fine maman an exquisite girl no one else like her 
 so you are expecting stepan arkadyevich today said sergei ivanovich evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about varenka it would be difficult to find two more unlike than yours he said with a subtle smile one mobility itself only living in society like a fish in water the other our kostia lively alert quick in everything but as soon as he is in society he either sinks into apathy or struggles helplessly like a fish on land 
 yes very heedless said the princess addressing sergei ivanovich intended indeed to ask you to tell him that out of the question for her she indicated kitty to stay here that she positively must come to moscow he talks of getting a doctor down 
 maman do everything he has agreed to everything kitty said angry with her mother for appealing to sergei ivanovich to judge in such a matter 
 in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel 
 dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband when from the window of the room below where grisha was having his lesson levin leaped out and helped grisha out after him 
 stiva levin shouted from under the balcony finished dolly be afraid he added and started running like a boy to meet the carriage 
 is ea id ejus ejus ejus shouted grisha skipping along the avenue 
 and someone else too papa of course cried levin stopping at the entrance of the avenue kitty come down the steep staircase go around 
 but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince as he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside stepan arkadyevich not the prince but a handsome stout young man in a scotch cap with long ends of ribbon behind this was vassenka veslovsky a distant cousin of the shcherbatskys a brilliant young gentleman in peterburg and moscow society a capital fellow and a keen sportsman as stepan arkadyevich said introducing him

 chapter 
 
 levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon to supper on the stairs were standing kitty and agathya mikhailovna consulting about wines for supper 
 but why are you making all this fuss have what we usually do 
 no stiva drink kostia stop the matter kitty began hurrying after him but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and stepan arkadyevich 
 well what do you say are we going shooting tomorrow said stepan arkadyevich 
 please do go said veslovsky moving to another chair where he sat down sideways with one fat leg crossed under him 
 i shall be delighted we will go and have you had any shooting yet this year said levin to veslovsky looking intently at his leg but speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him and that was so out of keeping with him i answer for our finding double snipe but there are plenty of jacksnipe only we ought to start early not tired you tired stiva 
 me tired never been tired yet suppose we stay up all night go for a walk 
 yes really not go to bed at all capital veslovsky chimed in 
 oh we all know you can do without sleep and keep other people up too dolly said to her husband with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband but to my thinking time for bed now going i want supper 
 no do stay a little dollenka said stepan arkadyevich going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper so much still to tell you 
 nothing really i suppose 
 do you know veslovsky has been at and going to them again you know hardly seventy verstas from you and i too must certainly go over there veslovsky come here 
 vassenka crossed over to the ladies and sat down beside kitty 
 ah do tell me please you have visited her how was she darya alexandrovna appealed to him 
 levin was left at the other end of the table and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and varenka he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan arkadyevich dolly kitty and veslovsky and that was not all he saw on his face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of vassenka who was telling them something with great animation 
 exceedingly nice at their place veslovsky was telling them about vronsky and anna i of course take it upon myself to judge but in their house you feel the real feeling of home 
 what do they intend doing 
 i believe they think of going to moscow for the winter 
 how jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together when are you going there stepan arkadyevich asked vassenka 
 spending july there 
 will you go stepan arkadyevich said to his wife 
 been wanting to a long while i shall certainly go said dolly i am sorry for her and i know her a splendid woman i will go alone when you go back and then i shall be in no way and it will be better indeed without you 
 to be sure said stepan arkadyevich and you kitty 
 i why should i go kitty said flushing all over and she glanced round at her husband 
 do you know anna arkadyevna then veslovsky asked her a very fascinating woman 
 yes she answered veslovsky crimsoning still more she got up and walked across to her husband 
 are you going shooting then tomorrow she said 
 his jealousy had in these few moments especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to veslovsky gone far indeed now as he heard her words he construed them in his own fashion strange as it was to him afterward to recall it it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka veslovsky with whom as he fancied she was in love 
 yes going he answered her in an unnatural voice disagreeable to himself 
 no better spend the day here tomorrow or dolly see anything of her husband and set off the day after said kitty 
 the motive of words was interpreted by levin thus separate me from him i care about your going but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man 
 oh if you wish stay here tomorrow levin answered with peculiar amiability 
 vassenka meanwhile utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned got up from the table after kitty and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes he followed her 
 levin saw that look he turned white and for a minute he could hardly breathe how dare he look at my wife like that was the feeling that boiled within him 
 tomorrow then do please let us go said vassenka sitting down on a chair and again crossing his leg as his habit was 
 jealousy went further still already he saw himself a deceived husband looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life but in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of vassenka about his shooting his gun and his boots and agreed to go shooting next day 
 happily for levin the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising kitty to go to bed but even at this point levin could not escape another agony as he said good night to his hostess vassenka would again have kissed her hand but kitty reddening drew back her hand and said with a bluntness for which the old princess scolded her afterward 
 we like that fashion 
 in eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them 
 why how can one want to go to bed said stepan arkadyevich who after drinking several glasses of wine at supper was now in his most charming and lyrical humor look kitty he said pointing to the moon which had just risen behind the linden trees how exquisite veslovsky this is the time for a serenade you know he has a splendid voice we practised songs together along the road he has brought some lovely songs with him two new ones varvara andreevna and he must sing some duets 
 when the party had broken up stepan arkadyevich walked a long while about the avenue with veslovsky their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs 
 levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy chair in his bedroom and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong but when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question was there perhaps something you disliked about veslovsky it all burst out and he told her all he was hurt himself by what he was saying and that exasperated him all the more 
 he stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in the expression of his face would have been grim and even cruel if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her his jaws were twitching and his voice kept breaking 
 you must understand that not jealous a nasty word i be jealous and believe that i say what i feel but this is awful not jealous but wounded humiliated that anybody dare think that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that

 levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon to supper on the stairs were standing kitty and agathya mikhailovna consulting about wines for supper 
 but why are you making all this fuss have what we usually do 
 no stiva drink kostia stop the matter kitty began hurrying after him but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and stepan arkadyevich 
 well what do you say are we going shooting tomorrow said stepan arkadyevich 
 please do go said veslovsky moving to another chair where he sat down sideways with one fat leg crossed under him 
 i shall be delighted we will go and have you had any shooting yet this year said levin to veslovsky looking intently at his leg but speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him and that was so out of keeping with him i answer for our finding double snipe but there are plenty of jacksnipe only we ought to start early not tired you tired stiva 
 me tired never been tired yet suppose we stay up all night go for a walk 
 yes really not go to bed at all capital veslovsky chimed in 
 oh we all know you can do without sleep and keep other people up too dolly said to her husband with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband but to my thinking time for bed now going i want supper 
 no do stay a little dollenka said stepan arkadyevich going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper so much still to tell you 
 nothing really i suppose 
 do you know veslovsky has been at and going to them again you know hardly seventy verstas from you and i too must certainly go over there veslovsky come here 
 vassenka crossed over to the ladies and sat down beside kitty 
 ah do tell me please you have visited her how was she darya alexandrovna appealed to him 
 levin was left at the other end of the table and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and varenka he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between stepan arkadyevich dolly kitty and veslovsky and that was not all he saw on his face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of vassenka who was telling them something with great animation 
 exceedingly nice at their place veslovsky was telling them about vronsky and anna i of course take it upon myself to judge but in their house you feel the real feeling of home 
 what do they intend doing 
 i believe they think of going to moscow for the winter 
 how jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together when are you going there stepan arkadyevich asked vassenka 
 spending july there 
 will you go stepan arkadyevich said to his wife 
 been wanting to a long while i shall certainly go said dolly i am sorry for her and i know her a splendid woman i will go alone when you go back and then i shall be in no way and it will be better indeed without you 
 to be sure said stepan arkadyevich and you kitty 
 i why should i go kitty said flushing all over and she glanced round at her husband 
 do you know anna arkadyevna then veslovsky asked her a very fascinating woman 
 yes she answered veslovsky crimsoning still more she got up and walked across to her husband 
 are you going shooting then tomorrow she said 
 his jealousy had in these few moments especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to veslovsky gone far indeed now as he heard her words he construed them in his own fashion strange as it was to him afterward to recall it it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to vassenka veslovsky with whom as he fancied she was in love 
 yes going he answered her in an unnatural voice disagreeable to himself 
 no better spend the day here tomorrow or dolly see anything of her husband and set off the day after said kitty 
 the motive of words was interpreted by levin thus separate me from him i care about your going but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man 
 oh if you wish stay here tomorrow levin answered with peculiar amiability 
 vassenka meanwhile utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned got up from the table after kitty and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes he followed her 
 levin saw that look he turned white and for a minute he could hardly breathe how dare he look at my wife like that was the feeling that boiled within him 
 tomorrow then do please let us go said vassenka sitting down on a chair and again crossing his leg as his habit was 
 jealousy went further still already he saw himself a deceived husband looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life but in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of vassenka about his shooting his gun and his boots and agreed to go shooting next day 
 happily for levin the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising kitty to go to bed but even at this point levin could not escape another agony as he said good night to his hostess vassenka would again have kissed her hand but kitty reddening drew back her hand and said with a bluntness for which the old princess scolded her afterward 
 we like that fashion 
 in eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them 
 why how can one want to go to bed said stepan arkadyevich who after drinking several glasses of wine at supper was now in his most charming and lyrical humor look kitty he said pointing to the moon which had just risen behind the linden trees how exquisite veslovsky this is the time for a serenade you know he has a splendid voice we practised songs together along the road he has brought some lovely songs with him two new ones varvara andreevna and he must sing some duets 
 when the party had broken up stepan arkadyevich walked a long while about the avenue with veslovsky their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs 
 levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy chair in his bedroom and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong but when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question was there perhaps something you disliked about veslovsky it all burst out and he told her all he was hurt himself by what he was saying and that exasperated him all the more 
 he stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in the expression of his face would have been grim and even cruel if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her his jaws were twitching and his voice kept breaking 
 you must understand that not jealous a nasty word i be jealous and believe that i say what i feel but this is awful not jealous but wounded humiliated that anybody dare think that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that 
 eyes like what said kitty trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them

 chapter 
 
 next day before the ladies were up the carriages for the shooting party the droshky and a trap were at the door and laska aware since early morning that they were going shooting after much whining and darting to and fro had sat herself down in the droshky beside the coachman and disapproving of the delay was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not issue the first to come out was vassenka veslovsky in new high boots that reached halfway up his thick thighs in a green blouse with a new cartridge belt redolent of leather and in his scotch cap with ribbons with a english gun without a sling laska flew up to him welcomed him and jumping up asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon but getting no answer from him she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again her head on one side and one ear pricked up to listen at last the door opened with a creak and stepan pointer krak flew out running round and round and turning over in the air stepan arkadyevich himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth soho soho krak he cried encouragingly to the dog who put his paws up on his chest catching at his gamebag stepan arkadyevich was dressed in brogues and puttees in torn trousers and a short coat on his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem and his gamebag and cartridge belt though worn were of the very best quality 
 vassenka veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatters but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality he saw it now as he looked at stepan arkadyevich radiant in his rags graceful and joyous a typical russian nobleman and he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same getup 
 well and what about our host he asked 
 a young wife said stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 yes and such a charming one 
 he came down dressed no doubt run up to her again 
 stepan arkadyevich guessed right levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg her in name to be more careful the great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute jostle against her then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days and to beg her to be sure to send a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write him if it were but two words only to let him know that all was well with her 
 kitty was distressed as she always was at parting for a couple of days from her husband but when she saw his eager figure looking big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and said to him cheerfully 
 pardon gentlemen he said running out on the steps have you put the lunch in why is the chestnut on the right well it matter laska down go and lie down 
 put them with the herd of heifers he said to the herdsman who was waiting for him at the steps to ask him what was to be done with the geld oxen excuse me here comes another villain 
 levin jumped out of the droshky in which he had already taken his seat to meet the carpenter who came toward the steps with a rule in his hand 
 you come to the countinghouse yesterday and now detaining me well what is it 
 would your honor let me make another turning only three steps to add and we make it just fit at the same time it will be much more convenient 
 you should have listened to me levin answered with annoyance i said put the lines and then fit in the steps now no setting it right do as i told you and make a new staircase 
 the point was that in the wing that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place now the carpenter wanted to keep the same staircase by adding three steps 
 it will be much better 
 but your staircase coming out with its three steps 
 why upon my word sir the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile it comes out right at the very spot it starts here he said with a persuasive gesture then go up and go up and come out 
 but three steps will add to the length too where is it to come out 
 why to be sure go up and come out the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly 
 reach the ceiling and the wall 
 upon my word why go up and go up and come out like this 
 levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust 
 there do you see 
 as your honor likes said the carpenter with a sudden gleam in his eyes obviously understanding the thing at last it seems be best to make a new one 
 well then do it as told levin shouted seating himself in the droshky down hold the dogs philip 
 levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk besides that he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action if he had anything on his mind at that moment it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the kolpensky marsh whether laska would show to advantage in comparison with krak and whether he would shoot well that day himself not to disgrace himself before a new spectator not to be outdone by oblonsky that too was a thought that crossed his brain 
 oblonsky was feeling the same and he too was not talkative vassenka veslovsky alone kept up a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter as he listened to him now levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before vassenka was really a fine fellow simple goodhearted and very if levin had met him before he was married he would have made friends with him levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance it was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed because he had long nails and a stylish cap and everything else to correspond but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding levin liked him for his good education for speaking french and english with such an excellent accent and for being a man of his world 
 vassenka was extremely delighted with the left outrigger a horse of the don steppes he kept praising him enthusiastically how fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse eh it he said he had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic and it turned out nothing of the sort but his simplicity particularly in conjunction with his good looks his amiable smile and the grace of his movements was very attractive either because his nature was sympathetic to levin or because levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him at any rate he liked his society 
 after they had driven three verstas from home veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table in the pocketbook there were three hundred and seventy roubles and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty 
 do you know what levin gallop home on that outrigger that will be splendid eh he said preparing to get out 
 no why should you answered levin calculating that vassenka could hardly weigh less than six poods send the coachman 
 the coachman rode back on the outrigger and levin himself drove the remaining pair

 next day before the ladies were up the carriages for the shooting party the droshky and a trap were at the door and laska aware since early morning that they were going shooting after much whining and darting to and fro had sat herself down in the droshky beside the coachman and disapproving of the delay was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not issue the first to come out was vassenka veslovsky in new high boots that reached halfway up his thick thighs in a green blouse with a new cartridge belt redolent of leather and in his scotch cap with ribbons with a english gun without a sling laska flew up to him welcomed him and jumping up asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon but getting no answer from him she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again her head on one side and one ear pricked up to listen at last the door opened with a creak and stepan pointer krak flew out running round and round and turning over in the air stepan arkadyevich himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth soho soho krak he cried encouragingly to the dog who put his paws up on his chest catching at his gamebag stepan arkadyevich was dressed in brogues and puttees in torn trousers and a short coat on his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem and his gamebag and cartridge belt though worn were of the very best quality 
 vassenka veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatters but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality he saw it now as he looked at stepan arkadyevich radiant in his rags graceful and joyous a typical russian nobleman and he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same getup

 yes and such a charming one 
 he came down dressed no doubt run up to her again 
 stepan arkadyevich guessed right levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday and moreover to beg her in name to be more careful the great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute jostle against her then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days and to beg her to be sure to send a note next morning by a servant on horseback to write him if it were but two words only to let him know that all was well with her 
 kitty was distressed as she always was at parting for a couple of days from her husband but when she saw his eager figure looking big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure and said to him cheerfully

 chapter 
 
 well now our plan of campaign tell us all about it said stepan arkadyevich 
 our plan is this now driving to gvozdiov in gvozdiov a double snipe marsh on this side and beyond gvozdiov come some magnificent jacksnipe marshes where there are double snipe too hot now and get there twenty verstas toward evening and have some evening shooting spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors 
 and is there nothing on the way 
 yes but save ourselves besides hot there are two good little places but i doubt there being anything to shoot 
 levin would himself have liked to go into these little places but they were near home he could shoot them over any time and they were only little places there would hardly be room for three to shoot and so with some insincerity he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot when they reached a little marsh levin would have driven by but stepan arkadyevich with the experienced eye of a sportsman at once detected a soggy spot visible from the road 
 we try that he said pointing to the little marsh 
 levin do please how delightful vassenka veslovsky began begging and levin could not but consent 
 before they had time to stop the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh 
 krak laska 
 the dogs came back 
 there be room for three stay here said levin hoping they would find nothing but pewits which had been startled by the dogs and turning over in their flight were plaintively wailing over the marsh 
 no come along levin go together veslovsky called 
 really no room laska back laska you want another dog will you 
 levin remained with the droshky and looked enviously at the sportsmen they walked across the marsh except one moor hen and pewits of which vassenka killed one there was nothing in the marsh 
 come you see now that it was not that i grudged the marsh said levin only wasting time 
 oh no it was jolly all the same did you see us said vassenka veslovsky clambering awkwardly into the droshky with his gun and his pewit in his hands how splendidly i shot this bird i well shall we soon be getting to the real place 
 the horses started off suddenly levin knocked his head against the stock of gun and there was the report of a shot the gun did actually go off first but that was how it seemed to levin it appeared that vassenka veslovsky making the cocks safe had pressed one trigger and had held back the other cock the charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone stepan arkadyevich shook his head and laughed reprovingly at veslovsky but levin had not the heart to reprove him in the first place any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on forehead and besides veslovsky was at first so distressed and then laughed so and infectiously at their general dismay that one could not but laugh with him 
 when they reached the second marsh which was fairly large and would inevitably take some time to shoot over levin tried to persuade them to pass it by but veslovsky again talked him over again as the marsh was narrow levin like a good host remained with the carriages 
 krak made straight for hummocks vassenka veslovsky was the first to run after the dog before stepan arkadyevich had time to come up a double snipe flew out veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow this double snipe was left for veslovsky to follow up krak found it again and pointed and veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriages 
 now you go and stay with the horses he said 
 levin had begun to feel the pangs of a envy he handed the reins to veslovsky and walked into the marsh 
 laska who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment flew straight ahead to an unfailing place covered with mossy hummocks that levin knew well and that krak had not yet come upon 
 why you stop her shouted stepan arkadyevich 
 she scare them answered levin sympathizing with his pleasure and hurrying after her 
 as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar hummocks there was more and more earnestness in exploration a little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant she made one circuit round the hummocks was beginning a second and suddenly quivered with excitement and stood 
 come come stiva shouted levin feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears all sounds confused but loud began to beat on his hearing losing all sense of distance he heard the steps of stepan arkadyevich mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance he heard the brittle sound of the tussock which came off with its roots when he had trodden on a hummock and he took this sound for the flight of a double snipe he heard too not far behind him a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself 
 picking his steps he moved up to the dog 
 fetch it 
 not a double but a jacksnipe flew up from beside the dog levin had lifted his gun but at the very instant when he was taking aim the sound of splashing grew louder came closer and was joined with the sound of voice shouting something with strange loudness levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe but still he fired 
 when he had made sure he had missed levin looked round and saw the horses and the droshky not on the road but in the marsh 
 veslovsky eager to see the shooting had driven into the marsh and got the horses stuck in the mud 
 damn the fellow levin said to himself as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire what did you drive in for he said to him dryly and calling the coachman he began pulling the horses out 
 levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevich nor veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing without answering a syllable to protestations that it had been quite dry there levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses but then as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously veslovsky was tugging at the droshky by one of the splashboards so that he broke it indeed levin blamed himself for having under the influence of feelings been too cold to veslovsky and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything had been put right and the vehicles had been brought back to the road levin had the lunch served 
 bon apptit bonne conscience ce poulet va tomber fond de mes bottes vassenka who had recovered his spirits quoted the french saying as he finished his second chicken well now our troubles are over now going to go well only to atone for my sins bound to sit on the box so eh no no be your automedon you shall see how get you along he answered without letting go the rein when levin begged him to let the coachman drive no i must atone for my sins and very comfortable on the box and he drove 
 levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses especially the left of them the chestnut whom he did not know how to hold in but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the english fashion and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the gvozdiov marsh

 really no room laska back laska you want another dog will you 
 levin remained with the droshky and looked enviously at the sportsmen they walked across the marsh except one moor hen and pewits of which vassenka killed one there was nothing in the marsh 
 come you see now that it was not that i grudged the marsh said levin only wasting time 
 oh no it was jolly all the same did you see us said vassenka veslovsky clambering awkwardly into the droshky with his gun and his pewit in his hands how splendidly i shot this bird i well shall we soon be getting to the real place 
 the horses started off suddenly levin knocked his head against the stock of gun and there was the report of a shot the gun did actually go off first but that was how it seemed to levin it appeared that vassenka veslovsky making the cocks safe had pressed one trigger and had held back the other cock the charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone stepan arkadyevich shook his head and laughed reprovingly at veslovsky but levin had not the heart to reprove him in the first place any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on forehead and besides veslovsky was at first so distressed and then laughed so and infectiously at their general dismay that one could not but laugh with him 
 when they reached the second marsh which was fairly large and would inevitably take some time to shoot over levin tried to persuade them to pass it by but veslovsky again talked him over again as the marsh was narrow levin like a good host remained with the carriages 
 krak made straight for hummocks vassenka veslovsky was the first to run after the dog before stepan arkadyevich had time to come up a double snipe flew out veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow this double snipe was left for veslovsky to follow up krak found it again and pointed and veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriages 
 now you go and stay with the horses he said 
 levin had begun to feel the pangs of a envy he handed the reins to veslovsky and walked into the marsh 
 laska who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment flew straight ahead to an unfailing place covered with mossy hummocks that levin knew well and that krak had not yet come upon 
 why you stop her shouted stepan arkadyevich 
 she scare them answered levin sympathizing with his pleasure and hurrying after her 
 as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar hummocks there was more and more earnestness in exploration a little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant she made one circuit round the hummocks was beginning a second and suddenly quivered with excitement and stood 
 come come stiva shouted levin feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently and all of a sudden as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears all sounds confused but loud began to beat on his hearing losing all sense of distance he heard the steps of stepan arkadyevich mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance he heard the brittle sound of the tussock which came off with its roots when he had trodden on a hummock and he took this sound for the flight of a double snipe he heard too not far behind him a splashing in the water which he could not explain to himself 
 picking his steps he moved up to the dog 
 fetch it 
 not a double but a jacksnipe flew up from beside the dog levin had lifted his gun but at the very instant when he was taking aim the sound of splashing grew louder came closer and was joined with the sound of voice shouting something with strange loudness levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe but still he fired 
 when he had made sure he had missed levin looked round and saw the horses and the droshky not on the road but in the marsh 
 veslovsky eager to see the shooting had driven into the marsh and got the horses stuck in the mud 
 damn the fellow levin said to himself as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire what did you drive in for he said to him dryly and calling the coachman he began pulling the horses out 
 levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud and still more at the fact that neither stepan arkadyevich nor veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing without answering a syllable to protestations that it had been quite dry there levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses but then as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously veslovsky was tugging at the droshky by one of the splashboards so that he broke it indeed levin blamed himself for having under the influence of feelings been too cold to veslovsky and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness when everything had been put right and the vehicles had been brought back to the road levin had the lunch served

 chapter 
 
 vassenka drove the horses so fast that they reached the marsh too early while it was still hot 
 as they drew near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help considering how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movements stepan arkadyevich evidently had the same desire and on his face levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting together with a certain slyness peculiar to him 
 how shall we go a splendid marsh i see and there are hawks said stepan arkadyevich pointing to two great birds hovering over the sedge where there are hawks there is sure to be game 
 now gentlemen said levin pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with a somewhat somber expression do you see that sedge he pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river the marsh begins here straight in front of us do you see where it is greener from here it runs to the right where the horses are there are hummocks there and double snipe and all round that sedge as far as that alder tree and right up to the mill over there do you see where the creek is the best place there i once shot seventeen jacksnipe separate with the dogs and go in different directions and then meet over there at the mill 
 well go left and who to the right asked stepan arkadyevich wider to the right you two go that way and take the left he said with apparent carelessness 
 capital make the bigger bag yes come along come along vassenka exclaimed 
 levin could do nothing but agree and they divided 
 as soon as they entered the marsh the two dogs began hunting about together and made toward the spot levin knew method wary and indefinite he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe 
 veslovsky walk beside me beside me he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh 
 oh i get in your way trouble about me 
 but levin could not help troubling and recalled words at parting mind you shoot one another the dogs came nearer and nearer passed each other each pursuing its own scent the expectation of snipe was so intense that to levin the smacking sound of his own heel as he drew it up out of the rusty mire seemed to be the call of a snipe and he clutched and pressed the butt of his gun 
 bang bang sounded almost in his ear vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment toward the sportsmen far out of range before levin had time to look round there was the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rose one after another 
 stepan arkadyevich hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements and the snipe fell as a clod into the quagmire oblonsky aimed deliberately at another still flying low toward the sedge and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fell and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut its unhurt wing showing white beneath 
 levin was not so lucky he aimed at his first bird too low and missed he aimed at it again just as it was rising but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet distracting him so that he missed again 
 while they were reloading their guns another snipe rose and veslovsky who had had time to reload again sent two charges of small shot into the water stepan arkadyevich picked up his snipe and with sparkling eyes looked at levin 
 well now let us separate said stepan arkadyevich and limping on his left foot holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog he walked off in one direction levin and veslovsky walked off in the other 
 it always happened with levin that when his first shots were a failure he got heated and out of temper and shot badly the whole day so was it that day the snipe showed themselves in numbers they kept flying up from just under the dogs from under the legs and levin might have retrieved his ill luck but the more he shot the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of veslovsky who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately killing nothing and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success levin in feverish haste could not restrain himself got more and more out of temper and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting laska indeed seemed to understand this she began searching more listlessly and gazed back at the sportsmen with apparent perplexity or reproach in her eyes shots followed shots in rapid succession the smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen while in the great roomy net of the gamebag there were only three light small snipe and of these one had been killed by veslovsky alone and one by both of them together meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of stepan shots not frequent but as levin fancied well directed for almost after each they heard krak krak apporte 
 this excited levin still more the snipe were floating continually in the air over the sedge their whirring wings close to the earth and their harsh cries high in the air could be heard on all sides the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air settled again before the sportsmen instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh 
 after walking through the larger half of the marsh levin and veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing grass was divided into long strips reaching to the sedge marked off in one place by the trampled grass in another by a path mown through it half of these strips had already been mown 
 though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part levin had promised stepan arkadyevich to meet him and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches 
 hi hunters shouted one of a group of peasants sitting on an unharnessed telega come and have some lunch with us have a drop of wine 
 levin looked round 
 come along all right shouted a bearded peasant with a red face showing his white teeth in a grin and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight 
 disent asked veslovsky 
 they invite you to have some vodka most likely been dividing the meadow into lots i should have some said levin not without some guile hoping veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka and would go off to them 
 why do they offer it 
 oh merrymaking really you should join them you would be interested 
 allons curieux 
 you go you go find the way to the mill cried levin and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that veslovsky bent and stumbling with weariness holding his gun out at length was making his way out of the marsh toward the peasants 
 you come too the peasant shouted to levin never fear taste our pie 
 levin felt a strong inclination for a drink of vodka and a bite of bread he was exhausted and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire and for a minute he hesitated but laska was pointing and immediately all his weariness vanished and he walked lightly through the swamp toward the dog a snipe flew up at his feet he fired and killed it laska still pointed fetch it another bird flew up close to the dog levin fired but it was an unlucky day for him he missed it and when he went to look for the one he had shot he could not find that either he wandered all about the sedge but laska did not believe he had shot it and when he sent her to find it she pretended to hunt for it but did not really do so 
 and in the absence of vassenka on whom levin threw the blame of his failure things went no better there was plenty of snipe still but levin made one miss after another 
 the slanting rays of the sun were still hot his clothes soaked through with perspiration stuck to his body his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squelched at every step the sweat ran in drops down his face his mouth was full of a bitter taste his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe he could not touch the barrel of his gun it was so hot his heart beat with short rapid throbs his hands shook with excitement and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hummocks and in the swamp but still he walked on and still he shot at last after a disgraceful miss he flung his gun and his hat on the ground 
 no i must control myself he said to himself picking up his gun and his hat he called laska and went out of the swamp when he got onto dry ground he sat down on a hummock pulled off his boot and emptied it then walked to the marsh drank some water moistened the burning hot barrel of his gun and washed his face and hands feeling refreshed he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled firmly resolved to keep cool 
 he tried to be calm but it was the same again his finger pressed the trigger before he had taken a good aim at the bird it got worse and worse 
 he had only five birds in his gamebag when he walked out of the marsh toward the alders where he was to rejoin stepan arkadyevich 
 before he caught sight of stepan arkadyevich he saw his dog krak black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder and with the air of a conqueror sniffed laska behind krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevich he came to meet him red and perspiring with unbuttoned neckband still limping in the same way 
 well you have been popping away he said smiling 
 how have you got on queried levin but there was no need to ask for he had already seen the full gamebag 
 oh pretty fair 
 he had fourteen birds 
 a splendid marsh no doubt veslovsky got in your way awkward too shooting with one dog said stepan arkadyevich to soften his triumph

 this excited levin still more the snipe were floating continually in the air over the sedge their whirring wings close to the earth and their harsh cries high in the air could be heard on all sides the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air settled again before the sportsmen instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh 
 after walking through the larger half of the marsh levin and veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing grass was divided into long strips reaching to the sedge marked off in one place by the trampled grass in another by a path mown through it half of these strips had already been mown 
 though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part levin had promised stepan arkadyevich to meet him and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches 
 hi hunters shouted one of a group of peasants sitting on an unharnessed telega come and have some lunch with us have a drop of wine 
 levin looked round 
 come along all right shouted a bearded peasant with a red face showing his white teeth in a grin and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight 
 disent asked veslovsky 
 they invite you to have some vodka most likely been dividing the meadow into lots i should have some said levin not without some guile hoping veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka and would go off to them 
 why do they offer it 
 oh merrymaking really you should join them you would be interested 
 allons curieux 
 you go you go find the way to the mill cried levin and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that veslovsky bent and stumbling with weariness holding his gun out at length was making his way out of the marsh toward the peasants 
 you come too the peasant shouted to levin never fear taste our pie 
 levin felt a strong inclination for a drink of vodka and a bite of bread he was exhausted and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire and for a minute he hesitated but laska was pointing and immediately all his weariness vanished and he walked lightly through the swamp toward the dog a snipe flew up at his feet he fired and killed it laska still pointed fetch it another bird flew up close to the dog levin fired but it was an unlucky day for him he missed it and when he went to look for the one he had shot he could not find that either he wandered all about the sedge but laska did not believe he had shot it and when he sent her to find it she pretended to hunt for it but did not really do so 
 and in the absence of vassenka on whom levin threw the blame of his failure things went no better there was plenty of snipe still but levin made one miss after another 
 the slanting rays of the sun were still hot his clothes soaked through with perspiration stuck to his body his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squelched at every step the sweat ran in drops down his face his mouth was full of a bitter taste his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe he could not touch the barrel of his gun it was so hot his heart beat with short rapid throbs his hands shook with excitement and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hummocks and in the swamp but still he walked on and still he shot at last after a disgraceful miss he flung his gun and his hat on the ground 
 no i must control myself he said to himself picking up his gun and his hat he called laska and went out of the swamp when he got onto dry ground he sat down on a hummock pulled off his boot and emptied it then walked to the marsh drank some water moistened the burning hot barrel of his gun and washed his face and hands feeling refreshed he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled firmly resolved to keep cool 
 he tried to be calm but it was the same again his finger pressed the trigger before he had taken a good aim at the bird it got worse and worse 
 he had only five birds in his gamebag when he walked out of the marsh toward the alders where he was to rejoin stepan arkadyevich 
 before he caught sight of stepan arkadyevich he saw his dog krak black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder and with the air of a conqueror sniffed laska behind krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of stepan arkadyevich he came to meet him red and perspiring with unbuttoned neckband still limping in the same way 
 well you have been popping away he said smiling 
 how have you got on queried levin but there was no need to ask for he had already seen the full gamebag 
 oh pretty fair 
 he had fourteen birds 
 a splendid marsh no doubt veslovsky got in your way awkward too shooting with one dog said stepan arkadyevich to soften his triumph

 vassenka drove the horses so fast that they reached the marsh too early while it was still hot 
 as they drew near this more important marsh the chief aim of their expedition levin could not help considering how he could get rid of vassenka and be free in his movements stepan arkadyevich evidently had the same desire and on his face levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting together with a certain slyness peculiar to him 
 how shall we go a splendid marsh i see and there are hawks said stepan arkadyevich pointing to two great birds hovering over the sedge where there are hawks there is sure to be game 
 now gentlemen said levin pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with a somewhat somber expression do you see that sedge he pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river the marsh begins here straight in front of us do you see where it is greener from here it runs to the right where the horses are there are hummocks there and double snipe and all round that sedge as far as that alder tree and right up to the mill over there do you see where the creek is the best place there i once shot seventeen jacksnipe separate with the dogs and go in different directions and then meet over there at the mill 
 well go left and who to the right asked stepan arkadyevich wider to the right you two go that way and take the left he said with apparent carelessness 
 capital make the bigger bag yes come along come along vassenka exclaimed 
 levin could do nothing but agree and they divided 
 as soon as they entered the marsh the two dogs began hunting about together and made toward the spot levin knew method wary and indefinite he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe 
 veslovsky walk beside me beside me he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed after that casual shot near the kolpensky marsh 
 oh i get in your way trouble about me 
 but levin could not help troubling and recalled words at parting mind you shoot one another the dogs came nearer and nearer passed each other each pursuing its own scent the expectation of snipe was so intense that to levin the smacking sound of his own heel as he drew it up out of the rusty mire seemed to be the call of a snipe and he clutched and pressed the butt of his gun 
 bang bang sounded almost in his ear vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment toward the sportsmen far out of range before levin had time to look round there was the whir of one snipe another a third and some eight more rose one after another 
 stepan arkadyevich hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements and the snipe fell as a clod into the quagmire oblonsky aimed deliberately at another still flying low toward the sedge and together with the report of the shot that snipe too fell and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut its unhurt wing showing white beneath 
 levin was not so lucky he aimed at his first bird too low and missed he aimed at it again just as it was rising but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet distracting him so that he missed again 
 while they were reloading their guns another snipe rose and veslovsky who had had time to reload again sent two charges of small shot into the water stepan arkadyevich picked up his snipe and with sparkling eyes looked at levin 
 well now let us separate said stepan arkadyevich and limping on his left foot holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog he walked off in one direction levin and veslovsky walked off in the other 
 it always happened with levin that when his first shots were a failure he got heated and out of temper and shot badly the whole day so was it that day the snipe showed themselves in numbers they kept flying up from just under the dogs from under the legs and levin might have retrieved his ill luck but the more he shot the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of veslovsky who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately killing nothing and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success levin in feverish haste could not restrain himself got more and more out of temper and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting laska indeed seemed to understand this she began searching more listlessly and gazed back at the sportsmen with apparent perplexity or reproach in her eyes shots followed shots in rapid succession the smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen while in the great roomy net of the gamebag there were only three light small snipe and of these one had been killed by veslovsky alone and one by both of them together meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of stepan shots not frequent but as levin fancied well directed for almost after each they heard krak krak apporte

 chapter 
 
 when levin and stepan arkadyevich reached the hut where levin always used to stay veslovsky was already there he was sitting in the middle of the hut clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier the brother of the wife who was helping him off with his miry boots veslovsky was laughing his infectious laugh 
 only just come ils ont t charmants just fancy they gave me drink and fed me such bread it was exquisite dlicieux and the vodka i never tasted any better and they would not take a penny for anything and they kept saying excuse our homely ways 
 what should they take anything for they were entertaining you to be sure do you suppose they keep vodka for sale said the soldier succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off together with the blackened stocking 
 in spite of the dirtiness of the hut which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean and the smells of the marsh and the powder that filled the room and the absence of knives and forks the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen washed and clean they went into a hay barn swept ready for them where the coachmen had been making up beds for the gentlemen 
 though it was dusk not one of them wanted to go to sleep 
 after wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns of dogs and of former shooting parties the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them after vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay this delightful broken telega he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out of the good nature of the peasants who had treated him to vodka of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at where he had stayed the previous summer malthus was a capitalist who had made his money by speculation in railway shares stepan arkadyevich described what snipe moors this malthus had taken on lease in the tver province and how they were preserved and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh 
 i understand you said levin sitting up in the hay how is it such people disgust you i can understand a lunch with lafitte is all very pleasant but you dislike just that very sumptuousness all these people just like our tax farmers in the old days get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone they care for their contempt and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved 
 perfectly true chimed in vassenka veslovsky perfectly oblonsky of course goes out of bonhomie but other people say well oblonsky stays with them 
 not a bit of it levin could hear that oblonsky was smiling as he spoke i simply consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman all made their money alike by their work and their intelligence 
 oh by what work do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them 
 of course work work in this sense that if it were not for him and others like him there would have been no railways 
 but not work like the work of a peasant or in a learned profession 
 granted but work in the sense that his activity produces a result the railways but of course you think the railways useless 
 no another question i am disposed to admit that useful but all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest 
 but who is to define what is proportionate 
 making profit by dishonest means by trickery said levin conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty such as banking for instance he went on an evil the amassing of huge fortunes without labor just the same thing as with the tax farmers only the form changed le roi est mort vive le roi no sooner were the tax farmers abolished than the railways came up and banking companies that too is profit without work 
 yes that may all be very true and clever lie down krak stepan arkadyevich called to his dog who was scratching and turning over all the hay he was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position and so talked serenely and without haste but you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work that i receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk though he knows more about the work than i do dishonest i suppose 
 i say 
 well but i can tell you your receiving some five thousand say for your work on the land while our host the peasant here however hard he works can never get more than fifty roubles is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk and malthus getting more than a railway expert no quite the contrary i see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people which is utterly baseless and i fancy envy at the bottom of it 
 no unfair said veslovsky how could envy come in there is something unclean about that sort of business 
 you say levin went on that unjust for me to receive five thousand while the peasant has fifty roubles true it is unfair and i feel it but 
 it really is why is it we spend our time riding drinking shooting doing nothing while they are forever at work said vassenka veslovsky obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity 
 yes you feel it but you give him your property said stepan arkadyevich intentionally as it seemed provoking levin 
 there had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two as though since they had married sisters a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation as it began to take a personal note 
 i give it away because no one demands that from me and if i wanted to i could not give it away answered levin and have no one to give it to 
 give it to this peasant he would not refuse it 
 yes but how am i to give it up am i to go to him and make a title deed 
 i know but if you are convinced that you have no right 
 not at all convinced on the contrary i feel have no right to give it up that i have duties both to the land and to my family 
 no excuse me but if you consider this inequality is unjust why is it you act accordingly 
 well i do act negatively on that idea so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me 
 no excuse me a paradox 
 yes something of a sophistry about that veslovsky agreed ah our host he said to the peasant who came into the barn opening the creaking door how is it not asleep yet 
 no one to sleep i thought our gentlemen would be asleep but i heard them chattering i want to get a hook from here she bite he added stepping cautiously with his bare feet 
 and where are you going to sleep 
 we are going out for night watching 
 ah what a night said veslovsky looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed droshky that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors but listen there are voices singing and on my word not badly too that singing my friend 
 the housemaids from hard by here 
 go take a walk we go to sleep you know oblonsky come along 
 if one could only do both lie here and go answered oblonsky stretching capital lying here 
 well i shall go by myself said veslovsky getting up eagerly and putting on his boots and stockings gentlemen if fun fetch you treated me to some good sport and i forget you 
 he really is a capital fellow he said stepan arkadyevich when veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him 
 yes capital answered levin still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before it seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity and yet both of them straightforward men and not fools had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries this disconcerted him 
 just this my dear boy one must do one of two things either admit that the existing order of society is just and then stick up for rights in it or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges as i do and then enjoy them and be satisfied 
 no if it were unjust you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied at least i could not the great thing for me is to feel that not to blame 
 what do you say why not go after all said stepan arkadyevich evidently weary of the strain of thought we go to sleep you know come go 
 levin did not answer what they had said in the conversation that he acted justly only in a negative sense absorbed his thoughts can it be that only possible to be just negatively he was asking himself 
 how strong the smell of the fresh hay is though said stepan arkadyevich getting up not a chance of sleeping vassenka has been getting up some fun there do you hear the laughter and his voice we better go come along 
 no not coming answered levin 
 surely not a matter of principle too said stepan arkadyevich smiling as he felt about in the dark for his cap 
 not a matter of principle but why should i go 
 but do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself said stepan arkadyevich finding his cap and getting up 
 how so 
 do you suppose i see the line taken up with your wife i heard how a question of the greatest consequence whether or not to be away for a couple of days shooting all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that answer a man must be independent he has his masculine interests a man has to be manly said oblonsky opening the door 
 in what way to go running after servant girls said levin 
 why not if it amuses him a ne tire pas consequence it do my wife any harm and amuse me the great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home there should be nothing in the home but tie your own hands 
 perhaps so said levin dryly and he turned on his side tomorrow early i want to go shooting and i wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak

 when levin and stepan arkadyevich reached the hut where levin always used to stay veslovsky was already there he was sitting in the middle of the hut clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier the brother of the wife who was helping him off with his miry boots veslovsky was laughing his infectious laugh 
 only just come ils ont t charmants just fancy they gave me drink and fed me such bread it was exquisite dlicieux and the vodka i never tasted any better and they would not take a penny for anything and they kept saying excuse our homely ways 
 what should they take anything for they were entertaining you to be sure do you suppose they keep vodka for sale said the soldier succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off together with the blackened stocking 
 in spite of the dirtiness of the hut which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean and the smells of the marsh and the powder that filled the room and the absence of knives and forks the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen washed and clean they went into a hay barn swept ready for them where the coachmen had been making up beds for the gentlemen 
 though it was dusk not one of them wanted to go to sleep 
 after wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns of dogs and of former shooting parties the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them after vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay this delightful broken telega he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out of the good nature of the peasants who had treated him to vodka of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at where he had stayed the previous summer malthus was a capitalist who had made his money by speculation in railway shares stepan arkadyevich described what snipe moors this malthus had taken on lease in the tver province and how they were preserved and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh 
 i understand you said levin sitting up in the hay how is it such people disgust you i can understand a lunch with lafitte is all very pleasant but you dislike just that very sumptuousness all these people just like our tax farmers in the old days get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone they care for their contempt and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved 
 perfectly true chimed in vassenka veslovsky perfectly oblonsky of course goes out of bonhomie but other people say well oblonsky stays with them 
 not a bit of it levin could hear that oblonsky was smiling as he spoke i simply consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman all made their money alike by their work and their intelligence 
 oh by what work do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them 
 of course work work in this sense that if it were not for him and others like him there would have been no railways 
 but not work like the work of a peasant or in a learned profession 
 granted but work in the sense that his activity produces a result the railways but of course you think the railways useless 
 no another question i am disposed to admit that useful but all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest 
 but who is to define what is proportionate 
 making profit by dishonest means by trickery said levin conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty such as banking for instance he went on an evil the amassing of huge fortunes without labor just the same thing as with the tax farmers only the form changed le roi est mort vive le roi no sooner were the tax farmers abolished than the railways came up and banking companies that too is profit without work 
 yes that may all be very true and clever lie down krak stepan arkadyevich called to his dog who was scratching and turning over all the hay he was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position and so talked serenely and without haste but you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work that i receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk though he knows more about the work than i do dishonest i suppose 
 i say 
 well but i can tell you your receiving some five thousand say for your work on the land while our host the peasant here however hard he works can never get more than fifty roubles is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk and malthus getting more than a railway expert no quite the contrary i see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people which is utterly baseless and i fancy envy at the bottom of it 
 no unfair said veslovsky how could envy come in there is something unclean about that sort of business 
 you say levin went on that unjust for me to receive five thousand while the peasant has fifty roubles true it is unfair and i feel it but 
 it really is why is it we spend our time riding drinking shooting doing nothing while they are forever at work said vassenka veslovsky obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity 
 yes you feel it but you give him your property said stepan arkadyevich intentionally as it seemed provoking levin 
 there had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two as though since they had married sisters a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation as it began to take a personal note 
 i give it away because no one demands that from me and if i wanted to i could not give it away answered levin and have no one to give it to 
 give it to this peasant he would not refuse it 
 yes but how am i to give it up am i to go to him and make a title deed 
 i know but if you are convinced that you have no right 
 not at all convinced on the contrary i feel have no right to give it up that i have duties both to the land and to my family 
 no excuse me but if you consider this inequality is unjust why is it you act accordingly 
 well i do act negatively on that idea so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me 
 no excuse me a paradox 
 yes something of a sophistry about that veslovsky agreed ah our host he said to the peasant who came into the barn opening the creaking door how is it not asleep yet 
 no one to sleep i thought our gentlemen would be asleep but i heard them chattering i want to get a hook from here she bite he added stepping cautiously with his bare feet 
 and where are you going to sleep 
 we are going out for night watching 
 ah what a night said veslovsky looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed droshky that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors but listen there are voices singing and on my word not badly too that singing my friend 
 the housemaids from hard by here 
 go take a walk we go to sleep you know oblonsky come along 
 if one could only do both lie here and go answered oblonsky stretching capital lying here 
 well i shall go by myself said veslovsky getting up eagerly and putting on his boots and stockings gentlemen if fun fetch you treated me to some good sport and i forget you 
 he really is a capital fellow he said stepan arkadyevich when veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him 
 yes capital answered levin still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before it seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity and yet both of them straightforward men and not fools had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries this disconcerted him 
 just this my dear boy one must do one of two things either admit that the existing order of society is just and then stick up for rights in it or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges as i do and then enjoy them and be satisfied 
 no if it were unjust you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied at least i could not the great thing for me is to feel that not to blame 
 what do you say why not go after all said stepan arkadyevich evidently weary of the strain of thought we go to sleep you know come go 
 levin did not answer what they had said in the conversation that he acted justly only in a negative sense absorbed his thoughts can it be that only possible to be just negatively he was asking himself 
 how strong the smell of the fresh hay is though said stepan arkadyevich getting up not a chance of sleeping vassenka has been getting up some fun there do you hear the laughter and his voice we better go come along 
 no not coming answered levin 
 surely not a matter of principle too said stepan arkadyevich smiling as he felt about in the dark for his cap 
 not a matter of principle but why should i go 
 but do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself said stepan arkadyevich finding his cap and getting up 
 how so 
 do you suppose i see the line taken up with your wife i heard how a question of the greatest consequence whether or not to be away for a couple of days shooting all very well as an idyllic episode but for your whole life that answer a man must be independent he has his masculine interests a man has to be manly said oblonsky opening the door 
 in what way to go running after servant girls said levin 
 why not if it amuses him a ne tire pas consequence it do my wife any harm and amuse me the great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home there should be nothing in the home but tie your own hands 
 perhaps so said levin dryly and he turned on his side tomorrow early i want to go shooting and i wake anyone and shall set off at daybreak 
 messieurs venez vite they heard the voice of veslovsky coming back charmante made such a discovery charmante a perfect gretchen and already made friends with her really exceedingly pretty he declared in a tone of approval as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account and he were expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him

 messieurs venez vite they heard the voice of veslovsky coming back charmante made such a discovery charmante a perfect gretchen and already made friends with her really exceedingly pretty he declared in a tone of approval as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account and he were expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him 
 levin pretended to be asleep while oblonsky putting on his slippers and lighting a cigar walked out of the barn and soon their voices were lost 
 for a long while levin could not get to sleep he heard his horses munching hay then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready and then going off for the night watching then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn with his nephew the younger son of their peasant host he heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day and the soldier in a husky sleepy voice telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh and would shoot with their guns and then to check the questions he said go to sleep vaska go to sleep or catch it and soon after he began snoring himself and everything was still he could only hear the neigh of the horses and the guttural cry of a snipe is it really only negative he repeated to himself well what of it not my fault and he began thinking about the next day 
 tomorrow go out early and make a point of keeping cool there are lots of snipe and there are double snipe too when i come back be the note from kitty yes stiva may be right not manly with her tied to her apron strings well it be helped negative again 
 half asleep he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and stepan arkadyevich for an instant he opened his eyes the moon was up and in the open doorway brightly lighted up by the moonlight they were standing talking stepan arkadyevich was saying something of the freshness of one girl comparing her to a freshly peeled nut and veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words probably said to him by a peasant ah better get round your own wife levin half asleep said 
 gentlemen tomorrow before daylight and fell asleep

 waking up at earliest dawn levin tried to wake his companions vassenka lying on his stomach with one leg in a stocking thrust out was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response oblonsky half asleep declined to get up so early even laska who was asleep curled up in the hay got up unwillingly and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other getting on his boots taking his gun and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn levin went out into the road the coachmen were sleeping near their carriages the horses were dozing only one was lazily eating oats scattering them in the manger when snorting it was still gray 
 why are you up so early my dear the old woman their hostess said coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend 
 going shooting auntie do i go this way to the marsh 
 straight out at the back by our threshing floor my dear and hemp patches a little footpath 
 stepping carefully with her sunburned bare feet the old woman conducted levin and moved back the gate for him by the threshing floor 
 straight ahead and come to the marsh our lads drove the horses there yesterday evening 
 laska ran eagerly forward along the little path levin followed her with a light rapid step continually looking at the sky he hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh but the sun did not delay the moon which had been bright when he went out by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver the rosy flush of dawn which one could not help seeing before now had to be sought to be discerned at all what before had been undefined vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen they were sheaves of rye the dew not visible till the sun was up wetted legs and his blouse above his belt in the fragrant hemp patch from which the male plants had already been gathered in in the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible a bee flew by ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet he looked carefully and saw a second and a third they were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh the path led straight to the marsh the marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it thicker in one place and thinner in another so that the sedge and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist at the edge of the marsh and the road peasant boys and men who had been herding for the night were lying and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats not far from them were three hobbled horses one of them clanked a chain laska walked beside her master pressing a little forward and looking round passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds levin examined his percussion caps and unleashed his dog one of the horses a sleek seeing the dog started away switched its tail and snorted the other horses too were frightened and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound they bounded out of the marsh laska stopped looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at levin levin patted laska and whistled as a sign that she might begin 
 laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the quagmire that quaked under her 
 running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots marsh plants and dross and the extraneous smell of horse manure laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh the scent of that bird that always excited her more than any other here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter to find the direction she had to get farther away from the wind not feeling the motion of her legs laska bounded with a still gallop so that at each bound she could stop short to the right away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise and turned facing the wind sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils she felt at once that not their traces only but they themselves were here before her not one but many laska slackened her speed they were here but where precisely she could not yet determine to find the very spot she began to make a circle when suddenly her voice drew her off laska here he said pointing her to a different direction she stopped asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun but he repeated his command in an angry voice pointing to a hummock spot covered with water where there could not be anything she obeyed him pretending she was searching so as to please him went round it and went back to her former position and was at once aware of the scent again now when he was not hindering her she knew what to do and without looking at what was under her feet and to her vexation stumbling over a hummock into the water but righting herself with her strong supple legs she began making the circuit which was to make all clear to her the scent of them reached her stronger and stronger and more and more defined and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here behind this hummock five paces in front of her she stopped and her whole body was still and rigid on her short legs she could see nothing in front of her but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off she stood still feeling more and more conscious of it and enjoying it in anticipation her tail was stretched straight and tense and only wagged at the extreme tip her mouth was slightly open her ears raised one ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up and she breathed heavily but warily and still more warily she turned around but more with her eyes than her head to her master he was coming along with the face she knew so well though the eyes were always terrible to her he stumbled over the hummocks as he came and moved as she thought extraordinarily slowly she thought he came slowly but he was running 
 noticing special attitude as she crouched on the ground as it were scratching big prints with her hind paws and with her mouth slightly open levin knew she was pointing at double snipe and with an inward prayer for luck especially with the first bird he ran up to her coming quite close up to her he could from his height look beyond her and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose in a space between two little hummocks at a couple of yards distance he could see a double snipe turning its head it was listening then lightly preening and folding its wings it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail 
 fetch it fetch it shouted levin giving laska a shove from behind 
 but i go thought laska where am i to go from here i feel them but if i move forward i shall know nothing of where they are or who they are but then he shoved her with his knee and in an excited whisper said fetch it lassochka fetch it 
 well if what he wishes do it but i answer for myself now she thought and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the hummocks she scented nothing now she could only see and hear without understanding anything 
 ten paces from her former place a double snipe rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar convex sound of its wings and immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire another bird did not linger but rose behind levin without the offices 
 when levin turned toward it it was already some way off but his shot caught it flying twenty paces farther the second double snipe rose upward and whirling round like a ball dropped heavily on a dry place 
 come this is going to be some good thought levin packing the warm and fat snipe into his gamebag eh laska will it be good 
 when levin after reloading his gun moved on the sun had fully risen though unseen behind clouds the moon had lost all of its luster and was like a white cloud in the sky not a single star could be seen the soggy places silvery with dew before now shone like gold the rusty pools were all like amber the blue of the grass had changed to yellow green the marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows a hawk woke up and settled on a haycock turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh crows were flying about the field and a barelegged boy was driving the horses to an old man who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair the smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass

 next day at ten levin who had already gone his rounds knocked at the room where vassenka had been put for the night 
 entrez veslovsky called to him excuse me only just finished my ablutions he said smiling standing before him in his underclothes only 
 mind me please levin sat down in the window have you slept well 
 like the dead what sort of day is it for shooting 
 what will you take tea or coffee 
 neither wait till lunch really ashamed i suppose the ladies are down a walk now would be capital you show me your horses 
 after walking about the garden visiting the stable and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars levin returned to the house with his guest and went with him into the drawing room 
 we had splendid shooting and so many delightful experiences said veslovsky going up to kitty who was sitting at the samovar what a pity ladies are cut off from these delights 
 well i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house levin said to himself again he fancied something in the smile in the air with which their guest addressed kitty 
 the princess sitting on the other side of the table with marya vlassyevna and stepan arkadyevich called levin to her side and began to talk to him about moving to moscow for confinement and getting ready rooms for them just as levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding as derogatory to the grandeur of the event now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth the date of which they reckoned it seemed on their fingers he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious endless strips of knitting the triangles of linen to which dolly attached special importance and so on the birth of a son he was certain it would be a son which was promised him but which he still could not believe in so marvelous it seemed presented itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that did happen to people jarred on him as confusing and humiliating 
 but the princess did not understand his feelings and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she gave him no peace she had commissioned stepan arkadyevich to look at an apartment and now she called levin to her 
 i know nothing about it princess do as you think fit he said 
 you must decide when you will move 
 i really know i know millions of children are born away from moscow and doctors why 
 but if so 
 oh no as kitty wishes 
 we talk to kitty about it do you want me to frighten her why this spring natalie golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor 
 i will do just what you say he said gloomily 
 the princess began talking to him but he did not hear her though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him he was gloomy not on account of that conversation but from what he saw at the samovar 
 no impossible he thought glancing now and then at vassenka bending over kitty telling her something with his charming smile and at her flushed and disturbed 
 there was something unclean in attitude in his eyes in his smile levin even saw something unclean in attitude and look and again the light died away in his eyes again as before all of a sudden without the slightest transition he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness peace and dignity into an abyss of despair rage and humiliation again everything and everyone had become hateful to him 
 you do just as you think best princess he said again looking round 
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown stepan arkadyevich said playfully hinting evidently not simply at the conversation but at the cause of agitation which he had noticed how late you are today dolly 
 everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna vassenka only rose for an instant and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man he scarcely bowed and resumed his conversation again laughing at something 
 masha has been almost the end of me she did not sleep well and is dreadfully capricious today said dolly 
 the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening discussing anna and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations kitty disliked the conversation and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted and especially by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband but she was too simple and unsophisticated to know how to cut short this conversation or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young very obvious admiration she wanted to stop this conversation but she did not know what to do whatever she did she knew it would be observed by her husband and the worst interpretation put on it and in fact when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha and vassenka waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over began to gaze indifferently at dolly the question struck levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy 
 what do you say shall we go and look for mushrooms today said dolly 
 by all means please and i shall come too said kitty and she blushed she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would come and she did not ask him where are you going kostia she asked her husband with a guilty face as he passed by her with a resolute step this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions 
 the mechanician came when i was away i seen him yet he said not looking at her 
 he went downstairs but before he had time to leave his study he heard his familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him 
 what do you want he said to her shortly we are busy 
 i beg your pardon she said to the german mechanician i want a few words with my husband 
 the german would have left the room but levin said to him 
 disturb yourself 
 the train is at three queried the german i be late 
 levin did not answer him but walked out himself with his wife 
 well what have you to say to me he said to her in french 
 he did not look her in the face and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over and had a piteous crushed look 
 i i want to say that we go on like this that this is misery she said 
 the servants are here at the buttery he said angrily make a scene 
 well go in here 
 they were standing in the passage room kitty would have gone into the next room but there the english governess was giving tania a lesson 
 well come into the garden 
 in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path and no longer considering that the peasant could see her and his agitated face that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster they went on with rapid steps feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings must be alone together and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling 
 we go on like this misery i am wretched you are wretched what for she said when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the linden tree avenue 
 but tell me one thing was there in his tone anything unseemly unclean humiliatingly horrible he said standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest as he had stood before her that night 
 yes she said in a shaking voice but kostia surely you see not to blame all the morning been trying to take a tone but such people why did he come how happy we were she said breathless with the sobs that shook her 
 although nothing had been pursuing them and there was nothing to run away from and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces

 i beg your pardon she said to the german mechanician i want a few words with my husband 
 the german would have left the room but levin said to him 
 disturb yourself 
 the train is at three queried the german i be late 
 levin did not answer him but walked out himself with his wife 
 well what have you to say to me he said to her in french 
 he did not look her in the face and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over and had a piteous crushed look 
 i i want to say that we go on like this that this is misery she said 
 the servants are here at the buttery he said angrily make a scene 
 well go in here 
 they were standing in the passage room kitty would have gone into the next room but there the english governess was giving tania a lesson 
 well come into the garden 
 in the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path and no longer considering that the peasant could see her and his agitated face that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster they went on with rapid steps feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings must be alone together and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling 
 we go on like this misery i am wretched you are wretched what for she said when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the linden tree avenue 
 but tell me one thing was there in his tone anything unseemly unclean humiliatingly horrible he said standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest as he had stood before her that night 
 yes she said in a shaking voice but kostia surely you see not to blame all the morning been trying to take a tone but such people why did he come how happy we were she said breathless with the sobs that shook her 
 although nothing had been pursuing them and there was nothing to run away from and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces

 next day at ten levin who had already gone his rounds knocked at the room where vassenka had been put for the night 
 entrez veslovsky called to him excuse me only just finished my ablutions he said smiling standing before him in his underclothes only 
 mind me please levin sat down in the window have you slept well 
 like the dead what sort of day is it for shooting 
 what will you take tea or coffee 
 neither wait till lunch really ashamed i suppose the ladies are down a walk now would be capital you show me your horses 
 after walking about the garden visiting the stable and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars levin returned to the house with his guest and went with him into the drawing room 
 we had splendid shooting and so many delightful experiences said veslovsky going up to kitty who was sitting at the samovar what a pity ladies are cut off from these delights 
 well i suppose he must say something to the lady of the house levin said to himself again he fancied something in the smile in the air with which their guest addressed kitty 
 the princess sitting on the other side of the table with marya vlassyevna and stepan arkadyevich called levin to her side and began to talk to him about moving to moscow for confinement and getting ready rooms for them just as levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding as derogatory to the grandeur of the event now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth the date of which they reckoned it seemed on their fingers he tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious endless strips of knitting the triangles of linen to which dolly attached special importance and so on the birth of a son he was certain it would be a son which was promised him but which he still could not believe in so marvelous it seemed presented itself to his mind on one hand as a happiness so immense and therefore so incredible on the other as an event so mysterious that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be and consequent preparation for it as for something ordinary that did happen to people jarred on him as confusing and humiliating 
 but the princess did not understand his feelings and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference and so she gave him no peace she had commissioned stepan arkadyevich to look at an apartment and now she called levin to her 
 i know nothing about it princess do as you think fit he said 
 you must decide when you will move 
 i really know i know millions of children are born away from moscow and doctors why 
 but if so 
 oh no as kitty wishes 
 we talk to kitty about it do you want me to frighten her why this spring natalie golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor 
 i will do just what you say he said gloomily 
 the princess began talking to him but he did not hear her though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him he was gloomy not on account of that conversation but from what he saw at the samovar 
 no impossible he thought glancing now and then at vassenka bending over kitty telling her something with his charming smile and at her flushed and disturbed 
 there was something unclean in attitude in his eyes in his smile levin even saw something unclean in attitude and look and again the light died away in his eyes again as before all of a sudden without the slightest transition he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness peace and dignity into an abyss of despair rage and humiliation again everything and everyone had become hateful to him 
 you do just as you think best princess he said again looking round 
 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown stepan arkadyevich said playfully hinting evidently not simply at the conversation but at the cause of agitation which he had noticed how late you are today dolly 
 everyone got up to greet darya alexandrovna vassenka only rose for an instant and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man he scarcely bowed and resumed his conversation again laughing at something 
 masha has been almost the end of me she did not sleep well and is dreadfully capricious today said dolly 
 the conversation vassenka had started with kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening discussing anna and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations kitty disliked the conversation and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted and especially by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband but she was too simple and unsophisticated to know how to cut short this conversation or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young very obvious admiration she wanted to stop this conversation but she did not know what to do whatever she did she knew it would be observed by her husband and the worst interpretation put on it and in fact when she asked dolly what was wrong with masha and vassenka waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over began to gaze indifferently at dolly the question struck levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy 
 what do you say shall we go and look for mushrooms today said dolly 
 by all means please and i shall come too said kitty and she blushed she wanted from politeness to ask vassenka whether he would come and she did not ask him where are you going kostia she asked her husband with a guilty face as he passed by her with a resolute step this guilty air confirmed all his suspicions 
 the mechanician came when i was away i seen him yet he said not looking at her 
 he went downstairs but before he had time to leave his study he heard his familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him 
 what do you want he said to her shortly we are busy 
 i beg your pardon she said to the german mechanician i want a few words with my husband 
 the german would have left the room but levin said to him

 the train is at three queried the german i be late 
 levin did not answer him but walked out himself with his wife

 well go in here 
 they were standing in the passage room kitty would have gone into the next room but there the english governess was giving tania a lesson

 after escorting his wife upstairs levin went to part of the house darya alexandrovna for her part was also in great distress that day she was walking about the room talking angrily to a little girl who stood in the corner bawling 
 and you shall stand all day in the corner and have your dinner all alone and not see one of your dolls and i make you a new frock she said not knowing how to punish her 
 oh she is a disgusting child she turned to levin where does she get such wicked propensities 
 why what has she done levin said without much interest for he had wanted to ask her advice and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment 
 grisha and she went into the raspberries and there i tell you really what she did a thousand pities miss not with us this one sees to nothing a machine que la petite 
 and darya alexandrovna described crime 
 that proves nothing not a question of evil propensities at all simply mischief levin assured her 
 but you are upset about something what have you come for asked dolly going on there 
 and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for him to say what he had meant to say 
 not been in there been alone in the garden with kitty had a quarrel for the second time since stiva came 
 dolly looked at him with her shrewd comprehending eyes 
 come tell me honor bright has there been not in kitty but in that behavior a tone which might be unpleasant not unpleasant but horrible offensive to a husband 
 you mean how shall i say stand there stand in the corner she said to masha who detecting a faint smile on her face had been turning round the opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave il fait le cour une jeune et jolie femme and a husband a man of the world should only be flattered by it 
 yes yes said levin gloomily but you noticed it 
 not only i but stiva noticed it just after breakfast he said to me je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour kitty 
 well all right then now satisfied send him away said levin 
 what do you mean are you crazy dolly cried in horror nonsense kostia only think she said laughing you can go now to fanny she said to masha no if you wish it speak to stiva take him away he can say expecting visitors altogether he fit into the house 
 no no do it myself 
 but quarrel with him 
 not a bit i shall so enjoy it levin said his eyes flashing with real enjoyment come forgive her dolly she do it again he said of the little sinner who had not gone to fanny but was standing irresolutely before her mother waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her eye 
 the mother glanced at her the child broke into sobs hid her face on her lap and dolly laid her thin tender hand on her head 
 and what is there in common between us and him thought levin and he went off to look for veslovsky 
 as he passed through the hall he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station 
 the spring was broken yesterday said the footman 
 well the tarantass then and make haste the visitor 
 the gone to his room 
 levin came upon vassenka at the moment when the latter having unpacked his things from his trunk and laid out some new songs was putting on his leather gaiters to go out riding 
 whether there was something exceptional in face or that vassenka was himself conscious that le petit brin de cour he was making was out of place in this family he was somewhat as much as a young man in society can be disconcerted at entrance 
 you ride in gaiters 
 yes much cleaner said vassenka putting his fat leg on a chair fastening the bottom hook and smiling with simplehearted good humor 
 he was undoubtedly a fellow and levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself as his host when he saw the shy look on face 
 on the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning at gymnastics trying to raise up the swollen bars levin took the fragment in his hands and began breaking off the split end of the stick not knowing how to begin 
 i wanted he paused but suddenly remembering kitty and everything that had happened he said looking him resolutely in the face i have ordered the horses to be put to for you 
 how so vassenka began in surprise to drive where 
 for you to drive to the station levin said gloomily pinching off the end of the stick 
 are you going away or has something happened 
 it happens that i expect visitors said levin his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick and not expecting visitors and nothing has happened but i beg you to go away you can explain my rudeness as you like 
 vassenka drew himself up 
 i beg you to explain he said with dignity understanding at last 
 i explain levin said softly and deliberately trying to control the trembling of his jaw and better not ask 
 and as the split ends were all broken off levin clutched the thick ends in his finger split the stick in two and carefully caught the end as it fell 
 probably the sight of those tense hands of the same muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics of the glittering eyes the soft voice and quivering jaws convinced vassenka better than any words he bowed shrugging his shoulders and smiling contemptuously 
 may i not see oblonsky 
 the shrug and the smile did not irritate levin what else was there for him to do he thought 
 send him to you at once 
 what madness is this stepan arkadyevich said when after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house he found levin in the garden where he was walking about waiting for his departure mais ridicule what flea has bitten you mais du dernier ridicule what did you think if a young man 
 but the place where levin had been bitten was evidently still sore for he turned pale again when stepan arkadyevich would have enlarged on the reason and he himself cut him short 
 please go into it i help it i feel ashamed of the way treating you and him but it be i imagine a great grief to him to go and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife 
 but insulting to him et puis ridicule 
 and to me both insulting and distressing and not in fault in any way and no need for me to suffer 
 well this i expect of you on peut tre jaloux mais ce point du dernier ridicule 
 levin turned quickly and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue and he went on walking up and down alone soon he heard the rumble of the tarantass and saw from behind the trees how vassenka sitting in the hay unluckily there was no seat in the tarantass in his scotch cap was driven along the avenue jolting up and down over the ruts 
 this levin thought when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the tarantass it was the mechanician whom levin had totally forgotten the mechanician bowing low said something to veslovsky then clambered into the tarantass and they drove off together 
 stepan arkadyevich and the princess were much upset by action and he himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule but also utterly guilty and disgraced but remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through when he asked himself how he should act another time he answered that he would do precisely the same 
 in spite of all this toward the end of that day everyone except the princess who could not pardon action became extraordinarily lively and like children after a punishment or people after a dreary ceremonious reception so that by the evening dismissal was spoken of in the absence of the princess as though it were some remote event and dolly who had inherited her gift of humorous storytelling made varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time always with fresh humorous additions how she had just put on her new ribands for the benefit of the visitor and on going into the drawing room had suddenly heard the rumble of the chariot and who should be in the chariot but vassenka himself with his scotch cap and his songs and his gaiters and all sitting in the hay 
 if only ordered out the carriage but no and then i hear stop oh i thought relented i look out and a fat german is being sat down by him and driving away and my new ribands all for nothing

 dolly looked at him with her shrewd comprehending eyes 
 come tell me honor bright has there been not in kitty but in that behavior a tone which might be unpleasant not unpleasant but horrible offensive to a husband 
 you mean how shall i say stand there stand in the corner she said to masha who detecting a faint smile on her face had been turning round the opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave il fait le cour une jeune et jolie femme and a husband a man of the world should only be flattered by it 
 yes yes said levin gloomily but you noticed it 
 not only i but stiva noticed it just after breakfast he said to me je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour kitty 
 well all right then now satisfied send him away said levin 
 what do you mean are you crazy dolly cried in horror nonsense kostia only think she said laughing you can go now to fanny she said to masha no if you wish it speak to stiva take him away he can say expecting visitors altogether he fit into the house 
 no no do it myself 
 but quarrel with him 
 not a bit i shall so enjoy it levin said his eyes flashing with real enjoyment come forgive her dolly she do it again he said of the little sinner who had not gone to fanny but was standing irresolutely before her mother waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her eye 
 the mother glanced at her the child broke into sobs hid her face on her lap and dolly laid her thin tender hand on her head 
 and what is there in common between us and him thought levin and he went off to look for veslovsky 
 as he passed through the hall he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station 
 the spring was broken yesterday said the footman 
 well the tarantass then and make haste the visitor 
 the gone to his room 
 levin came upon vassenka at the moment when the latter having unpacked his things from his trunk and laid out some new songs was putting on his leather gaiters to go out riding 
 whether there was something exceptional in face or that vassenka was himself conscious that le petit brin de cour he was making was out of place in this family he was somewhat as much as a young man in society can be disconcerted at entrance 
 you ride in gaiters 
 yes much cleaner said vassenka putting his fat leg on a chair fastening the bottom hook and smiling with simplehearted good humor 
 he was undoubtedly a fellow and levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself as his host when he saw the shy look on face 
 on the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning at gymnastics trying to raise up the swollen bars levin took the fragment in his hands and began breaking off the split end of the stick not knowing how to begin 
 i wanted he paused but suddenly remembering kitty and everything that had happened he said looking him resolutely in the face i have ordered the horses to be put to for you 
 how so vassenka began in surprise to drive where 
 for you to drive to the station levin said gloomily pinching off the end of the stick 
 are you going away or has something happened 
 it happens that i expect visitors said levin his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick and not expecting visitors and nothing has happened but i beg you to go away you can explain my rudeness as you like 
 vassenka drew himself up 
 i beg you to explain he said with dignity understanding at last 
 i explain levin said softly and deliberately trying to control the trembling of his jaw and better not ask 
 and as the split ends were all broken off levin clutched the thick ends in his finger split the stick in two and carefully caught the end as it fell 
 probably the sight of those tense hands of the same muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics of the glittering eyes the soft voice and quivering jaws convinced vassenka better than any words he bowed shrugging his shoulders and smiling contemptuously 
 may i not see oblonsky 
 the shrug and the smile did not irritate levin what else was there for him to do he thought 
 send him to you at once 
 what madness is this stepan arkadyevich said when after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house he found levin in the garden where he was walking about waiting for his departure mais ridicule what flea has bitten you mais du dernier ridicule what did you think if a young man 
 but the place where levin had been bitten was evidently still sore for he turned pale again when stepan arkadyevich would have enlarged on the reason and he himself cut him short 
 please go into it i help it i feel ashamed of the way treating you and him but it be i imagine a great grief to him to go and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife 
 but insulting to him et puis ridicule 
 and to me both insulting and distressing and not in fault in any way and no need for me to suffer 
 well this i expect of you on peut tre jaloux mais ce point du dernier ridicule 
 levin turned quickly and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue and he went on walking up and down alone soon he heard the rumble of the tarantass and saw from behind the trees how vassenka sitting in the hay unluckily there was no seat in the tarantass in his scotch cap was driven along the avenue jolting up and down over the ruts 
 this levin thought when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the tarantass it was the mechanician whom levin had totally forgotten the mechanician bowing low said something to veslovsky then clambered into the tarantass and they drove off together 
 stepan arkadyevich and the princess were much upset by action and he himself felt not only in the highest degree ridicule but also utterly guilty and disgraced but remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through when he asked himself how he should act another time he answered that he would do precisely the same 
 in spite of all this toward the end of that day everyone except the princess who could not pardon action became extraordinarily lively and like children after a punishment or people after a dreary ceremonious reception so that by the evening dismissal was spoken of in the absence of the princess as though it were some remote event and dolly who had inherited her gift of humorous storytelling made varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time always with fresh humorous additions how she had just put on her new ribands for the benefit of the visitor and on going into the drawing room had suddenly heard the rumble of the chariot and who should be in the chariot but vassenka himself with his scotch cap and his songs and his gaiters and all sitting in the hay 
 if only ordered out the carriage but no and then i hear stop oh i thought relented i look out and a fat german is being sat down by him and driving away and my new ribands all for nothing

 darya alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see anna she was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything levin disliked she quite understood how right the levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with vronsky but she felt she must go and see anna and show her that her feelings could not be changed in spite of the change in her position 
 that she might be independent of the levins in this expedition darya alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive but levin learning of it went to her to protest 
 what makes you suppose that i dislike your going but even if did dislike it i should still more dislike your not taking my horses he said you never told me that you were going definitely hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me and of more importance undertake the job and never get you there i have horses and if you want to wound me take mine 
 darya alexandrovna had to consent and on the day fixed levin had ready for his a set of four horses and relays getting them together from the farm and saddle horses not at all a set but capable of taking darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day at that moment when horses were wanted for the princess who was going and for the midwife it was a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow darya alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house moreover he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her darya pecuniary affairs which were in a very unsatisfactory state were taken to heart by the levins as if they were their own 
 darya alexandrovna by advice started before daybreak the road was good the carriage comfortable the horses trotted along merrily and on the box beside the coachman sat the countinghouse clerk whom levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security darya alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed 
 after drinking tea at the same with whom levin had stayed on the way to and chatting with the women about their children and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praised very highly darya alexandrovna at ten went on again at home looking after her children she had no time to think so now after this journey of four hours all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain and she thought over all her life as she never had before and from the most different points of view her thoughts seemed strange even to herself at first she thought about the children about whom she was uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckoned more upon her had promised to look after them if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks if grisha kicked by a horse and stomach upset again but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future she began thinking how she had to get a new flat in moscow for the coming winter to renew the furniture and to make her elder girl a cloak then questions of the more remote future occurred to her how she was to place her children in the world the girls are all right she thought but the boys 
 all very fine for me to be teaching grisha but of course only because i am free myself now not with child stiva of course no counting on and with the help of friends i can bring them up but if another baby coming and the thought struck her how unjustly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children the birth itself nothing but the months of carrying the child so intolerable she thought picturing to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby and she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn on being asked whether she had any children the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully 
 i had a girl baby but god set me free i buried her last lent 
 well did you grieve very much for her asked darya alexandrovna 
 why grieve the old man has grandchildren enough as it is it was only a trouble no working nor nothing only a tie 
 this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recalling these words in those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth 
 yes in general thought darya alexandrovna looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all hideousness kitty young and pretty as she is even kitty has lost her looks and i when with child become hideous i know it the birth the agony the hideous agonies that last moment then the nursing the sleepless nights the fearful pains 
 darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child then the illnesses that everlasting apprehension then bringing them up evil propensities she thought of little crime among the raspberries education latin all so incomprehensible and difficult and on the top of it all the death of these children and there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tore her heart of the death of her last little baby who had died of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own torn heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with the curls falling on temples and the open wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a gallooned cross on it

 darya alexandrovna had to consent and on the day fixed levin had ready for his a set of four horses and relays getting them together from the farm and saddle horses not at all a set but capable of taking darya alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day at that moment when horses were wanted for the princess who was going and for the midwife it was a difficult matter for levin to make up the number but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow darya alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house moreover he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her darya pecuniary affairs which were in a very unsatisfactory state were taken to heart by the levins as if they were their own 
 darya alexandrovna by advice started before daybreak the road was good the carriage comfortable the horses trotted along merrily and on the box beside the coachman sat the countinghouse clerk whom levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security darya alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed 
 after drinking tea at the same with whom levin had stayed on the way to and chatting with the women about their children and with the old man about count vronsky whom the latter praised very highly darya alexandrovna at ten went on again at home looking after her children she had no time to think so now after this journey of four hours all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain and she thought over all her life as she never had before and from the most different points of view her thoughts seemed strange even to herself at first she thought about the children about whom she was uneasy although the princess and kitty she reckoned more upon her had promised to look after them if only masha does not begin her naughty tricks if grisha kicked by a horse and stomach upset again but these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future she began thinking how she had to get a new flat in moscow for the coming winter to renew the furniture and to make her elder girl a cloak then questions of the more remote future occurred to her how she was to place her children in the world the girls are all right she thought but the boys 
 all very fine for me to be teaching grisha but of course only because i am free myself now not with child stiva of course no counting on and with the help of friends i can bring them up but if another baby coming and the thought struck her how unjustly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children the birth itself nothing but the months of carrying the child so intolerable she thought picturing to herself her last pregnancy and the death of the last baby and she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn on being asked whether she had any children the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully 
 i had a girl baby but god set me free i buried her last lent 
 well did you grieve very much for her asked darya alexandrovna 
 why grieve the old man has grandchildren enough as it is it was only a trouble no working nor nothing only a tie 
 this answer had struck darya alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the and pleasing face of the young woman but now she could not help recalling these words in those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth 
 yes in general thought darya alexandrovna looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life pregnancy sickness mental incapacity indifference to everything and most of all hideousness kitty young and pretty as she is even kitty has lost her looks and i when with child become hideous i know it the birth the agony the hideous agonies that last moment then the nursing the sleepless nights the fearful pains 
 darya alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child then the illnesses that everlasting apprehension then bringing them up evil propensities she thought of little crime among the raspberries education latin all so incomprehensible and difficult and on the top of it all the death of these children and there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory that always tore her heart of the death of her last little baby who had died of croup his funeral the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin and her own torn heart and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with the curls falling on temples and the open wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a gallooned cross on it 
 and all this it for what is to come of it all this wasting my life never having a peace either with child or nursing a child forever irritable peevish wretched myself and worrying others repulsive to my husband while the children are growing up unhappy badly educated and penniless even now if it for spending the summer at the levins i know how we should be managing to live of course kostia and kitty have so much tact that we feel it but it go on have children they be able to keep us a drag on them as it is how is papa who has hardly anything left for himself to help us so that i even bring the children up by myself and may find it hard with the help of other people at the cost of humiliation why even if we suppose the greatest good luck that the children die and i bring them up somehow at the very best simply be decent people all i can hope for and to gain simply that what agonies what toil whole life ruined again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said and again she was revolted at the thought but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words 
 is it far now mikhaila darya alexandrovna asked the countinghouse clerk to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her 
 from this village they say seven verstas 
 the carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge on the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders cheerfully chattering they stood still on the bridge staring inquisitively at the carriage all the faces turned to darya alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy making her envious of their enjoyment of life all living all enjoying life darya alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage while i let out as it were from prison from the world of worries that fret me to death am only looking about me now for an instant they all live those peasant women and my sister natalie and varenka and anna whom i am going to see all but not i 
 and they attack anna what for am i any better i have at any rate a husband i love not as i should like to love him still i do love him while anna never loved hers how is she to blame she wants to live god has put that in our hearts very likely i should have done the same even to this day i feel sure i did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in moscow i ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life anew i might have loved and have been loved in reality and is it any better as it is i respect him necessary to me she thought about her husband and i put up with him is that any better at that time i could still have been admired i had beauty left me still darya alexandrovna pursued her thoughts and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking glass she had a traveling looking glass in her handbag and she wanted to take it out but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying countinghouse clerk she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round and she did not take out the glass 
 but without looking in the glass she thought that even now it was not too late and she thought of sergei ivanovich who was always particularly attentive to her of goodhearted friend turovtsin who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina and was in love with her and there was someone else quite a young man who her husband had told her it as a joke thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters and the most passionate and impossible romances rose before darya imagination anna did quite right and certainly i shall never reproach her for it she is happy she makes another person happy and not broken down as i am but most likely just as she always was bright clever open to every impression thought darya alexandrovna and a sly smile curved her lips for as she pondered on love affair darya alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself with an imaginary composite figure the ideal man who was in love with her she like anna confessed the whole affair to her husband and the amazement and perplexity of stepan arkadyevich at this avowal made her smile 
 in such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to vozdivzhenskoe

 the coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right to a field of rye where some peasants were sitting near a telega the countinghouse clerk was just going to jump down but on second thought he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead and beckoned to them to come up the wind that seemed to blow as they drove dropped when the carriage stood still gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off the metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe that came to them from the telega ceased one of the peasants got up and came toward the carriage 
 well you are slow the countinghouse clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the unbeaten road come along do 
 a old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair and his bent back dark with perspiration came toward the carriage quickening his steps and took hold of the mudguard with his sunburned hand 
 vozdvizhenskoe the manor house the he repeated go on to the end of this slope then turn to the left straight along the avenue and come right upon it but whom do you want the count himself 
 well are they at home my good man darya alexandrovna said vaguely not knowing how to ask about anna even of this peasant 
 at home for sure said the peasant shifting from one bare foot to the other and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust sure to be at home he repeated evidently eager to talk only yesterday visitors arrived a sight of visitors come what do you want he turned round and called to a lad who was shouting something to him from the telega oh they all rode by here not long since to look at a reaping machine be home by now and who may you belong to 
 come a long way said the coachman climbing onto the box so not far 
 i tell you just here as soon as you get out he said keeping hold all the while of the mudguard of the carriage 
 a young fellow came up too 
 what is it laborers they want for the harvest he asked 
 i know my boy 
 so you keep to the left and come right on it said the peasant unmistakably loath to let the travelers go and eager to converse 
 the coachman started the horses but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted stop hi friend stop the coachman stopped 
 coming yonder shouted the peasant see what a turnout he said pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a charabanc coming along the road 
 they were vronsky with a jockey veslovsky and anna on horseback and princess varvara and sviiazhsky in the charabanc they had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine 
 when the carriage stopped the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace anna was in front beside veslovsky anna was quietly walking her horse a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail anna with her beautiful head her black hair straying loose under her high hat her full shoulders her slender waist in her black riding habit and all the ease and grace of her deportment impressed dolly 
 for the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for anna to be on horseback the conception of riding on horseback for a lady was in darva mind associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity which in her opinion was unbecoming in position but when she had scrutinized her seeing her closer she was at once reconciled to her riding in spite of her elegance everything was so simple quiet and dignified in the attitude the dress and the movements of anna that nothing could have been more natural 
 by the side of anna on a gray cavalry horse was vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with floating ribbons his stout legs stretched out in front obviously pleased with his own appearance darya alexandrovna could not suppress a smile as she recognized him behind rode vronsky on a dark bay mare obviously heated from galloping he was holding her in pulling at the reins 
 after him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey sviiazhsky and princess varvara in a new charabanc with a big trotting horse overtook the party on horseback 
 face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage she recognized dolly she uttered a cry started in the saddle and set her horse into a gallop on reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance and holding up her riding habit she ran up to greet dolly 
 i thought it was you and dared not think it how delightful you fancy how glad i am she said at one moment pressing her face against dolly and kissing her and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile a delightful surprise alexei she said looking round at vronsky who had dismounted and was walking toward them 
 vronsky taking off his tall gray hat went up to dolly 
 you believe how glad we are to see you he said giving peculiar significance to the words and showing his strong white teeth in a smile 
 vassenka veslovsky without getting off his horse took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head 
 princess varvara anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the charabanc drove up 
 ah said darya alexandrovna and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction 
 princess varvara was her aunt and she had long known her and did not respect her she knew that princess varvara had passed her whole life toadying to her rich relations but that she should now be sponging on vronsky a man who was nothing to her mortified dolly on account of her kinship with her husband anna noticed expression and was disconcerted by it she blushed dropped her riding habit and stumbled over it

 no stay as you were said anna coming up and go in the carriage and taking arm she drew her away 
 darya eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before the splendid horses and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her but what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in anna whom she knew so well and loved any other woman a less close observer not knowing anna before and particularly not having thought as darya alexandrovna had been thinking on the road would not have noticed anything special in anna but now dolly was struck by that temporary beauty which is only found in women during the moments of love and which she saw now in face everything in her face the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin the line of her lips the smile which as it were fluttered about her face the brilliance of her eyes the grace and rapidity of her movements the fullness of the notes of her voice even the manner in which with a sort of angry friendliness she answered veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost it was all peculiarly fascinating and it seemed as if anna herself were aware of it and rejoicing in it

 so you keep to the left and come right on it said the peasant unmistakably loath to let the travelers go and eager to converse 
 the coachman started the horses but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted stop hi friend stop the coachman stopped 
 coming yonder shouted the peasant see what a turnout he said pointing to four persons on horseback and two in a charabanc coming along the road 
 they were vronsky with a jockey veslovsky and anna on horseback and princess varvara and sviiazhsky in the charabanc they had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine 
 when the carriage stopped the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace anna was in front beside veslovsky anna was quietly walking her horse a sturdy english cob with cropped mane and short tail anna with her beautiful head her black hair straying loose under her high hat her full shoulders her slender waist in her black riding habit and all the ease and grace of her deportment impressed dolly 
 for the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for anna to be on horseback the conception of riding on horseback for a lady was in darva mind associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity which in her opinion was unbecoming in position but when she had scrutinized her seeing her closer she was at once reconciled to her riding in spite of her elegance everything was so simple quiet and dignified in the attitude the dress and the movements of anna that nothing could have been more natural 
 by the side of anna on a gray cavalry horse was vassenka veslovsky in his scotch cap with floating ribbons his stout legs stretched out in front obviously pleased with his own appearance darya alexandrovna could not suppress a smile as she recognized him behind rode vronsky on a dark bay mare obviously heated from galloping he was holding her in pulling at the reins 
 after him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey sviiazhsky and princess varvara in a new charabanc with a big trotting horse overtook the party on horseback 
 face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage she recognized dolly she uttered a cry started in the saddle and set her horse into a gallop on reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance and holding up her riding habit she ran up to greet dolly 
 i thought it was you and dared not think it how delightful you fancy how glad i am she said at one moment pressing her face against dolly and kissing her and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile a delightful surprise alexei she said looking round at vronsky who had dismounted and was walking toward them 
 vronsky taking off his tall gray hat went up to dolly 
 you believe how glad we are to see you he said giving peculiar significance to the words and showing his strong white teeth in a smile 
 vassenka veslovsky without getting off his horse took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head 
 princess varvara anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from dolly as the charabanc drove up 
 ah said darya alexandrovna and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction 
 princess varvara was her aunt and she had long known her and did not respect her she knew that princess varvara had passed her whole life toadying to her rich relations but that she should now be sponging on vronsky a man who was nothing to her mortified dolly on account of her kinship with her husband anna noticed expression and was disconcerted by it she blushed dropped her riding habit and stumbled over it 
 darya alexandrovna went up to the charabanc and coldly greeted princess varvara sviiazhsky too she knew he inquired how his queer friend with the young wife was and running his eyes over the horses and the carriage with its patched mudguards proposed to the ladies that they should get into the charabanc 
 and get in this vehicle he said the horse is quiet and the princess drives capitally 
 no stay as you were said anna coming up and go in the carriage and taking arm she drew her away 
 darya eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before the splendid horses and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her but what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in anna whom she knew so well and loved any other woman a less close observer not knowing anna before and particularly not having thought as darya alexandrovna had been thinking on the road would not have noticed anything special in anna but now dolly was struck by that temporary beauty which is only found in women during the moments of love and which she saw now in face everything in her face the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin the line of her lips the smile which as it were fluttered about her face the brilliance of her eyes the grace and rapidity of her movements the fullness of the notes of her voice even the manner in which with a sort of angry friendliness she answered veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost it was all peculiarly fascinating and it seemed as if anna herself were aware of it and rejoicing in it 
 when both the women were seated in the carriage a sudden embarrassment came over both of them anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry dolly fixed upon her dolly was embarrassed because after phrase about this vehicle she could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which anna was sitting with her the coachman philip and the countinghouse clerk were experiencing the same sensation the countinghouse clerk to conceal his confusion busied himself settling the ladies but philip the coachman became sullen and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority he smiled ironically looking at the raven horse and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the charabanc was only good for promenade and do forty verstas straight off in the heat 
 the peasants had all got up from the telega and were inquisitively and mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends making their comments on it 
 pleased too seen each other for a long while said the old man with the bast round his hair 
 i say uncle gherasim if we could take that raven horse now to cart the corn that ud be quick work 
 is that a woman in breeches said one of them pointing to vassenka veslovsky sitting in a sidesaddle 
 nay a man see how smartly going it 
 eh lads seems not going to sleep then 
 what chance of sleep today said the old man with a sidelong look at the sun past get your hooks and come along

 anna looked at thin careworn face with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking that is that dolly had grown thinner but conscious that she herself had grown handsomer and that eyes were telling her so she sighed and began to speak about herself 
 you are looking at me she said and wondering how i can be happy in my position well shameful to confess but i inexcusably happy something magical has happened to me like a dream when frightened and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more i have waked up i have lived through the misery the dread and now for a long while past especially since been here been so happy she said with a timid smile of inquiry looking at dolly 
 how glad i am said dolly smiling involuntarily speaking more coldly than she wanted to very glad for you why you written to me 
 why because i the courage you forget my position 
 to me the courage if you knew how i i look at 
 darya alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so 
 but of that talk later this what are all these buildings she asked wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac quite a little town 
 but anna did not answer 
 no no how do you look at my position what do you think of it she asked 
 i consider darya alexandrovna was beginning but at that instant vassenka veslovsky having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost galloped past them bumping heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the sidesaddle doing it anna arkadyevna he shouted anna did not even glance at him but again it seemed to darya alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage and so she cut short her thought 
 i think anything she said but i always loved you and if one loves anyone one loves the whole person just as that person is and not as one would like her or him to be 
 anna taking her eyes off her face and dropping her eyelids this was a new habit dolly had not seen in her before pondered trying to penetrate the full significance of the words and obviously interpreting them as she would have wished she glanced at dolly 
 if you had any sins she said they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words 
 and dolly saw that the tears stood in her eyes she pressed hand in silence 
 well what are these buildings how many there are of them after a silence she repeated her question 
 these are the houses stud farm and stables answered anna and there the park begins it had all gone to ruin but alexei had everything renewed he is very fond of this place and what i never expected he has become intensely interested in looking after it but his is such a rich nature whatever he takes up he does splendidly so far from being bored by it he works with passionate interest he with his temperament as i know it he has become careful and businesslike a manager he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land but only in that when a question of tens of thousands he think of money she spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them of those they love do you see that big building the new hospital i believe it will cost over a hundred thousand his dada just now and do you know how it all came about the peasants asked him for some meadowland i think it was at a cheaper rate and he refused and i accused him of being miserly of course it was not really because of that but because of everything together he began this hospital to prove do you see that he was not miserly about money une petitesse if you like but i love him all the more for it and now see the house in a moment it was his house and he has had nothing changed outside 
 how beautiful said dolly looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns standing out among the greens of the old trees in the garden 
 it fine and from the house from the top the view is wonderful 
 they drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mold of a flower bed and drew up in a covered entry 
 ah here already said anna looking at the saddle horses which were just being led away from the steps it is a good horse it my cob my favorite lead him here and bring me some sugar where is the count she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out ah there he is she said seeing vronsky coming to meet her with veslovsky 
 where are you going to put the princess said vronsky in french addressing anna and without waiting for a reply he once more greeted darya alexandrovna and this time he kissed her hand i think the big balcony room 
 oh no too far off better in the corner room we shall see each other more come go up said anna as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her 
 et vous oubliez votre devoir she said to veslovsky who came out too on the steps 
 pardon ai tout plein les poches he answered smiling putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket 
 mais vous venez trop tard she said rubbing her handkerchief on her hand which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar 
 anna turned to dolly you can stay some time for one day only impossible 
 i promised to be back and the children said dolly feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage and because she knew her face must be covered with dust 
 no dolly darling well see come along come along and anna led dolly to her room 
 that room was not the smart guestchamber vronsky had suggested but the one which anna had said dolly would surely excuse and this room for which excuse was needed was more full of luxury than any in which dolly had ever stayed a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad 
 well darling how happy i am anna said sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside dolly tell me about all of you stiva i had only a glimpse of and he cannot tell one about the children how is my favorite tania quite a big girl i expect 
 yes very tall darya alexandrovna answered shortly surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her children we are having a delightful stay at the levins she added 
 oh if i had known said anna that you do not despise me you might have all come to us an old friend and a great friend of you know she added and suddenly she blushed 
 yes but we are all dolly answered in confusion 
 but in my delight talking nonsense the one thing darling is that i am so glad to have you said anna kissing her again you told me yet how and what you think about me and i keep wanting to know but glad you will see me as i am the chief thing i like would be for people to imagine i want to prove anything i want to prove anything i merely want to live to do no one harm but myself i have the right to do that i but it is a big subject and talk over everything properly later now go and dress and send a maid to you

 chapter 
 
 left alone darya alexandrovna with a good eye scanned her room all she had seen in entering the house and walking through it and all she saw now in her room gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern european luxury of which she had only read in english novels but had never seen in russia and in the country everything was new from the new french hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor the bed had a spring mattress and a special sort of bolster and taffeta pillowcases on the small pillows the marble washstand the dressing table the little sofa the tables the bronze clock on the chimney piece the window curtains and the portieres were all new and expensive 
 the smart maid who came in to offer her services with her hair done up high and a gown more fashionable that was as new and expensive as the whole room darya alexandrovna liked her neatness her deferential and obliging manners but she felt ill at ease with her she felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for her she was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home at home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed arsheenes of nainsook at kopecks the yard which was a matter of fifteen roubles besides the cutting out and making and these fifteen roubles had been saved but before the maid she felt if not exactly ashamed at least uncomfortable 
 darya alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when annushka whom she had known for years walked in the smart maid was sent for to go to her mistress and annushka remained with darya alexandrovna 
 annushka was obviously much pleased at that arrival and began to chatter away without a pause dolly observed that she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her position especially as to the love and devotion of the count to anna arkadyevna but dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this 
 i grew up with anna arkadyevna my dearer to me than anything well not for us to judge and to be sure there seems so much love 
 kindly order these things washed for me please darya alexandrovna cut her short 
 certainly two women kept specially for washing small things but most of the done by machinery the count goes into everything himself ah what a husband he would make 
 dolly was glad when anna came in and by her entrance put a stop to gossip 
 anna had put on a very simple batiste gown dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively she knew what it meant and the price at which such simplicity was obtained 
 an old friend said anna of annushka 
 anna was not embarrassed now she was perfectly composed and at ease dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her arrival had made on her and had assumed that superficial careless tone which as it were closed the door on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and intimate meditations were kept 
 well anna and how is your little girl asked dolly 
 annie this was what she called her little daughter anna very well she has got on wonderfully would you like to see her come show her to you we had a terrible bother she began telling her over nurses we had an italian wet nurse a good creature but so stupid we wanted to get rid of her but the baby is so used to her that gone on keeping her still 
 but how have you managed dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have but noticing a sudden frown on face she changed the drift of her question how did you manage have you weaned her yet 
 but anna had understood 
 you mean to ask that you meant to ask about her surname yes that worries alexei she has no name that is a karenina said anna dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting but talk about all that later her face suddenly brightening come show her to you elle est trs gentille she crawls now 
 in the nursery the luxury which had impressed dolly in the whole house struck her still more there were little gocarts ordered from england and appliances for learning to walk and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table purposely constructed for crawling and swings and baths all of special pattern and modern they were all english solid and of good make and obviously very expensive the room was large and very light and lofty 
 when they went in the baby with nothing on but her little smock was sitting in a little elbowchair at the table having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest the baby was being fed and the russian nurserymaid was evidently sharing her meal neither the wet nurse nor the head nurse were there they were in the next room from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer french which was their only means of communication 
 hearing voice a smart tall english nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door hurriedly shaking her fair curls and immediately began to defend herself though anna had not found fault with her at every word anna said the english nurse said hurriedly several times yes my lady 
 the rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair her sturdy red little body with tight skin delighted darya alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger she positively envied the healthy appearance she was delighted too at the crawling not one of her own children had crawled like that when the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind it was wonderfully charming looking round like some little wild animal at the big people with her bright black eyes she smiled unmistakably pleased at their admiring her and holding her legs sideways she pressed vigorously on her arms and rapidly drew her whole back up after and then made another step forward with her little arms 
 but the whole atmosphere of the nursery and especially the english nurse darya alexandrovna did not like at all it was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as that darya alexandrovna could explain to herself how anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing indecorous woman as nurse to her child besides from a few words that were dropped darya alexandrovna saw at once that anna the two nurses and the child had no existence in common and that the visit was something exceptional anna wanted to get the baby her plaything and could not find it 
 most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had anna answered wrong and knew nothing about the two last teeth 
 i sometimes feel sorry as it were superfluous here said anna going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything standing near the doorway it was very different with my first child 
 i expected it to be the other way said darya alexandrovna shyly 
 oh no by the way do you know i saw seriozha said anna screwing up her eyes as though looking at something far away but talk about that later you believe it like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her and she does not know what to begin on first the full dinner is you and the talks i have before me with you which i could never have with anyone else and i know which subject to begin upon first mais je ne vous ferai grace de rien i must have everything out with you oh i ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us she began begin with the ladies princess varvara you know her and i know your opinion and about her stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over auntie katerina pavlovna all true but a woman and i am so grateful to her in peterburg there was a moment when un chaperon was absolutely essential for me then she turned up but really she is she did a great deal to alleviate my position i see you understand all the difficulty of my position there in peterburg she added here perfectly at ease and happy well of that later on though then sviiazhsky the marshal of the district and a very good sort of a man but he wants to get something out of alexei you understand with his property now that we are settled in the country alexei can exercise great influence then tushkevich you have seen him you know admirer now been thrown over and come to see us as alexei says one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be et puis il est comme il faut as princess varvara says then veslovsky you know him a very charming boy she said and a sly smile curved her lips this wild story about him and the levins veslovsky told alexei about it and we believe it il est tres gentil et she said again with the same smile men need occupation and alexei needs a circle so i value all these people we have to have the house lively and gay so that alexei may not long for any novelty then see the steward a german a very good fellow and he understands his work alexei has a very high opinion of him then the doctor a young man not quite a nihilist perhaps but you know he eats with his knife but a very good doctor then the architect une petite cour

 princess varvara gave dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception and began at once explaining to her that she was living with anna because she had always cared more for her than her sister that aunt that had brought anna up and that now when everyone had abandoned anna she thought it her duty to help her in this most difficult period of transition 
 her husband will give her a divorce and then i shall go back to my solitude but now i can be of use and i am doing my duty however difficult it may be for me not like some other people and how sweet it is of you how right of you to have come they live like the best of married couples for god to judge them not for us and biriuzovsky and madame avenieva and nikandrov himself and vassiliev with madame mamonova and liza neptunova did no one say anything about them and it has ended by their being received by everyone and then un intrieur si joli si comme il faut on se reunit le matin au breakfast et puis on se separe everyone does as he pleases till dinnertime dinner at seven stiva did very rightly to send you he needs their support you know that through his mother and brother he can do everything and then they do so much good he tell you about his hospital ce sera admirable everything from paris 
 their conversation was interrupted by anna who had found the men of the party in the billiard room and returned with them to the terrace there was still a long time before the dinner hour it was exquisite weather and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed there were very many methods of passing the time at vozdvizhenskoe and these were all unlike those in use at pokrovskoe 
 une partie de lawn tennis veslovsky proposed with his handsome smile be partners again anna arkadyevna 
 no too hot better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat show darya alexandrovna the riverbanks vronsky proposed

 she saw by face that he wanted something from her she was not mistaken as soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden he looked in the direction anna had taken and having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them he began 
 you guess that i have something i want to say to you he said looking at her with laughing eyes i am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of he took off his hat and taking out his handkerchief wiped his head which was growing bald 
 
 darya alexandrovna made no answer and merely stared at him with dismay when she was left alone with him she suddenly felt afraid his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her 
 the most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to say to her flashed into her brain he is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children and i shall have to refuse or to create a set that will receive anna in moscow or it vassenka veslovsky and his relations with anna or perhaps about kitty that he feels he was to blame all her conjectures were unpleasant but she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her 
 you have so much influence with anna she is so fond of you he said do help me 
 darya alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face which under the linden trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine and then passing into complete shadow again she waited for him to say more but he walked in silence beside her scratching with his cane in the gravel 
 you have come to see us you the only woman of former friends i count princess varvara but i know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal but because understanding all the difficulty of the position you still love her and want to be a help to her have i understood you rightly he asked looking round at her 
 oh yes answered darya alexandrovna putting down her sunshade but 
 no he broke in and unconsciously oblivious of the awkward position in which he was putting his companion he stopped abruptly so that she had to stop short too no one feels more deeply and intensely than i do all the difficulty of position and that you may well understand if you do me the honor of supposing i have any heart i am to blame for that position and that is why i feel it 
 i understand said darya alexandrovna involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this but just because you feel yourself responsible you exaggerate it i am afraid she said her position in the world is difficult i can well understand 
 in the world it is hell he brought out quickly frowning darkly you imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through in peterburg during that fortnight and i beg you to believe it 
 yes but here so long as neither anna nor you want society 
 society he said contemptuously how could i want society 
 so far and it may be so always you are happy and at peace i see in anna that she is happy perfectly happy she has had time to tell me so much already said darya alexandrovna smiling and involuntarily as she said this at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether anna really were happy 
 but vronsky it appeared had no doubts on that score 
 yes yes he said i know that she has revived after all her sufferings she is happy she is happy in the present but i i am afraid of what is before us i beg your pardon you would like to walk on 
 no i mind 
 well then let us sit here 
 darya alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue he stood up facing her 
 i see that she is happy he repeated and the doubt whether she were happy sank more deeply into darya mind but can it last whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question but the die is cast he said passing from russian to french and we are bound together for life we are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred we have a child we may have other children but the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she does not see at present and does not want to see setting her heart at rest after all these sufferings and ordeals and that one can well understand but i help seeing them my daughter is by law not my daughter but i cannot bear this falsity he said with a vigorous gesture of refusal and he looked with gloomy inquiry toward darya alexandrovna 
 she made no answer but simply gazed at him he went on 
 one day a son may be born my son and he will be legally a karenin he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have there will be no real tie between us they will be you will understand the bitterness and horror of this position i have tried to speak of this to anna it irritates her she does not understand and to her i cannot speak plainly of all this now look at another side i am happy happy in her love but i must have occupation i have found occupation and am proud of what i am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army and most certainly i would not change the work i am doing for theirs i am working here settled in my own place and i am happy and contented and we need nothing more to make us happy i love my work here ce pas un on the contrary 
 darya alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused and she did not quite understand this digression but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart of which he could not speak to anna he was now making a clean breast of everything and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same compartment of his intimate meditations as the question of his relations with anna 
 well i will go on he said collecting himself the great thing is that as i work i want to have a conviction that what i am doing will not die with me that i shall have heirs to come after me and this i have not conceive the position of a man who knows that his children the children of the woman he loves will not be his but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing about them it is awful 
 he paused evidently much moved 
 yes indeed i see that but what can anna do queried darya alexandrovna 
 yes that brings me to the object of my conversation he said calming himself with an effort anna can it depends on her even to petition the czar for legitimization a divorce is essential and that depends on anna her husband agreed to a divorce at that time your husband had arranged it completely and now i know he would not refuse it it is only a matter of writing to him he said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire he would not refuse of course he said gloomily it is one of those pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are capable he knows what agony any recollection of him must give her and knowing her he must have a letter from her i can understand that it is agony to her but the matter is of such importance that one must passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment il y va du bonheur et de et de ses enfants i speak of myself though hard for me very hard he said with an expression as though he were threatening someone for its being hard for him and so it is princess that i am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation help me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce 
 yes of course darya alexandrovna said dreamily as she vividly recalled her last interview with alexei alexandrovich yes of course she repeated with decision thinking of anna 
 use your influence with her make her write i like almost unable to speak about this to her 
 very well i will talk to her but how is it she does not think of it herself said darya alexandrovna and for some reason she suddenly at that point recalled strange new habit of her eyes and she remembered that anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon just as though she her eyes to her own life so as not to see everything thought dolly yes indeed for my own sake and for hers i will talk to her dolly said in reply to his expression of gratitude 
 they got up and walked to the house

 chapter 
 
 when anna found dolly at home before her she looked intently in her eyes as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky but she made no inquiry in words 
 i believe dinnertime she said not seen each other at all yet i am reckoning on the evening now i want to go and dress i expect you do too we all got splashed at the buildings 
 dolly went to her room and she felt amused to change her dress was impossible for she had already put on her best dress but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she asked the maid to brush her dress changed her cuffs and rosette and put some lace on her head 
 this is all i can do she said with a smile to anna who came in to her in a third dress again of extreme simplicity 
 yes we are too prim here she said as it were apologizing for her finery alexei is delighted at your visit as he rarely is at anything he has completely lost his heart to you she added not tired 
 there was no time for talking about anything before dinner going into the drawing room they found princess varvara already there and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats the architect wore a coat vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital 
 a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat announced that dinner was ready and the ladies got up vronsky asked sviiazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offered his arm to dolly veslovsky was before tushkevich in offering his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevich with the steward and the doctor walked in alone 
 the dinner the dining room the service the waiting at table the wine and the food were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout the house but seemed even more sumptuous and modern darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household though she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living she could not help scrutinizing every detail and wondering how and by whom it was all done vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviiazhsky and many other people she knew would never have considered this question and would have readily believed what every host tries to make his guests feel that is that all that is in his house has cost him the host no trouble whatever but comes of itself darya alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the breakfast does not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained someone must give earnest attention to its organization and from the glance with which alexei kirillovich scanned the table from the way he nodded to the butler and offered darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself it was evident that it all rested no more upon anna than upon veslovsky she sviiazhsky the princess and veslovsky were equally guests with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them 
 anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation the conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present like the steward and the architect belonging to a completely different world struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation but this difficult conversation anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observed 
 the conversation began about the row tushkevich and veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat and tushkevich began describing the last boat races in peterburg at the yacht club but anna seizing the first pause at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence 
 nikolai ivanich was struck she said meaning sviiazhsky at the progress the new building had made since he was here last but i am there every day and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grows 
 working with his excellency said the architect with a smile he was respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities where one would have to write out sheaves of papers here i call upon the count and in three words we settle the business 
 the american way of doing business said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 yes there they build in a rational fashion 
 the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly brought it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk 
 have you ever seen a reaping machine she said addressing darya alexandrovna we had just ridden over to look at one when we met the first time i ever saw one 
 how do they work asked dolly 
 exactly like scissors a plank and a lot of little scissors like this 
 anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings and began showing how the machine worked it was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining 
 more like little penknives veslovsky said playfully never taking his eyes off her 
 anna gave a just perceptible smile but made no answer it true karl fedorich that just like scissors she said to the steward 
 oh ja answered the german es ist ein ganz einfaches ding and he began to explain the construction of the machine 
 a pity it bind too i saw one at the vienna exhibition which binds with a wire said sviiazhsky they would be more profitable in use 
 es kommt drauf an der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden and the german roused from his taciturnity turned to vronsky das sich ausrechnen erlaucht the german was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in but recollecting that he was at a dinner and observing chilly glance he checked himself zu compliziert macht zu viel pains he concluded 
 wnscht man gains so hat man auch pains said vassenka veslovsky bantering the german he addressed anna again with the same smile 
 cessez she said with playful severity 
 we expected to find you in the fields vassilii semionich she said to the doctor a man have you been there 
 i went there but i evaporated the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness 
 then taken a good constitutional 
 splendid 
 well and how was the old woman i hope not typhus 
 typhus it but not to be found to the best advantage 
 what a pity said anna and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle she turned to her own friends 
 it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna sviiazhsky said jestingly 
 oh no why so said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviiazhsky too this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly 
 but anna knowledge of architecture is marvelous said tushkevich 
 to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna saying yesterday by cramp and plinths said veslovsky have i got it right 
 nothing marvelous about it when one sees and hears so much of it said anna but i dare say you even know what houses are made of 
 darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of playfulness that existed between her and veslovsky but fell in with it against her will 
 vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attached no significance to chattering on the contrary he encouraged his jests 
 come now tell us veslovsky how are the stones held together 
 by cement of course 
 bravo and what is cement 
 oh some sort of paste no putty said veslovsky raising a general laugh 
 the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remained plunged in gloomy silence kept up a conversation that never paused glancing off one subject fastening on another and at times stinging one or the other of the company to the quick once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterward whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant sviiazhsky began talking of levin describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture 
 i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject 
 turkish views in general veslovsky said turning to anna with a smile 
 i defend his opinions darya alexandrovna said flaring up but i can say that a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you though i am not capable of doing so 
 i like him extremely and we are great friends sviiazhsky said smiling mais pardon il est un petit peu toque he maintains for instance that zemstvoes and justices of the peace are all of no use and he is unwilling to take part in anything 
 our russian apathy said vronsky pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us and so we refuse to recognize these duties 
 i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties said darya alexandrovna irritated by tone of superiority 
 for my part pursued vronsky who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation such as i am i am on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have done me thanks to nikolai ivanich he indicated sviiazhsky in electing me an honorary justice of the peace i consider that for me the duty of being present at the session of judging some peasants quarrel about a horse is as important as anything i can do and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council only in that way i can pay for the advantages i enjoy as a landowner unluckily they understand the importance that the big landowners ought to have in the state 
 it was strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table she thought how levin who believed the opposite was just as positive in his opinions at his own table but she loved levin and so she was on his side 
 so we can reckon upon you count for the coming elections said sviiazhsky but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth if you would do me the honor to stop with me 
 i rather agree with your said anna though not quite on the same ground as he she added with a smile afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days just as in the old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing so now doing some sort of public duty alexei has been here now six months and a member i do believe of five or six different public bodies a guardian a justice of the peace a member of the council a juryman an equine something du train que cela va his whole time will be wasted on it and afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies end in being a mere form how many are you a member of nikolai ivanich she turned to sviiazhsky over twenty i fancy 
 anna spoke lightly but irritation could be discerned in her tone darya alexandrovna watching anna and vronsky attentively detected it instantly she noticed too that as she spoke face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression noticing this and that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of peterburg acquaintances and remembering what vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky 
 the dinner the wine the dinner set were all very good but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her it all had the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her 
 after dinner they sat on the terrace then they proceeded to play lawn tennis the players divided into two parties stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet ground darya alexandrovna made an attempt to play but it was a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down with princess varvara and simply looked on at the players her partner tushkevich gave up playing too but the others kept the game up for a long time sviiazhsky and vronsky both played very well and seriously they kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them and without loitering they ran adroitly up to them waited for the rebound and neatly and accurately returned them over the net veslovsky played worse than the others he was too eager but he kept the players lively with his high spirits his laughter and outcries never paused like the other men of the party with the ladies permission he took off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirt sleeves with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory 
 when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night as soon as she closed her eyes she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground 
 during the game darya alexandrovna was not enjoying herself she did not like the light tone of playfulness that was kept up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of people all alone without children playing at a game but to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she joined the game again and pretended to be enjoying it all that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance 
 she had come with the intention of staying two days if all went well but in the evening during the game she made up her mind that she would go home next day the maternal cares and worries which she had so hated on the way now after a day spent without them struck her in quite another light and tempted her back to them 
 when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna went alone to her room took off her dress and began arranging her thin hair for the night she had a great sense of relief 
 it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna would be coming to see her immediately she longed to be alone with her own thoughts

 i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject 
 turkish views in general veslovsky said turning to anna with a smile 
 i defend his opinions darya alexandrovna said flaring up but i can say that a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you though i am not capable of doing so 
 i like him extremely and we are great friends sviiazhsky said smiling mais pardon il est un petit peu toque he maintains for instance that zemstvoes and justices of the peace are all of no use and he is unwilling to take part in anything 
 our russian apathy said vronsky pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us and so we refuse to recognize these duties 
 i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties said darya alexandrovna irritated by tone of superiority 
 for my part pursued vronsky who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation such as i am i am on the contrary extremely grateful for the honor they have done me thanks to nikolai ivanich he indicated sviiazhsky in electing me an honorary justice of the peace i consider that for me the duty of being present at the session of judging some peasants quarrel about a horse is as important as anything i can do and i shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council only in that way i can pay for the advantages i enjoy as a landowner unluckily they understand the importance that the big landowners ought to have in the state 
 it was strange to darya alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table she thought how levin who believed the opposite was just as positive in his opinions at his own table but she loved levin and so she was on his side 
 so we can reckon upon you count for the coming elections said sviiazhsky but you must come a little beforehand so as to be on the spot by the eighth if you would do me the honor to stop with me 
 i rather agree with your said anna though not quite on the same ground as he she added with a smile afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days just as in the old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing so now doing some sort of public duty alexei has been here now six months and a member i do believe of five or six different public bodies a guardian a justice of the peace a member of the council a juryman an equine something du train que cela va his whole time will be wasted on it and afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies end in being a mere form how many are you a member of nikolai ivanich she turned to sviiazhsky over twenty i fancy 
 anna spoke lightly but irritation could be discerned in her tone darya alexandrovna watching anna and vronsky attentively detected it instantly she noticed too that as she spoke face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression noticing this and that princess varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of peterburg acquaintances and remembering what vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between anna and vronsky 
 the dinner the wine the dinner set were all very good but it was all like what darya alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her it all had the same impersonal and constrained character and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her 
 after dinner they sat on the terrace then they proceeded to play lawn tennis the players divided into two parties stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet ground darya alexandrovna made an attempt to play but it was a long time before she could understand the game and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down with princess varvara and simply looked on at the players her partner tushkevich gave up playing too but the others kept the game up for a long time sviiazhsky and vronsky both played very well and seriously they kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them and without loitering they ran adroitly up to them waited for the rebound and neatly and accurately returned them over the net veslovsky played worse than the others he was too eager but he kept the players lively with his high spirits his laughter and outcries never paused like the other men of the party with the ladies permission he took off his coat and his solid comely figure in his white shirt sleeves with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory 
 when darya alexandrovna lay in bed that night as soon as she closed her eyes she saw vassenka veslovsky flying about the croquet ground 
 during the game darya alexandrovna was not enjoying herself she did not like the light tone of playfulness that was kept up all the time between vassenka veslovsky and anna and the unnaturalness altogether of people all alone without children playing at a game but to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow after a rest she joined the game again and pretended to be enjoying it all that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance 
 she had come with the intention of staying two days if all went well but in the evening during the game she made up her mind that she would go home next day the maternal cares and worries which she had so hated on the way now after a day spent without them struck her in quite another light and tempted her back to them 
 when after evening tea and a row by night in the boat darya alexandrovna went alone to her room took off her dress and began arranging her thin hair for the night she had a great sense of relief 
 it was positively disagreeable to her to think that anna would be coming to see her immediately she longed to be alone with her own thoughts

 chapter 
 
 when anna found dolly at home before her she looked intently in her eyes as though questioning her about the talk she had had with vronsky but she made no inquiry in words 
 i believe dinnertime she said not seen each other at all yet i am reckoning on the evening now i want to go and dress i expect you do too we all got splashed at the buildings 
 dolly went to her room and she felt amused to change her dress was impossible for she had already put on her best dress but in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner she asked the maid to brush her dress changed her cuffs and rosette and put some lace on her head 
 this is all i can do she said with a smile to anna who came in to her in a third dress again of extreme simplicity 
 yes we are too prim here she said as it were apologizing for her finery alexei is delighted at your visit as he rarely is at anything he has completely lost his heart to you she added not tired 
 there was no time for talking about anything before dinner going into the drawing room they found princess varvara already there and the gentlemen of the party in black frock coats the architect wore a coat vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest the architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital 
 a stout butler resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat announced that dinner was ready and the ladies got up vronsky asked sviiazhsky to take in anna arkadyevna and himself offered his arm to dolly veslovsky was before tushkevich in offering his arm to princess varvara so that tushkevich with the steward and the doctor walked in alone 
 the dinner the dining room the service the waiting at table the wine and the food were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout the house but seemed even more sumptuous and modern darya alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household though she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living she could not help scrutinizing every detail and wondering how and by whom it was all done vassenka veslovsky her husband and even sviiazhsky and many other people she knew would never have considered this question and would have readily believed what every host tries to make his guests feel that is that all that is in his house has cost him the host no trouble whatever but comes of itself darya alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the breakfast does not come of itself and that therefore where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained someone must give earnest attention to its organization and from the glance with which alexei kirillovich scanned the table from the way he nodded to the butler and offered darya alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself it was evident that it all rested no more upon anna than upon veslovsky she sviiazhsky the princess and veslovsky were equally guests with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them 
 anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation the conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present like the steward and the architect belonging to a completely different world struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation but this difficult conversation anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment as darya alexandrovna observed 
 the conversation began about the row tushkevich and veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat and tushkevich began describing the last boat races in peterburg at the yacht club but anna seizing the first pause at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence 
 nikolai ivanich was struck she said meaning sviiazhsky at the progress the new building had made since he was here last but i am there every day and every day i wonder at the rate at which it grows 
 working with his excellency said the architect with a smile he was respectful and composed though with a sense of his own dignity a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities where one would have to write out sheaves of papers here i call upon the count and in three words we settle the business 
 the american way of doing business said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 yes there they build in a rational fashion 
 the conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the united states but anna quickly brought it round to another topic so as to draw the steward into talk 
 have you ever seen a reaping machine she said addressing darya alexandrovna we had just ridden over to look at one when we met the first time i ever saw one 
 how do they work asked dolly 
 exactly like scissors a plank and a lot of little scissors like this 
 anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings and began showing how the machine worked it was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining 
 more like little penknives veslovsky said playfully never taking his eyes off her 
 anna gave a just perceptible smile but made no answer it true karl fedorich that just like scissors she said to the steward 
 oh ja answered the german es ist ein ganz einfaches ding and he began to explain the construction of the machine 
 a pity it bind too i saw one at the vienna exhibition which binds with a wire said sviiazhsky they would be more profitable in use 
 es kommt drauf an der preis vom draht muss ausgerechnet werden and the german roused from his taciturnity turned to vronsky das sich ausrechnen erlaucht the german was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in but recollecting that he was at a dinner and observing chilly glance he checked himself zu compliziert macht zu viel pains he concluded 
 wnscht man gains so hat man auch pains said vassenka veslovsky bantering the german he addressed anna again with the same smile 
 cessez she said with playful severity 
 we expected to find you in the fields vassilii semionich she said to the doctor a man have you been there 
 i went there but i evaporated the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness 
 then taken a good constitutional 
 splendid 
 well and how was the old woman i hope not typhus 
 typhus it but not to be found to the best advantage 
 what a pity said anna and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle she turned to her own friends 
 it would be a hard task though to construct a machine from your description anna arkadyevna sviiazhsky said jestingly 
 oh no why so said anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by sviiazhsky too this new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on dolly 
 but anna knowledge of architecture is marvelous said tushkevich 
 to be sure i heard anna arkadyevna saying yesterday by cramp and plinths said veslovsky have i got it right 
 nothing marvelous about it when one sees and hears so much of it said anna but i dare say you even know what houses are made of 
 darya alexandrovna saw that anna disliked the tone of playfulness that existed between her and veslovsky but fell in with it against her will 
 vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from levin he obviously attached no significance to chattering on the contrary he encouraged his jests 
 come now tell us veslovsky how are the stones held together 
 by cement of course 
 bravo and what is cement 
 oh some sort of paste no putty said veslovsky raising a general laugh 
 the company at dinner with the exception of the doctor the architect and the steward who remained plunged in gloomy silence kept up a conversation that never paused glancing off one subject fastening on another and at times stinging one or the other of the company to the quick once darya alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterward whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant sviiazhsky began talking of levin describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on russian agriculture 
 i have not the pleasure of knowing this m levin vronsky said smiling but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns or if he has seen and tried any it must have been after a queer fashion some russian imitation not a machine from abroad what sort of views can anyone have on such a subject

 i defend his opinions darya alexandrovna said flaring up but i can say that a highly cultivated man and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you though i am not capable of doing so 
 i like him extremely and we are great friends sviiazhsky said smiling mais pardon il est un petit peu toque he maintains for instance that zemstvoes and justices of the peace are all of no use and he is unwilling to take part in anything 
 our russian apathy said vronsky pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us and so we refuse to recognize these duties 
 i know no man more strict in the performance of his duties said darya alexandrovna irritated by tone of superiority

 chapter 
 
 dolly was just about to go to bed when anna came in to see her attired for the night 
 in the course of the day anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart and every time after a few words she had stopped afterward by ourselves talk about everything got so much i want to tell you she had said 
 now they were by themselves and anna did not know what to talk about she sat in the window looking at dolly and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand and she found nothing at that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already 
 well what of kitty she said with a heavy sigh looking penitently at dolly tell me the truth dolly she angry with me 
 angry oh no said darya alexandrovna smiling 
 but she hates me despises me 
 oh no but you know that sort of thing forgiven 
 yes yes said anna turning away and looking out of the open window but i was not to blame and who is to blame the meaning of being to blame could it have been otherwise what do you think could it possibly have happened otherwise than that you should become the wife of stiva 
 really i know but this is what i want you to tell me 
 yes yes but not finished about kitty is she happy a very fine man they say 
 much more than very fine i know a better man 
 ah how glad i am so glad much more than very fine she repeated 
 dolly smiled 
 but tell me about yourself a great deal to talk about and had a talk with dolly did not know what to call him she felt it awkward to call him either the count or alexei kirillovich 
 with alexei said anna i know what you talked about but i wanted to ask you directly what you think of me of my life 
 how am i to say anything so suddenly i really know 
 no tell me all the same you see my life but you forget that seeing us in the summer when you have come to us and we are not alone but we came here early in the spring lived quite alone and shall be alone again and i desire nothing better but imagine me living alone without him alone and that will be i see by everything that it will often be repeated that he will be half the time away from home she said getting up and sitting down close by dolly of course she interrupted dolly who would have answered of course i try to keep him by force i keep him indeed the races are just coming his horses are running he will go very glad but think of me fancy my position but the use of talking about it she smiled well what did he talk about with you 
 he spoke of what i want to speak about myself and easy for me to be his advocate of whether there is not a possibility whether you could not darya alexandrovna hesitated correct or improve your position you know how i look at it but all the same if possible you should get married 
 divorce you mean said anna do you know the only woman who came to see me in peterburg was betsy tverskaia you know her of course au fond la femme la plus dpravee qui existe she had an intrigue with tushkevich deceiving her husband in the basest way and she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular imagine i would compare i know you darling but i could not help remembering well so what did he say to you she repeated 
 he said that he was unhappy on your account and his own perhaps you will say that egoism but what a legitimate and noble egoism he wants first of all to legitimize his daughter and to be your husband to have a legal right to you 
 what wife what slave can be so utterly a slave as i in my position she put in gloomily 
 the chief thing he desires he desires that you should not suffer 
 impossible well 
 well and the most legitimate desire he wishes that your children should have a name 
 what children anna said not looking at dolly and half closing her eyes 
 annie and those to come 
 he need not trouble on that score i shall have no more children 
 how can you tell that you 
 i shall not because i wish it and in spite of all her emotion anna smiled as she caught the expression of curiosity wonder and horror on face 
 the doctor told me after my illness 
 impossible said dolly opening her eyes wide for here this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in and that one will have to reflect a great great deal upon it 
 this discovery suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her aroused so many ideas reflections and contradictory emotions that she had nothing to say and simply gazed with eyes of wonder at anna this was the very thing she had been dreaming of but now learning that it was possible she was horrified she felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem 
 pas immoral was all she said after a brief pause 
 why so think i have a choice between two alternatives either to be with child that is an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my husband practically my husband anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous 
 yes yes said darya alexandrovna hearing the very arguments she had used to herself and not finding the same force in them as before 
 for you for other people said anna as though divining her thoughts there may be reason to hesitate but for me you must consider i am not his wife he loves me as long as he loves me and how am i to keep his love not like this 
 she moved her white hands in a curve before her waist 
 with extraordinary rapidity as happens during moments of excitement ideas and memories rushed into darya head i she thought did not keep my attraction for stiva he left me for others and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively he deserted her and took another and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way if that is what he looks for he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming and however white and beautiful her bare arms are however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls he will find something better still just as my disgusting pitiful and charming husband does 
 dolly made no answer she merely sighed anna noticed this sigh indicating dissent and she went on in her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them 
 do you say that not right but you must consider she went on you forget my position how can i desire children not speaking of the suffering not afraid of that think only what are my children to be children who will have to bear a name for the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother their father their birth 
 but that is just why a divorce is necessary 
 but anna did not hear her she longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself 
 what is reason given me for if i am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world 
 she looked at dolly but without waiting for a reply she went on 
 i should always feel i had wronged these unhappy children she said if there are none at any rate they are not unhappy while if they are unhappy i alone should be to blame for it 
 these were the very arguments darya alexandrovna had used in her own reflections but she heard them now without understanding them how can one wrong creatures that exist she thought and all at once the idea struck her could it possibly under any circumstances have been better for her favorite grisha if he had never existed and this seemed to her so wild so strange that she shook her head to drive away this tangle of whirling mad ideas 
 no i know not right was all she said with an expression of disgust on her face 
 yes but you forget what you are and what i am and besides that added anna in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of objections seeming still to admit that it was not right forget the chief point that i am not now in the same position as you for you the question is do you desire not to have any more children while for me it is do i desire to have them and a great difference you must see that i desire them in my position 
 darya alexandrovna made no reply she suddenly felt that she had got away from anna so far that there lay between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree and about which it was better not to speak

 dolly was just about to go to bed when anna came in to see her attired for the night 
 in the course of the day anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart and every time after a few words she had stopped afterward by ourselves talk about everything got so much i want to tell you she had said 
 now they were by themselves and anna did not know what to talk about she sat in the window looking at dolly and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand and she found nothing at that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already 
 well what of kitty she said with a heavy sigh looking penitently at dolly tell me the truth dolly she angry with me 
 angry oh no said darya alexandrovna smiling 
 but she hates me despises me 
 oh no but you know that sort of thing forgiven 
 yes yes said anna turning away and looking out of the open window but i was not to blame and who is to blame the meaning of being to blame could it have been otherwise what do you think could it possibly have happened otherwise than that you should become the wife of stiva 
 really i know but this is what i want you to tell me 
 yes yes but not finished about kitty is she happy a very fine man they say 
 much more than very fine i know a better man 
 ah how glad i am so glad much more than very fine she repeated 
 dolly smiled 
 but tell me about yourself a great deal to talk about and had a talk with dolly did not know what to call him she felt it awkward to call him either the count or alexei kirillovich 
 with alexei said anna i know what you talked about but i wanted to ask you directly what you think of me of my life 
 how am i to say anything so suddenly i really know 
 no tell me all the same you see my life but you forget that seeing us in the summer when you have come to us and we are not alone but we came here early in the spring lived quite alone and shall be alone again and i desire nothing better but imagine me living alone without him alone and that will be i see by everything that it will often be repeated that he will be half the time away from home she said getting up and sitting down close by dolly of course she interrupted dolly who would have answered of course i try to keep him by force i keep him indeed the races are just coming his horses are running he will go very glad but think of me fancy my position but the use of talking about it she smiled well what did he talk about with you 
 he spoke of what i want to speak about myself and easy for me to be his advocate of whether there is not a possibility whether you could not darya alexandrovna hesitated correct or improve your position you know how i look at it but all the same if possible you should get married 
 divorce you mean said anna do you know the only woman who came to see me in peterburg was betsy tverskaia you know her of course au fond la femme la plus dpravee qui existe she had an intrigue with tushkevich deceiving her husband in the basest way and she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular imagine i would compare i know you darling but i could not help remembering well so what did he say to you she repeated 
 he said that he was unhappy on your account and his own perhaps you will say that egoism but what a legitimate and noble egoism he wants first of all to legitimize his daughter and to be your husband to have a legal right to you 
 what wife what slave can be so utterly a slave as i in my position she put in gloomily 
 the chief thing he desires he desires that you should not suffer 
 impossible well 
 well and the most legitimate desire he wishes that your children should have a name 
 what children anna said not looking at dolly and half closing her eyes 
 annie and those to come 
 he need not trouble on that score i shall have no more children 
 how can you tell that you 
 i shall not because i wish it and in spite of all her emotion anna smiled as she caught the expression of curiosity wonder and horror on face 
 the doctor told me after my illness 
 impossible said dolly opening her eyes wide for here this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in and that one will have to reflect a great great deal upon it 
 this discovery suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her aroused so many ideas reflections and contradictory emotions that she had nothing to say and simply gazed with eyes of wonder at anna this was the very thing she had been dreaming of but now learning that it was possible she was horrified she felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem 
 pas immoral was all she said after a brief pause 
 why so think i have a choice between two alternatives either to be with child that is an invalid or to be the friend and companion of my husband practically my husband anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous 
 yes yes said darya alexandrovna hearing the very arguments she had used to herself and not finding the same force in them as before 
 for you for other people said anna as though divining her thoughts there may be reason to hesitate but for me you must consider i am not his wife he loves me as long as he loves me and how am i to keep his love not like this 
 she moved her white hands in a curve before her waist 
 with extraordinary rapidity as happens during moments of excitement ideas and memories rushed into darya head i she thought did not keep my attraction for stiva he left me for others and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively he deserted her and took another and can anna attract and keep count vronsky in that way if that is what he looks for he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming and however white and beautiful her bare arms are however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls he will find something better still just as my disgusting pitiful and charming husband does 
 dolly made no answer she merely sighed anna noticed this sigh indicating dissent and she went on in her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them 
 do you say that not right but you must consider she went on you forget my position how can i desire children not speaking of the suffering not afraid of that think only what are my children to be children who will have to bear a name for the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother their father their birth 
 but that is just why a divorce is necessary 
 but anna did not hear her she longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself

 then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible said dolly 
 yes if possible said anna speaking all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful 
 surely you mean a divorce is impossible i was told your husband had consented to it 
 dolly i want to talk about that 
 oh we then darya alexandrovna hastened to say noticing the expression of suffering on face all i see is that you take too gloomy a view of things 
 i not at all very satisfied and happy you see je fais passions veslovsky 
 yes to tell the truth i like tone said darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject 
 oh nonsense it amuses alexei and all but a boy and quite under control you know i turn him as i please just as it might be with your grisha dolly she suddenly changed the subject you say i take too gloomy a view of things you understand too awful i try not to take any view of it at all 
 but i think you ought to you ought to do all you can 
 but what can i do nothing you tell me to marry alexei and say i think about it i think about it she repeated and a flush rose into her face she got up straightening her chest and sighed heavily with her light step she began pacing up and down the room stopping now and then i think of it not a day not an hour passes that i think of it and blame myself for what i think because thinking of that may drive me mad drive me mad she repeated when i think of it i sleep without morphine but never mind let us talk quietly they tell me divorce in the first place he give me a divorce under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now 
 darya alexandrovna sitting erect on a chair turned her head following anna with a face of sympathetic suffering 
 you ought to make the attempt she said softly 
 suppose i make the attempt what does it mean she said evidently giving utterance to a thought a thousand times thought over and learned by heart it means that i hating him but still recognizing that i have wronged him and i consider him magnanimous that i humiliate myself to write to him well suppose i make the effort i do it either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent well i have received his consent say anna was at that moment at the farthest end of the room and she stopped there doing something to the curtain at the window i receive his consent but my my son they give him up to me he will grow up despising me with his father whom abandoned do you see i love equally i think but both more than myself two beings seriozha and alexei 
 she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly with her arms pressed tightly across her chest in her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad she bent her head and with shining wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shaking all over with emotion 
 it is only those two beings whom i love and one excludes the other i have them together and the only thing i want and since i have that i care about the rest i care about anything anything and it will end one way or another and so i i like to talk of it so blame me judge me for anything you with your pure heart understand all that suffering 
 she went up sat down beside dolly and with a guilty look peeped into her face and took her hand 
 what are you thinking what are you thinking about me despise me i deserve contempt simply unhappy if anyone is unhappy i am she uttered and turning away she burst into tears 
 left alone dolly said her prayers and went to bed she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her but now she could not force herself to think of her the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back the next day 
 anna meantime went back to her boudoir took a wineglass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine of which the principal ingredient was morphine after drinking it off and sitting still a little while she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind 
 when she went into the bedroom vronsky looked intently at her he was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew staying so long in room she must have had with her but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect him he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord but she only said 
 i am so glad you like dolly you do you 
 oh known her a long while very goodhearted i suppose mais excessivement still very glad to see her 
 he took hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes 
 misinterpreting the look she smiled to him 
 next morning in spite of the protests of her hosts darya alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey coachman in his by no means new coat and shabby hat with his horses and his carriage with the patched mudguards drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach 
 darya alexandrovna disliked taking leave of princess varvara and the gentlemen of the party after a day spent together both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together and that it was better for them not to meet only anna was sad she knew that now after departure no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation it hurt her to stir up these feelings but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul and that that part of her soul would quickly grow weedy in the life she was leading 
 as she drove out into the open country darya alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at when suddenly the coachman philip expressed himself unasked 
 rolling in wealth they may be but three pots of oats was all they gave us everything cleared up till there a grain left by what are three pots a mere mouthful and oats now you could get from innkeepers for kopecks at our place no fear all comers may have as much as they can eat 
 the a screw put in the countinghouse clerk 
 well did you like their horses asked dolly 
 the horses no two opinions about them and the food was good but it seemed to me sort of dreary there darya alexandrovna i know what you thought he said turning his handsome face to her 
 i thought so too well shall we get home by evening 
 eh we must 
 on reaching home and finding everyone entirely safe and particularly charming darya alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them about her arrival her warm reception about the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys lived and about their recreations and she would not allow a word to be said against them 
 one has to know anna and vronsky i have got to know him better now to see how fine they are and how touching she said speaking now with perfect sincerity and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there

 left alone dolly said her prayers and went to bed she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her but now she could not force herself to think of her the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back the next day 
 anna meantime went back to her boudoir took a wineglass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine of which the principal ingredient was morphine after drinking it off and sitting still a little while she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind 
 when she went into the bedroom vronsky looked intently at her he was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew staying so long in room she must have had with her but in her expression of restrained excitement and of a sort of reserve he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it the consciousness of it and the desire that it should affect him he did not want to ask her what they had been talking of but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord but she only said 
 i am so glad you like dolly you do you 
 oh known her a long while very goodhearted i suppose mais excessivement still very glad to see her 
 he took hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes 
 misinterpreting the look she smiled to him 
 next morning in spite of the protests of her hosts darya alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey coachman in his by no means new coat and shabby hat with his horses and his carriage with the patched mudguards drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach 
 darya alexandrovna disliked taking leave of princess varvara and the gentlemen of the party after a day spent together both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together and that it was better for them not to meet only anna was sad she knew that now after departure no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation it hurt her to stir up these feelings but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul and that that part of her soul would quickly grow weedy in the life she was leading 
 as she drove out into the open country darya alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at when suddenly the coachman philip expressed himself unasked 
 rolling in wealth they may be but three pots of oats was all they gave us everything cleared up till there a grain left by what are three pots a mere mouthful and oats now you could get from innkeepers for kopecks at our place no fear all comers may have as much as they can eat 
 the a screw put in the countinghouse clerk 
 well did you like their horses asked dolly 
 the horses no two opinions about them and the food was good but it seemed to me sort of dreary there darya alexandrovna i know what you thought he said turning his handsome face to her 
 i thought so too well shall we get home by evening 
 eh we must 
 on reaching home and finding everyone entirely safe and particularly charming darya alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them about her arrival her warm reception about the luxury and good taste in which the vronskys lived and about their recreations and she would not allow a word to be said against them 
 one has to know anna and vronsky i have got to know him better now to see how fine they are and how touching she said speaking now with perfect sincerity and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there

 then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position if possible said dolly 
 yes if possible said anna speaking all at once in an utterly different tone subdued and mournful 
 surely you mean a divorce is impossible i was told your husband had consented to it 
 dolly i want to talk about that 
 oh we then darya alexandrovna hastened to say noticing the expression of suffering on face all i see is that you take too gloomy a view of things 
 i not at all very satisfied and happy you see je fais passions veslovsky 
 yes to tell the truth i like tone said darya alexandrovna anxious to change the subject 
 oh nonsense it amuses alexei and all but a boy and quite under control you know i turn him as i please just as it might be with your grisha dolly she suddenly changed the subject you say i take too gloomy a view of things you understand too awful i try not to take any view of it at all 
 but i think you ought to you ought to do all you can 
 but what can i do nothing you tell me to marry alexei and say i think about it i think about it she repeated and a flush rose into her face she got up straightening her chest and sighed heavily with her light step she began pacing up and down the room stopping now and then i think of it not a day not an hour passes that i think of it and blame myself for what i think because thinking of that may drive me mad drive me mad she repeated when i think of it i sleep without morphine but never mind let us talk quietly they tell me divorce in the first place he give me a divorce under the influence of countess lidia ivanovna now 
 darya alexandrovna sitting erect on a chair turned her head following anna with a face of sympathetic suffering 
 you ought to make the attempt she said softly 
 suppose i make the attempt what does it mean she said evidently giving utterance to a thought a thousand times thought over and learned by heart it means that i hating him but still recognizing that i have wronged him and i consider him magnanimous that i humiliate myself to write to him well suppose i make the effort i do it either i receive a humiliating refusal or consent well i have received his consent say anna was at that moment at the farthest end of the room and she stopped there doing something to the curtain at the window i receive his consent but my my son they give him up to me he will grow up despising me with his father whom abandoned do you see i love equally i think but both more than myself two beings seriozha and alexei 
 she came out into the middle of the room and stood facing dolly with her arms pressed tightly across her chest in her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad she bent her head and with shining wet eyes looked from under her brows at dolly a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap shaking all over with emotion 
 it is only those two beings whom i love and one excludes the other i have them together and the only thing i want and since i have that i care about the rest i care about anything anything and it will end one way or another and so i i like to talk of it so blame me judge me for anything you with your pure heart understand all that suffering 
 she went up sat down beside dolly and with a guilty look peeped into her face and took her hand 
 what are you thinking what are you thinking about me despise me i deserve contempt simply unhappy if anyone is unhappy i am she uttered and turning away she burst into tears 
 left alone dolly said her prayers and went to bed she had felt for anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her but now she could not force herself to think of her the memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her with a sort of new brilliance that world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back the next day

 vronsky and anna spent the whole summer and part of the autumn in the country living in just the same condition and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce it was a decided thing between them that they should not go away anywhere but both felt the longer they lived alone especially in the autumn and without guests in the house that they could not stand this existence and that they would have to change it 
 their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired they had the fullest abundance of everything they had a child and both had occupation anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when they had no visitors and she did a great deal of reading both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion she ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and journals she received and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion moreover every subject that was of interest to vronsky she studied in books and special journals so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture sometimes even with questions relating to horse breeding or sport he was amazed at her knowledge her memory and at first was disposed to doubt it to ask for confirmation of her facts and she would find what he asked for in some book and show it to him

 in october there were the provincial nobility elections in the kashinsky province where were the estates of vronsky sviiazhsky koznishev oblonsky and a small part of land 
 these elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them and also from the people taking part in them there had been a great deal of talk about these elections and great preparations were being made for them persons who never attended the elections were coming from moscow from peterburg and from abroad to attend these

 in september levin moved to moscow for confinement he had spent a whole month in moscow with nothing to do when sergei ivanovich who had property in the kashinsky province and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections made ready to set off to the elections he invited his brother who had a vote in the selezniovsky district to come with him levin had moreover to transact in kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister who was abroad

 levin had been five days in kashin visiting the assembly each day and busily engaged about his business which still dragged on the district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship the other matter the receipt of the sums due was also met by difficulties after long negotiations over the lifting of the prohibition the money was at last ready to be paid but the notary a most obliging person could not hand over the order because it must have the signature of the president and the president though he had not given over his duties to a deputy was at the elections all these worrying negotiations this endless going from place to place and talking with pleasant and excellent people who quite saw the unpleasantness of the position but were powerless to assist him all these efforts that yielded no result led to a feeling of misery in levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force he felt this frequently as he talked to his exceedingly solicitor this solicitor did it seemed everything possible and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties i tell you what you might try he said more than once go to and and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything but he would add immediately mean some delay anyway but you might try it and levin did try and did go everyone was kind and civil but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end and again to bar the way what was particularly trying was that levin could not make out with whom he was struggling to whose interest it was that his business should not be done that no one seemed to know the solicitor certainly did not know if levin could have understood why just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him but in the case of the hindrances that confronted him in his business no one could explain why they existed 
 but levin had changed a good deal since his marriage he was patient and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it and that most likely it must be so and he tried not to resent it 
 in attending the elections too and taking part in them he tried now not to judge not to fall foul of them but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected since his marriage there had been revealed to levin so many new and serious aspects of life which had previously through his frivolous attitude to them seemed of no importance that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance 
 sergei ivanovich explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed radical change at the elections the marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions the guardianship of wards the very department which was giving levin so much trouble just now the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province the high schools for girls for boys and military and primary instruction on the new statute and finally the zemstvo the marshal of the province snetkov was a nobleman of the old school dissipating an immense fortune a goodhearted man honest after his own fashion but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days he always took in every question the side of the nobility he was positively antagonistic to the spread of primary education and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the zemstvo which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance what was needed was to put in his place a fresh capable perfectly modern man of contemporary ideas and to frame their policy so as to derive from the rights conferred upon the nobles not as the nobility but as an element of the zemstvo all the benefits of that could possibly be derived from them in the wealthy kashinsky province which always took the lead of other provinces in everything there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy once carried through properly there might serve as a model for other provinces for all russia and hence the whole question was of the greatest importance it was proposed to elect as marshal in place of snetkov either sviiazhsky or better still neviedovsky a former university professor a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of sergei ivanovich 
 the meeting was opened by the governor who made a speech to the nobles urging them to elect the public functionaries not from regard for persons but for the service and welfare of the native country and hoping that the honorable nobility of the kashinsky province would as at all former elections hold their duty as sacred and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch 
 when he had finished his speech the governor walked out of the hall and the noblemen noisily and eagerly some even enthusiastically followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province levin anxious to see into everything and not miss anything also stood there in the crowd and heard the governor say please tell marya ivanovna my wife is very sorry she could not visit the charity school and thereupon the nobles in high good humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral 
 in the cathedral levin lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the dean vowed with the most awesome oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do church services always affected levin and as he uttered the words i kiss the cross and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same he felt touched 
 on the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the high school for girls of no importance whatever as sergei ivanovich explained and levin busy seeing after his own affairs did not attend the meetings on the fourth day the auditing of the accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province and then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old the committee which had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order the marshal of the province got up thanked the nobility for their confidence and shed tears the nobles gave him a loud welcome and shook hands with him but at that instant a nobleman of sergei party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province one of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this then a small gentleman very but very venomous began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission and sergei ivanovich began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not and he developed this dilemma in detail sergei ivanovich was answered by the talker of the opposite party then sviiazhsky spoke and then the venomous gentleman again the discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long especially as when he asked sergei ivanovich whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated sergei ivanovich answered

 the sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province the rooms large and small were full of nobleman in all sorts of uniforms many had come only for that day men who had not seen each other for years some from the crimea some from peterburg some from abroad met in the rooms of the hall of nobility there was much discussion around the province table under the portrait of the czar 
 the nobles both in the larger and in the smaller rooms grouped themselves in camps and from their hostile and suspicious glances from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group and from the way that some whispering together retreated to the farther corridor it was evident that each side had secrets from the other in appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes the old and the new the old were for the most part either in the old uniform of the nobility buttoned up closely with spurs and hats or in their own special naval cavalry infantry uniforms earned by their former service the uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the way with small puffs on their shoulders they were unmistakably tight and short in the waists as though their wearers had grown out of them the younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders unbuttoned over white waistcoats or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered laurel leaves of justices of the peace to the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd 
 but the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties some of the young men as levin observed belonged to the old party and some of the very oldest noblemen on the contrary were whispering with sviiazhsky and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party 
 levin stood in the smaller room where they were smoking and taking light refreshments close to his own friends and listening to what they were saying he vainly exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said sergei ivanovich was the center round which the others grouped themselves he was listening at that moment to sviiazhsky and khliustov the marshal of another district who belonged to their party khliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask snetkov to be a candidate while sviiazhsky was persuading him to do so and sergei ivanovich was approving of the plan levin could not make out why the opposition had to ask the marshal to be a candidate when they wanted to supersede him 
 stepan arkadyevich who had just been drinking and taking some snack lunch came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste 
 we are placing our forces he said pulling out his side whiskers sergei ivanovich 
 and listening to the conversation he supported contention 
 one enough and obviously of the opposition he said words evidently intelligible to all except levin 
 why kostia you it seems get the taste for these affairs too he added turning to levin and drawing his arm through his levin would have been glad indeed to get the taste for these affairs but could not make out what the point was and retreating a few steps from the speakers he explained to stepan arkadyevich his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to be a candidate 
 o sancta simplicitas said stepan arkadyevich and briefly and clearly he explained it to levin 
 if as at previous elections all the districts asked the marshal of the province to be a candidate then he would be elected without a ballot that must not be now eight districts had agreed to call upon him if two refused to do so snetkov might decline the candidacy entirely and then the old party might choose another of their party which would throw them completely out in their reckoning but if only one district did not call upon him to be a candidate snetkov would let himself be balloted for they were even some of them going to vote for him and purposely to let him get a good many votes so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent and when a candidate of the other side was put up they too might give him some votes levin understood to some extent but not fully and would have put a few more questions when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved toward the big room 
 what is it eh whom proxy whose what they pass him no proxy they let fliorov in eh because of the charge against him why at this rate they admit anyone a swindle the law levin heard exclamations on all sides and he moved into the big room together with the others all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something squeezed by the crowding noblemen he drew near the high table where the marshal of the province sviiazhsky and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something

 the nobles both in the larger and in the smaller rooms grouped themselves in camps and from their hostile and suspicious glances from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group and from the way that some whispering together retreated to the farther corridor it was evident that each side had secrets from the other in appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes the old and the new the old were for the most part either in the old uniform of the nobility buttoned up closely with spurs and hats or in their own special naval cavalry infantry uniforms earned by their former service the uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the way with small puffs on their shoulders they were unmistakably tight and short in the waists as though their wearers had grown out of them the younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders unbuttoned over white waistcoats or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered laurel leaves of justices of the peace to the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd 
 but the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties some of the young men as levin observed belonged to the old party and some of the very oldest noblemen on the contrary were whispering with sviiazhsky and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party 
 levin stood in the smaller room where they were smoking and taking light refreshments close to his own friends and listening to what they were saying he vainly exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said sergei ivanovich was the center round which the others grouped themselves he was listening at that moment to sviiazhsky and khliustov the marshal of another district who belonged to their party khliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask snetkov to be a candidate while sviiazhsky was persuading him to do so and sergei ivanovich was approving of the plan levin could not make out why the opposition had to ask the marshal to be a candidate when they wanted to supersede him

 levin was standing rather far off a nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side and another whose thick boots were creaking prevented him from hearing distinctly he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly then the shrill voice of the venomous gentleman and then the voice of sviiazhsky they were disputing as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words liable to be called up for trial 
 the crowd parted to make way for sergei ivanovich approaching the table sergei ivanovich waiting till the venomous gentleman had finished speaking said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself and asked the secretary to find the act the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot 
 sergei ivanovich read the act and began to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout landowner with dyed mustache in a tight uniform that made the back of his neck bulge up interrupted him he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly 
 a ballot put it to the vote no need for more talking 
 then several voices began to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring getting more and more exasperated shouted more and more loudly but it was impossible to make out what he said 
 he was shouting for the very course sergei ivanovich had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order 
 a ballot a ballot whoever is a nobleman understands we shed our blood for our country the confidence of the monarch no checking of the accounts of the marshal not a cashier but not the point votes please what vileness shouted furious and violent voices on all sides looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words they expressed the most implacable hatred levin did not in the least understand what it was all about and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fliorov should be put to the vote he forgot as sergei ivanovich explained to him afterward this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure right to vote that to secure the recognition of right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act 
 and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one wants to be of use in public life concluded sergei ivanovich but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar seeing the waiters busy washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wineglasses seeing their alert and vivacious faces levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air he began walking up and down looking with pleasure at the waiters he particularly liked the way one waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold napkins properly levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter when the secretary of the court of wardship a little old man whose speciality it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic drew him away 
 please come konstantin dmitrievich he said your looking for you they are voting on the legal point 
 levin walked into the room received a white ball and followed his brother sergei ivanovich to the table where sviiazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it sergei ivanovich put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and making room for levin stopped levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergei ivanovich with the question where am i to put it he asked this softly at a moment when there was talking going on near so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard but the persons speaking paused and his improper question was overheard sergei ivanovich frowned 
 that is a matter for each own decision he said severely 
 several people smiled levin crimsoned hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand in too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background 
 a and fo admission against sang out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r then there was a laugh a button and two hazelnuts were found in the box the nobleman was allowed the right to vote and the new party had conquered 
 but the old party did not consider themselves conquered levin heard that they were asking snetkov to be candidate and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal who was saying something levin went nearer in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service several times he repeated the words i have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith i value your goodness and thank you and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him and went out of the room whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him from his love for the nobility or from the strain of the position he was placed in feeling himself surrounded by enemies his emotion infected the assembly the majority were touched and levin felt a tenderness for snetkov 
 in the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against levin 
 beg pardon excuse me please he said as to a stranger but recognizing levin he smiled timidly it seemed to levin that he would have liked to say something but could not speak for emotion his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses and white trousers striped with galloons as he moved hurriedly along reminded levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil plight this expression on the face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his guardianship business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kindhearted fatherly man the big house with the old family furniture the rather slovenly far from stylish but respectful footmen unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master the stout wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl petting her pretty grandchild her daughter the young son a high school boy coming home from school and greeting his father by kissing his big hand the genuine cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin this old man was a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he longed to say something pleasant to him 
 so our marshal again he said 
 not likely said the marshal looking round with a scared expression old if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve 
 and the marshal disappeared through a side door 
 the most solemn moment was at hand they were to proceed immediately to the election the leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers 
 the discussion upon fliorov had given the new party not only vote but had also gained time for them so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been relieved of his uniform 
 on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about fliorov to send some of their men in a cab to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting

 beg pardon excuse me please he said as to a stranger but recognizing levin he smiled timidly it seemed to levin that he would have liked to say something but could not speak for emotion his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses and white trousers striped with galloons as he moved hurriedly along reminded levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil plight this expression on the face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his guardianship business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kindhearted fatherly man the big house with the old family furniture the rather slovenly far from stylish but respectful footmen unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master the stout wife in a cap with lace and a turkish shawl petting her pretty grandchild her daughter the young son a high school boy coming home from school and greeting his father by kissing his big hand the genuine cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in levin this old man was a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he longed to say something pleasant to him 
 so our marshal again he said 
 not likely said the marshal looking round with a scared expression old if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve 
 and the marshal disappeared through a side door 
 the most solemn moment was at hand they were to proceed immediately to the election the leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers 
 the discussion upon fliorov had given the new party not only vote but had also gained time for them so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been relieved of his uniform 
 on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about fliorov to send some of their men in a cab to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting 
 brought one after bringing him to by throwing water over him said the landowner who had gone on this errand to sviiazhsky never mind do

 levin was standing rather far off a nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side and another whose thick boots were creaking prevented him from hearing distinctly he could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly then the shrill voice of the venomous gentleman and then the voice of sviiazhsky they were disputing as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words liable to be called up for trial 
 the crowd parted to make way for sergei ivanovich approaching the table sergei ivanovich waiting till the venomous gentleman had finished speaking said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself and asked the secretary to find the act the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot 
 sergei ivanovich read the act and began to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout landowner with dyed mustache in a tight uniform that made the back of his neck bulge up interrupted him he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly 
 a ballot put it to the vote no need for more talking 
 then several voices began to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring getting more and more exasperated shouted more and more loudly but it was impossible to make out what he said 
 he was shouting for the very course sergei ivanovich had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order 
 a ballot a ballot whoever is a nobleman understands we shed our blood for our country the confidence of the monarch no checking of the accounts of the marshal not a cashier but not the point votes please what vileness shouted furious and violent voices on all sides looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words they expressed the most implacable hatred levin did not in the least understand what it was all about and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fliorov should be put to the vote he forgot as sergei ivanovich explained to him afterward this syllogism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure right to vote that to secure the recognition of right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act 
 and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one wants to be of use in public life concluded sergei ivanovich but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar seeing the waiters busy washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wineglasses seeing their alert and vivacious faces levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air he began walking up and down looking with pleasure at the waiters he particularly liked the way one waiter who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them was teaching them how to fold napkins properly levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter when the secretary of the court of wardship a little old man whose speciality it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic drew him away 
 please come konstantin dmitrievich he said your looking for you they are voting on the legal point 
 levin walked into the room received a white ball and followed his brother sergei ivanovich to the table where sviiazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it sergei ivanovich put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and making room for levin stopped levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergei ivanovich with the question where am i to put it he asked this softly at a moment when there was talking going on near so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard but the persons speaking paused and his improper question was overheard sergei ivanovich frowned 
 that is a matter for each own decision he said severely 
 several people smiled levin crimsoned hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand in too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background 
 a and fo admission against sang out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter r then there was a laugh a button and two hazelnuts were found in the box the nobleman was allowed the right to vote and the new party had conquered 
 but the old party did not consider themselves conquered levin heard that they were asking snetkov to be candidate and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal who was saying something levin went nearer in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service several times he repeated the words i have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith i value your goodness and thank you and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him and went out of the room whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him from his love for the nobility or from the strain of the position he was placed in feeling himself surrounded by enemies his emotion infected the assembly the majority were touched and levin felt a tenderness for snetkov

 the narrow room in which they were smoking and taking refreshment was full of noblemen the excitement grew more intense and every face betrayed some uneasiness the excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party who knew every detail and had reckoned up every vote they were the generals organizing the approaching battle the rest like the rank and file before an engagement though they were getting ready for the fight sought for other distractions in the interval some were lunching standing at the bar or sitting at the table others were walking up and down the long room smoking cigarettes and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while 
 levin did not care to eat and he was not a smoker he did not want to join his own friends that is sergei ivanovich stepan arkadyevich sviiazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his uniform was standing with them in eager conversation levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day and he had studiously avoided him not caring to greet him he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him he felt depressed especially because everyone else was as he saw eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform who sat beside him had no interest in it and nothing to do 
 such a blackguard i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it he collect it in three years he heard vigorously uttered by a short country gentleman who had pomaded hair hanging over his embroidered collar and new boots obviously put on for the occasion with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke casting a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turned his back 
 yes a dirty business no denying another puny landowner assented in a high voice 
 next a whole crowd of country gentlemen surrounding a stout general hurriedly came near levin these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard 
 how dare he say i had his breeches stolen pawned them for drink i expect damn the fellow prince indeed better not say it swinish 
 but excuse me they take their stand on the act was being said in another group the wife must be registered as a noble 
 oh damn your acts i speak from my heart all gentlemen we have trust in us 
 shall we go on your excellency fine champagne 
 another group was following a nobleman who was shouting something in a loud voice it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen 
 i always advised marya semionovna to let for a fair rent for she can never save a profit he heard a pleasant voice say the speaker was a country gentleman with white mustache wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer it was the very landowner levin had met at he knew him at once the landowner too stared at levin and they exchanged greetings 
 very glad to see you to be sure i remember you very well last year at our district nikolai 
 well and how is your land doing asked levin 
 oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that it must be thus and how do you come to be in our province he asked come to take part in our coup he said confidently pronouncing the french words with a bad accent 
 all here gentlemen of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry he pointed to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevich in white trousers and his court uniform walking by with a general 
 i ought to own that i very well understand the drift of the provincial elections said levin 
 the landowner looked at him 
 why what is there to understand no meaning in it at all a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia just look the very uniforms tell you that an assembly of justices of the peace permanent members of the boards and so on but not of noblemen 
 then why do you come asked levin 
 from habit nothing else then too one must keep up connections a moral obligation of a sort and then to tell the truth there are own interests my wants to run as a permanent member not rich people and he must be brought forward these gentlemen now what do they come for he said pointing to the venomous gentleman who was talking at the high table 
 the new generation of nobility 
 new it may be but nobility it landed proprietors but the landowners as noblemen cutting their own throats 
 but you say an institution served its time 
 that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully snetkov now we may be of use or we may not but the growth of a thousand years if laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there a tree stood for centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree you grow him again in a year he said cautiously and he immediately changed the conversation well and how is your estate doing 
 oh not very well i make about five per cent 
 yes but you reckon your own work you worth something too tell you my own case before i took to seeing after the land i had a salary of three thousand roubles from the service now i do more work than i did in the service and like you i get five per cent on the land and thank god for that but work is thrown in for nothing 
 then why do you do it if a clear loss 
 oh well one does it what would you have habit and one knows as it should be and more the landowner went on leaning on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it no doubt be a savant so be no one to keep it up and yet one does it here this year planted an orchard 
 yes yes said levin perfectly true i always feel no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one does it a sort of duty one feels to the land 
 but i tell you what the landowner pursued a neighbor of mine a merchant was at my place we walked about the fields and the park no said he stepan vassilyevich well looked after but your neglected but as a fact well kept up to my thinking cut down the linden trees only do it when running sap a thousand lindens and each would make two good bundles of bast and nowadays that worth something and cut down the lot of the linden shells 
 and with what he made buy up livestock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out to the peasants levin added smiling he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations and make his fortune but you and i must thank god if we keep what got and leave it to our children 
 married heard said the landowner 
 yes levin answered with proud satisfaction yes all this is rather strange he went on so we live on without any reckoning as though we were the vestals of antiquity set to guard a sacred fire or something 
 the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches 
 there are some among us too like our friend nikolai ivanovich or count vronsky settled here lately they try to set up an agronomic industry but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital 
 but why is it we do like the merchants why we cut down our parks for bast said levin returning to a thought that had struck him 
 why as you said to guard the fire besides not work for a nobleman and our work as noblemen done here at the elections but yonder each in his own nook a class instinct too of what one ought and to do there are the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can however bad the land is work it without a reckoning too at a simple loss 
 just as we do said levin very very glad to have met you he added seeing sviiazhsky approaching him 
 and here met for the first time since we met at your place said the landowner to sviiazhsky and had a good talk too 
 well have you been attacking the new order of things said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 that bound to do 
 been relieving your feelings

 levin did not care to eat and he was not a smoker he did not want to join his own friends that is sergei ivanovich stepan arkadyevich sviiazhsky and the rest because vronsky in his uniform was standing with them in eager conversation levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day and he had studiously avoided him not caring to greet him he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him he felt depressed especially because everyone else was as he saw eager anxious and interested and he alone with an old toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform who sat beside him had no interest in it and nothing to do 
 such a blackguard i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it he collect it in three years he heard vigorously uttered by a short country gentleman who had pomaded hair hanging over his embroidered collar and new boots obviously put on for the occasion with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke casting a displeased glance at levin this gentleman sharply turned his back 
 yes a dirty business no denying another puny landowner assented in a high voice 
 next a whole crowd of country gentlemen surrounding a stout general hurriedly came near levin these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard 
 how dare he say i had his breeches stolen pawned them for drink i expect damn the fellow prince indeed better not say it swinish 
 but excuse me they take their stand on the act was being said in another group the wife must be registered as a noble 
 oh damn your acts i speak from my heart all gentlemen we have trust in us 
 shall we go on your excellency fine champagne 
 another group was following a nobleman who was shouting something in a loud voice it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen 
 i always advised marya semionovna to let for a fair rent for she can never save a profit he heard a pleasant voice say the speaker was a country gentleman with white mustache wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer it was the very landowner levin had met at he knew him at once the landowner too stared at levin and they exchanged greetings 
 very glad to see you to be sure i remember you very well last year at our district nikolai 
 well and how is your land doing asked levin 
 oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that it must be thus and how do you come to be in our province he asked come to take part in our coup he said confidently pronouncing the french words with a bad accent 
 all here gentlemen of the bedchamber and everything short of the ministry he pointed to the imposing figure of stepan arkadyevich in white trousers and his court uniform walking by with a general 
 i ought to own that i very well understand the drift of the provincial elections said levin 
 the landowner looked at him 
 why what is there to understand no meaning in it at all a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia just look the very uniforms tell you that an assembly of justices of the peace permanent members of the boards and so on but not of noblemen 
 then why do you come asked levin 
 from habit nothing else then too one must keep up connections a moral obligation of a sort and then to tell the truth there are own interests my wants to run as a permanent member not rich people and he must be brought forward these gentlemen now what do they come for he said pointing to the venomous gentleman who was talking at the high table 
 the new generation of nobility 
 new it may be but nobility it landed proprietors but the landowners as noblemen cutting their own throats 
 but you say an institution served its time 
 that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully snetkov now we may be of use or we may not but the growth of a thousand years if laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there a tree stood for centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree you grow him again in a year he said cautiously and he immediately changed the conversation well and how is your estate doing 
 oh not very well i make about five per cent 
 yes but you reckon your own work you worth something too tell you my own case before i took to seeing after the land i had a salary of three thousand roubles from the service now i do more work than i did in the service and like you i get five per cent on the land and thank god for that but work is thrown in for nothing 
 then why do you do it if a clear loss 
 oh well one does it what would you have habit and one knows as it should be and more the landowner went on leaning on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it no doubt be a savant so be no one to keep it up and yet one does it here this year planted an orchard 
 yes yes said levin perfectly true i always feel no real balance of gain in my work on the land and yet one does it a sort of duty one feels to the land 
 but i tell you what the landowner pursued a neighbor of mine a merchant was at my place we walked about the fields and the park no said he stepan vassilyevich well looked after but your neglected but as a fact well kept up to my thinking cut down the linden trees only do it when running sap a thousand lindens and each would make two good bundles of bast and nowadays that worth something and cut down the lot of the linden shells 
 and with what he made buy up livestock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out to the peasants levin added smiling he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations and make his fortune but you and i must thank god if we keep what got and leave it to our children 
 married heard said the landowner 
 yes levin answered with proud satisfaction yes all this is rather strange he went on so we live on without any reckoning as though we were the vestals of antiquity set to guard a sacred fire or something 
 the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches 
 there are some among us too like our friend nikolai ivanovich or count vronsky settled here lately they try to set up an agronomic industry but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital 
 but why is it we do like the merchants why we cut down our parks for bast said levin returning to a thought that had struck him 
 why as you said to guard the fire besides not work for a nobleman and our work as noblemen done here at the elections but yonder each in his own nook a class instinct too of what one ought and to do there are the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can however bad the land is work it without a reckoning too at a simple loss 
 just as we do said levin very very glad to have met you he added seeing sviiazhsky approaching him 
 and here met for the first time since we met at your place said the landowner to sviiazhsky and had a good talk too 
 well have you been attacking the new order of things said sviiazhsky with a smile 
 that bound to do 
 been relieving your feelings

 sviiazhsky took arm and went with him to his own friends this time there was no avoiding vronsky he was standing with stepan arkadyevich and sergei ivanovich and looking straight at levin as he drew near 
 delighted i believe had the pleasure of meeting you at princess he said giving levin his hand 
 yes i quite remember our meeting said levin and blushing crimson he turned away immediately and began talking to his brother 
 with a slight smile vronsky went on talking to sviiazhsky obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with levin but levin as he talked to his brother was continually looking round at vronsky trying to think of something to say to him to smooth over his rudeness 
 what are we waiting for now asked levin looking at sviiazhsky and vronsky 
 for snetkov he has to refuse or accept the candidacy answered sviiazhsky 
 well and what has he done consented or not 
 the point done neither said vronsky 
 and if he refuses who will run then asked levin looking at vronsky 
 whoever chooses to said sviiazhsky 
 shall you asked levin 
 certainly not i said sviiazhsky looking confused and turning an alarmed glance at the venomous gentleman who was standing beside sergei ivanovich 
 who then neviedovsky said levin feeling he was putting his foot into it 
 but this was worse still neviedovsky and sviiazhsky were the two candidates 
 i certainly shall not under any circumstances answered the venomous gentleman 
 this was neviedovsky himself sviiazhsky introduced him to levin 
 well do you find it exciting too said stepan arkadyevich winking at vronsky something like a race one might bet on it 
 yes it is keenly exciting said vronsky and once taking the thing up eager to see it through a fight he said scowling and setting his powerful jaws 
 what a businessman sviiazhsky is sees it all so clearly 
 oh yes vronsky assented indifferently 
 a silence followed during which vronsky since he had to look at something looked at levin at his feet at his frock coat then at his face and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him he said in order to say something 
 how is it that you living constantly in the country are not a justice of the peace you are not in the uniform of one 
 because i consider the justice of the peace a silly institution morosely answered levin who had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting 
 i think so quite the contrary vronsky said with calm surprise 
 a plaything levin cut him short we want justices of the peace never had a single thing to do with them during eight years and what i have had was decided wrongly by them the justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me for a matter of two roubles or so i should have to send a lawyer who costs me fifteen 
 and he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller and when the miller told him of it had lodged a complaint for slander all this was utterly and stupid and levin felt it himself as he said it 
 oh this is such an original fellow said stepan arkadyevich with his most soothing smile but come along i think voting 
 and they separated 
 i understand said sergei ivanovich who had observed his gaucherie i understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact where we russians are so deficient the marshal of the province is our opponent and with him ami cochon and you beg him to be candidate count vronsky now not making a friend of him asked me to dinner and not going but one of our side why make an enemy of him then you ask neviedovsky if going to run not done 
 oh i understand it at all and all such nonsense levin answered somberly 
 you say all such nonsense yet as soon as you have anything to do with it you make a muddle 
 levin did not answer and they walked together into the big room 
 the marshal of the province though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him and though he had not been called upon by all to run had nevertheless made up his mind to run for office all was silence in the room the secretary announced in a loud voice that mikhail stepanovich snetkov captain of the guards would now be balloted for as marshal of the province 
 the district marshals walked carrying plates on which were balls from their tables to the province table and the election began 
 put it in the right side whispered stepan arkadyevich as levin with his brother followed the marshal of his district to the table but levin had forgotten by now the machination that had been explained to him and was afraid stepan arkadyevich might be mistaken in saying the right side surely snetkov was the enemy as he went up he held the ball in his right hand but thinking he was wrong just at the box he changed to the left hand and undoubtedly put the ball to the left an adept in the business standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball scowled with annoyance it was no good for him to use his insight 
 everything was still and the counting of the balls was heard then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against 
 the marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority all was noise and eager movement toward the doors snetkov came in and the nobles thronged round him congratulating him 
 well now is it over levin asked sergei ivanovich 
 only just beginning sviiazhsky said replying for sergei ivanovich with a smile some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal 
 levin had quite forgotten about that again now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it but he was too bored to think what it was exactly he felt depressed and longed to get out of the crowd 
 as no one was paying any attention to him and no one apparently needed him he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters the little old waiter pressed him to have something and levin agreed after eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters levin not wishing to go back to the hall where it was all so distasteful to him proceeded to walk through the galleries 
 the galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below with the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers high school teachers in spectacles and officers everywhere they were talking of the election and of how worried the marshal was and how splendid the discussions had been in one group levin heard his praises one lady was telling a lawyer 
 how glad i am i heard koznishev worth missing lunch exquisite so clear and distinct all of it not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that the only one is meidel and very far from being so eloquent 
 finding a free place levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening 
 all the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts in the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform who shouted in a loud high voice 
 as a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff captain eugenii ivanovich apukhtin a dead silence followed and then a weak old voice was heard 
 declined 
 we call upon the privy councilor piotr petrovich bol the voice began again 
 declined a high boyish voice replied 
 again it began and again came the declined and so it went on for about an hour levin with his elbows on the balustrade looked and listened at first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces he felt sad he made up his mind to go and went downstairs as he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with eyes on the stairs he met a couple a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor 
 i told you you late the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when levin moved aside to let the lady pass 
 levin was on the stairs to the way out and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for his overcoat check when the secretary overtook him this way please konstantin dmitrievich they are voting 
 the candidate who was being voted on was neviedovsky who had so stoutly denied all idea of candidacy 
 levin went up to the door of the room it was locked the secretary knocked the door opened and levin was met by two gentlemen who darted out 
 i stand any more of it said one gentleman 
 after them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out his face was from exhaustion and dismay 
 i told you not to let anyone out he cried to the doorkeeper 
 i let someone in your excellency 
 mercy on us and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room his legs wavering from fatigue 
 neviedovsky had scored a higher majority as they had planned and he was the new marshal of the province many people were amused many were pleased and happy many were in ecstasies many were disgusted and unhappy the former marshal of the province was in a state of despair which he could not conceal when neviedovsky went out of the room the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically just as they had followed the governor on the first day when he had opened the meetings and just as they had followed snetkov when he had been elected

 neviedovsky had scored a higher majority as they had planned and he was the new marshal of the province many people were amused many were pleased and happy many were in ecstasies many were disgusted and unhappy the former marshal of the province was in a state of despair which he could not conceal when neviedovsky went out of the room the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically just as they had followed the governor on the first day when he had opened the meetings and just as they had followed snetkov when he had been elected

 sviiazhsky took arm and went with him to his own friends this time there was no avoiding vronsky he was standing with stepan arkadyevich and sergei ivanovich and looking straight at levin as he drew near 
 delighted i believe had the pleasure of meeting you at princess he said giving levin his hand 
 yes i quite remember our meeting said levin and blushing crimson he turned away immediately and began talking to his brother 
 with a slight smile vronsky went on talking to sviiazhsky obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with levin but levin as he talked to his brother was continually looking round at vronsky trying to think of something to say to him to smooth over his rudeness 
 what are we waiting for now asked levin looking at sviiazhsky and vronsky 
 for snetkov he has to refuse or accept the candidacy answered sviiazhsky 
 well and what has he done consented or not 
 the point done neither said vronsky 
 and if he refuses who will run then asked levin looking at vronsky 
 whoever chooses to said sviiazhsky 
 shall you asked levin 
 certainly not i said sviiazhsky looking confused and turning an alarmed glance at the venomous gentleman who was standing beside sergei ivanovich 
 who then neviedovsky said levin feeling he was putting his foot into it 
 but this was worse still neviedovsky and sviiazhsky were the two candidates 
 i certainly shall not under any circumstances answered the venomous gentleman 
 this was neviedovsky himself sviiazhsky introduced him to levin 
 well do you find it exciting too said stepan arkadyevich winking at vronsky something like a race one might bet on it 
 yes it is keenly exciting said vronsky and once taking the thing up eager to see it through a fight he said scowling and setting his powerful jaws 
 what a businessman sviiazhsky is sees it all so clearly 
 oh yes vronsky assented indifferently 
 a silence followed during which vronsky since he had to look at something looked at levin at his feet at his frock coat then at his face and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him he said in order to say something 
 how is it that you living constantly in the country are not a justice of the peace you are not in the uniform of one 
 because i consider the justice of the peace a silly institution morosely answered levin who had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with vronsky so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting 
 i think so quite the contrary vronsky said with calm surprise 
 a plaything levin cut him short we want justices of the peace never had a single thing to do with them during eight years and what i have had was decided wrongly by them the justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me for a matter of two roubles or so i should have to send a lawyer who costs me fifteen 
 and he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller and when the miller told him of it had lodged a complaint for slander all this was utterly and stupid and levin felt it himself as he said it 
 oh this is such an original fellow said stepan arkadyevich with his most soothing smile but come along i think voting 
 and they separated 
 i understand said sergei ivanovich who had observed his gaucherie i understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact where we russians are so deficient the marshal of the province is our opponent and with him ami cochon and you beg him to be candidate count vronsky now not making a friend of him asked me to dinner and not going but one of our side why make an enemy of him then you ask neviedovsky if going to run not done 
 oh i understand it at all and all such nonsense levin answered somberly 
 you say all such nonsense yet as soon as you have anything to do with it you make a muddle 
 levin did not answer and they walked together into the big room 
 the marshal of the province though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him and though he had not been called upon by all to run had nevertheless made up his mind to run for office all was silence in the room the secretary announced in a loud voice that mikhail stepanovich snetkov captain of the guards would now be balloted for as marshal of the province 
 the district marshals walked carrying plates on which were balls from their tables to the province table and the election began 
 put it in the right side whispered stepan arkadyevich as levin with his brother followed the marshal of his district to the table but levin had forgotten by now the machination that had been explained to him and was afraid stepan arkadyevich might be mistaken in saying the right side surely snetkov was the enemy as he went up he held the ball in his right hand but thinking he was wrong just at the box he changed to the left hand and undoubtedly put the ball to the left an adept in the business standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball scowled with annoyance it was no good for him to use his insight 
 everything was still and the counting of the balls was heard then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against 
 the marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority all was noise and eager movement toward the doors snetkov came in and the nobles thronged round him congratulating him 
 well now is it over levin asked sergei ivanovich 
 only just beginning sviiazhsky said replying for sergei ivanovich with a smile some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal 
 levin had quite forgotten about that again now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it but he was too bored to think what it was exactly he felt depressed and longed to get out of the crowd 
 as no one was paying any attention to him and no one apparently needed him he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters the little old waiter pressed him to have something and levin agreed after eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters levin not wishing to go back to the hall where it was all so distasteful to him proceeded to walk through the galleries 
 the galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below with the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers high school teachers in spectacles and officers everywhere they were talking of the election and of how worried the marshal was and how splendid the discussions had been in one group levin heard his praises one lady was telling a lawyer 
 how glad i am i heard koznishev worth missing lunch exquisite so clear and distinct all of it not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that the only one is meidel and very far from being so eloquent 
 finding a free place levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening 
 all the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts in the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform who shouted in a loud high voice 
 as a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff captain eugenii ivanovich apukhtin a dead silence followed and then a weak old voice was heard 
 declined 
 we call upon the privy councilor piotr petrovich bol the voice began again 
 declined a high boyish voice replied 
 again it began and again came the declined and so it went on for about an hour levin with his elbows on the balustrade looked and listened at first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces he felt sad he made up his mind to go and went downstairs as he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with eyes on the stairs he met a couple a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor 
 i told you you late the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when levin moved aside to let the lady pass 
 levin was on the stairs to the way out and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for his overcoat check when the secretary overtook him this way please konstantin dmitrievich they are voting 
 the candidate who was being voted on was neviedovsky who had so stoutly denied all idea of candidacy 
 levin went up to the door of the room it was locked the secretary knocked the door opened and levin was met by two gentlemen who darted out 
 i stand any more of it said one gentleman 
 after them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out his face was from exhaustion and dismay 
 i told you not to let anyone out he cried to the doorkeeper 
 i let someone in your excellency 
 mercy on us and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room his legs wavering from fatigue 
 neviedovsky had scored a higher majority as they had planned and he was the new marshal of the province many people were amused many were pleased and happy many were in ecstasies many were disgusted and unhappy the former marshal of the province was in a state of despair which he could not conceal when neviedovsky went out of the room the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically just as they had followed the governor on the first day when he had opened the meetings and just as they had followed snetkov when he had been elected

 the newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with vronsky 
 vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the country and wanted to show anna his right to independence and also to repay sviiazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he had taken for vronsky at the zemstvo election but chiefly for the strict performance of all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he had taken upon himself but he had not in the least expected that the election would interest him so so keenly excite him and that he would be so good at this kind of thing he was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province but his success was unmistakable and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already obtained a certain influence this influence was due to his wealth and aristocracy the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend shirkov who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a flourishing bank in kashin the excellent cook vronsky had brought from the country and his friendship with the governor who was a schoolfellow of vronsky a schoolfellow he had patronized and protected indeed but what contributed more than all to his success was his direct equable manner with everyone which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness he was himself conscious that except for that mad gentleman married to kitty shcherbatskaia who had propos de bottes poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his adherent he saw clearly and other people recognized it too that he had done a great deal to secure the success of neviedovsky and now at his own table celebrating election he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate the election itself had so fascinated him that if he could succeed in getting married during the next three years he began to think of running for office himself much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey he had longed to ride a race himself 
 today he was celebrating the success of his jockey vronsky sat at the head of the table on his right hand sat the young governor a general of high rank to all the rest he was the master of the province who had solemnly opened the elections with his speech and aroused a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people as vronsky saw to vronsky he was katka maslov that had been his nickname in the pages corps whom he felt to be shy and tried to put at ease on the left hand sat neviedovsky with his youthful stubborn and venomous countenance with him vronsky was simple and deferential 
 sviiazhsky took his failure very lightheartedly it was indeed no failure in his eyes as he said himself turning glass in hand to neviedovsky they could not have found a better representative of the new movement which the nobility ought to follow and so every honest person as he said was on the side of success and was celebrating over it 
 stepan arkadyevich was glad too because he was having a good time and because everyone was pleased the episodes of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner sviiazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of marshal and observed addressing neviedovsky that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing accounts than tears another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been imported for the ball and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings 
 continually during dinner they said of neviedovsky our marshal and your excellency 
 this was said with the same pleasure with which a young wife is called madame and by her name neviedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation but it was obvious that he was highly delighted and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal party 
 in the course of dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the result of the election and stepan arkadyevich who was in high spirits sent darya alexandrovna a telegram neviedovsky elected by twenty votes congratulations tell people he dictated it aloud saying we must let them share our rejoicing darya alexandrovna getting the message simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it and understood that it was an afterdinner affair she knew stiva had a weakness after dining for faire jouer le tlgraphe 
 everything together with the excellent dinner and the wine not from russian merchants but imported direct from abroad was extremely dignified simple and enjoyable the party some twenty had been selected by sviiazhsky from among the more active new liberals all of the same way of thinking who were at the same time clever and they drank also half in jest to the health of the new marshal of the province of the governor of the bank director and of our amiable host 
 vronsky was satisfied he had never expected to find so pleasant a tone in the provinces 
 toward the end of dinner it was still more lively the governor asked vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the brethren which his wife who was anxious to make his acquaintance had been getting up 
 be a ball and see the belle of the province worth seeing really 
 not in my line vronsky answered he liked that english phrase but he smiled and promised to come 
 before they rose from the table when all of them were smoking valet went up to him with a letter on a tray 
 from vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger he said with a significant expression 
 astonishing how like he is to the deputy prosecutor sventitsky said one of the guests in french of the valet while vronsky frowning read the letter 
 the letter was from anna before he read the letter he knew its contents expecting the elections to be over in five days he had promised to be back on friday today was saturday and he knew that the letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed the letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her yet

 the innocent festivities over the election and this gloomy burdensome love to which he had to return struck vronsky by their contrast but he had to go and by the first train that night he set off home

 chapter 
 
 before departure for the elections anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her and resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure but the cold severe glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed 
 in solitude later thinking over that glance which had expressed his right to freedom she came as she always did to the same point the sense of her own humiliation he has the right to go away when and where he chooses not simply to go away but to leave me he has every right and i have none but knowing that he ought not to do it what has he done though he looked at me with a cold severe expression of course that is something indefinable impalpable but it has never been so before and that glance means a great deal she thought that glance shows the beginning of coolness 
 and though she felt sure that a coolness was beginning there was nothing she could do she could not in any way alter her relations to him just as before only by love and by charm could she keep him and so just as before only by occupation in the day by morphine at night could she stifle the fearful thought of what would come if he ceased to love her it is true there was still one means not to keep him for that she wanted nothing more than his love but to be nearer to him to be in such a position that he would not leave her that means was divorce and marriage and she began to long for that and made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or stiva approached her on the subject 
 absorbed in such thoughts she passed five days without him the five days that he was to be absent 
 walks conversation with princess varvara visits to the hospital and most of all reading reading of one book after another filled up her time but on the sixth day when the coachman came back without him and she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there just at that time her little girl was taken ill anna began to look after her but even that did not distract her mind especially as the illness was not serious however hard she tried she could not love this little child and to feign love was beyond her powers toward the evening of that day still alone anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the town but on second thought wrote him the contradictory letter that vronsky received and without reading it through sent it off by a special messenger the next morning she received his letter and regretted her own she dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had flung at her at parting especially when he would learn that the baby was not dangerously ill but still she was glad she had written to him by now anna was admitting to herself that she was a burden to him that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to her and in spite of that she was glad he was coming let him weary of her but he would be here with her so that she would see him would know of every action he took 
 she was sitting in the drawing room near a lamp with a new volume of taine and as she read listening to the sound of the wind outside and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive several times she had fancied she heard the sound of wheels but she had been mistaken at last she heard not the sound of wheels but the shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry even princess varvara playing solitaire confirmed this and anna flushing hotly got up but instead of going down as she had done twice before she stood still she suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity but even more she dreaded how he might meet her all feeling of wounded pride had passed now she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure she remembered that her child had been perfectly well again for the last day she felt positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her letter was sent off then she thought of him that he was here all of him with his hands his eyes she heard his voice and forgetting everything she ran joyfully to meet him 
 well how is annie he said apprehensively from below looking up to anna as she ran down to him 
 he was sitting on a chair and a footman was pulling off his warm overboots 
 oh she is better 
 and you he said shaking himself 
 she took his hand in both of hers and drew it to her waist never taking her eyes off him 
 well glad he said coldly scanning her her hair her dress which he knew she had put on for him all was charming but how many times it had charmed him and the stern stony expression that she so dreaded settled upon his face 
 well glad and are you well he said wiping his damp beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand 
 never mind she thought only let him be here and so long as here he cannot he dare not cease to love me 
 the evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of princess varvara who complained to him that anna had been taking morphine in his absence 
 what am i to do i sleep my thoughts prevented me when here i never take it hardly ever 
 he told her about the election and anna knew how by adroit questions to bring him to what gave him most pleasure his own success she told him of everything that interested him at home and all that she told him was of the most cheerful description 
 but late in the evening when they were alone anna seeing that she had regained complete possession of him wanted to erase the painful impression of the glance he had given her for her letter she said 
 tell me frankly you were vexed at getting my letter and you believe me 
 as soon as she had said it she felt that however warm his feelings were to her he had not forgiven her for that 
 yes he said the letter was so strange first annie ill and then you thought of coming yourself 
 it was all the truth 
 oh i doubt it 
 yes you do doubt it you are vexed i see 
 not for one moment only vexed true that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties 
 the duty of going to a concert 
 but we talk about it he said 
 why not talk about it she said 
 i only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up now for instance i shall have to go to moscow to arrange about the house oh anna why are you so irritable you know that i live without you 
 if so said anna her voice suddenly changing it means that you are sick of this life yes you will come for a day and go away as men do 
 anna cruel i am ready to give up my whole life 
 but she did not hear him 
 if you go to moscow i will go too i will not stay here either we must separate or else live together 
 why you know my one desire but to do that 
 we must get a divorce i will write to him i see i cannot go on like this but i will come with you to moscow 
 you talk as if you were threatening me but i desire nothing so much as never to be parted from you said vronsky smiling 
 but as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold look but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel 
 she saw the look and correctly divined its meaning 
 and if things have come to such a pass a calamity that glance told her it was a impression but she never forgot it 
 anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce and toward the end of november taking leave of princess varvara who wanted to go to peterburg she went with vronsky to moscow expecting every day an answer from alexei alexandrovich and after that the divorce they now established themselves together like married people

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter iv 
 
 forms assumed by suffering during sleep 
 three in the morning had just struck and he had been walking thus for five hours almost uninterruptedly when he at length allowed himself to drop into his chair 
 there he fell asleep and had a dream 
 this dream like the majority of dreams bore no relation to the situation except by its painful and character but it made an impression on him 
 this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on 
 it is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us 
 we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text 
 of whatever nature this dream may be the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it 
 it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul 
 here it is 
 on the envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i had that night 
 i was in a plain a vast gloomy plain where there was no grass it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night 
 i was walking with my brother the brother of my childish years the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hardly remember 
 we were conversing and we met some we were talking of a neighbor of ours in former days who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street as we talked we felt cold because of that open window 
 there were no trees in the plain 
 we saw a man passing close to us he was entirely nude of the hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was earth color 
 the man had no hair we could see his skull and the veins on it 
 in his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a and as heavy as iron 
 this horseman passed and said nothing to us 
 my brother said to me let us take to the hollow road 
 there existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor a spear of moss 
 everything was even the sky after proceeding a few paces i received no reply when i spoke i perceived that my brother was no longer with me 
 i entered a village which i espied 
 i reflected that it must be romainville 
 why romainville 
 this parenthesis is due to jean valjean 
 the first street that i entered was deserted 
 i entered a second street 
 behind the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing erect against the wall 
 i said to this man 
 what country is this 
 where am i 
 the man made no reply i saw the door of a house open and i entered 
 the first chamber was deserted 
 i entered the second 
 behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall i inquired of this man whose house is this 
 where am i the man replied not 
 the house had a garden 
 i quitted the house and entered the garden the garden was deserted 
 behind the first tree i found a man standing upright 
 i said to this man what garden is this where am i 
 the man did not answer 
 i strolled into the village and perceived that it was a town all the streets were deserted all the doors were open 
 not a single living being was passing in the streets walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens 
 but behind each angle of the walls behind each door behind each tree stood a silent man 
 only one was to be seen at a time 
 these men watched me pass 
 i left the town and began to ramble about the fields 
 after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me 
 i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town they had strange heads 
 they did not seem to be in a hurry yet they walked faster than i did 
 they made no noise as they walked in an instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me the faces of these men were earthen in hue 
 then the first one whom i had seen and questioned on entering the town said to me 
 whither are you going 
 do you not know that you have been dead this long time 
 i opened my mouth to reply and i perceived that there was no one near me 
 he woke 
 he was icy cold 
 a wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window which had been left open on their hinges 
 the fire was out 
 the candle was nearing its end 
 it was still black night 
 he rose he went to the window 
 there were no stars in the sky even yet 
 from his window the yard of the house and the street were visible a sharp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the earth 
 below him he perceived two red stars whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness 
 as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold said he there are no stars in the sky 
 they are on earth now 
 but this confusion vanished a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage 
 by the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle it was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse 
 the noise which he had heard was the trampling of the hoofs on the pavement 
 what vehicle is this he said to himself 
 who is coming here so early in the morning 
 at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber 
 he shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice 
 who is there 
 some one said 
 i monsieur le maire 
 he recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress 
 well he replied what is it 
 monsieur le maire it is just five in the morning 
 what is that to me 
 the cabriolet is here monsieur le maire 
 what cabriolet 
 the tilbury 
 what tilbury 
 did not monsieur le maire order a tilbury 
 no said he 
 the coachman says that he has come for monsieur le maire 
 what coachman 
 m coachman 
 m scaufflaire 
 that name sent a shudder over him as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face 
 ah yes he resumed m scaufflaire 
 if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been frightened 
 a tolerably long silence ensued 
 he examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax which he rolled between his fingers 
 the old woman waited for him 
 she even ventured to uplift her voice once more 
 what am i to say monsieur le maire 
 say that it is well and that i am coming down

 forms assumed by suffering during sleep 
 three in the morning had just struck and he had been walking thus for five hours almost uninterruptedly when he at length allowed himself to drop into his chair 
 there he fell asleep and had a dream 
 this dream like the majority of dreams bore no relation to the situation except by its painful and character but it made an impression on him 
 this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on 
 it is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us 
 we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text 
 of whatever nature this dream may be the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it 
 it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul 
 here it is 
 on the envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i had that night 
 i was in a plain a vast gloomy plain where there was no grass it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night 
 i was walking with my brother the brother of my childish years the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hardly remember 
 we were conversing and we met some we were talking of a neighbor of ours in former days who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street as we talked we felt cold because of that open window 
 there were no trees in the plain 
 we saw a man passing close to us he was entirely nude of the hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was earth color 
 the man had no hair we could see his skull and the veins on it 
 in his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a and as heavy as iron 
 this horseman passed and said nothing to us 
 my brother said to me let us take to the hollow road 
 there existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor a spear of moss 
 everything was even the sky after proceeding a few paces i received no reply when i spoke i perceived that my brother was no longer with me 
 i entered a village which i espied 
 i reflected that it must be romainville 
 why romainville 
 this parenthesis is due to jean valjean 
 the first street that i entered was deserted 
 i entered a second street 
 behind the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing erect against the wall 
 i said to this man 
 what country is this 
 where am i 
 the man made no reply i saw the door of a house open and i entered 
 the first chamber was deserted 
 i entered the second 
 behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall i inquired of this man whose house is this 
 where am i the man replied not 
 the house had a garden 
 i quitted the house and entered the garden the garden was deserted 
 behind the first tree i found a man standing upright 
 i said to this man what garden is this where am i 
 the man did not answer 
 i strolled into the village and perceived that it was a town all the streets were deserted all the doors were open 
 not a single living being was passing in the streets walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens 
 but behind each angle of the walls behind each door behind each tree stood a silent man 
 only one was to be seen at a time 
 these men watched me pass 
 i left the town and began to ramble about the fields 
 after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me 
 i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town they had strange heads 
 they did not seem to be in a hurry yet they walked faster than i did 
 they made no noise as they walked in an instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me the faces of these men were earthen in hue 
 then the first one whom i had seen and questioned on entering the town said to me 
 whither are you going 
 do you not know that you have been dead this long time 
 i opened my mouth to reply and i perceived that there was no one near me 
 he woke 
 he was icy cold 
 a wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window which had been left open on their hinges 
 the fire was out 
 the candle was nearing its end 
 it was still black night 
 he rose he went to the window 
 there were no stars in the sky even yet 
 from his window the yard of the house and the street were visible a sharp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the earth 
 below him he perceived two red stars whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness 
 as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold said he there are no stars in the sky 
 they are on earth now 
 but this confusion vanished a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage 
 by the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle it was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse

 chapter xi 
 
 the next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physician was repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing and had slept badly that night those around him reported the cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded 
 at daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come with a flag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor was brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary the emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at midday he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off with prince dolgorukov to the advanced post of the french army 
 it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army a personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince dolgorukov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiate with napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace 
 toward evening dolgorukov came back went straight to the tsar and remained alone with him for a long time 
 on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two days march and the outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated in the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth a great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought 
 till midday on the nineteenth the activity the eager talk running to and fro and dispatching of adjutants was confined to the headquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reached headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns by evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long 
 the concentrated activity which had begun at the headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels began to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes to play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity 
 just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the military machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken 
 just as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time so the result of all the complicated human activities of russians and french all their passions desires remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear and enthusiasm was only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the battle of the three emperors that is to say a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history 
 prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief 
 at six in the evening kutuzov went to the headquarters and after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court count tolstoy 
 bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from dolgorukov he felt that kutuzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him and also that at the headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukov 
 well how do my dear fellow said dolgorukov who was sitting at tea with bilibin the fete is for tomorrow how is your old fellow out of sorts 
 i say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to be heard 
 but they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible 
 yes you have seen him said prince andrew well what is bonaparte like how did he impress you 
 yes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement repeated dolgorukov evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon if he afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview why negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of a general battle his hour has come mark my words 
 but tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew again 
 he is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him your majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me the sort of man he is and nothing more replied dolgorukov looking round at bilibin with a smile 
 despite my great respect for old kutuzov he continued we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our hands no we forget suvorov and his rule not to put yourself in a position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old cunctators 
 but in what position are we going to attack him i have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated said prince andrew 
 he wished to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself formed 
 oh that is all the same dolgorukov said quickly and getting up he spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen if he is standing before brunn 
 and prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained plan of a flanking movement 
 prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might have been as good as but for the disadvantage that had already been approved as soon as prince andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan prince dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed not at the map but at prince face 
 there will be a council of war at tonight though you can say all this there remarked dolgorukov 
 i will do so said prince andrew moving away from the map 
 whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilibin who till then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutuzov there is not a single russian in command of a column the commanders are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince de lichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on like all those polish names 
 be quiet backbiter said dolgorukov it is not true there are now two russians miloradovich and dokhturov and there would be a third count arakcheev if his nerves were not too weak 
 however i think general kutuzov has come out said prince andrew i wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went out after shaking hands with dolgorukov and bilibin 
 on the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzov who was sitting silently beside him what he thought of battle 
 kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied i think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstoy and asked him to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but my dear general i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military matters yourself yes that was the answer i got

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the happy family 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the largest green leaf in this country is certainly the if you hold it in front of you it is large enough for an apron and if you hold it over your head it is almost as good as an umbrella it is so wonderfully large a burdock never grows alone where it grows there are many more and it is a splendid sight and all this splendor is good for snails the great white snails which grand people in olden times used to have made into fricassees and when they had eaten them they would say o what a delicious dish for these people really thought them good and these snails lived on and for them the burdock was planted 
 
 there was once an old estate where no one now lived to require 
 snails indeed the owners had all died out but the burdock still 
 flourished it grew over all the beds and walks of the garden its 
 growth had no check till it became at last quite a forest of 
 burdocks here and there stood an apple or a but for 
 this nobody would have thought the place had ever been a garden it 
 was burdock from one end to the other and here lived the last two 
 surviving snails they knew not themselves how old they were but they could remember the time when there were a great many more of them and that they were descended from a family which came from foreign lands and that the whole forest had been planted for them and theirs 
 
 they had never been away from the garden but they knew that another place once existed in the world called the palace castle in which some of their relations had been boiled till they became black and were then laid on a silver dish but what was done 
 afterwards they did not know besides they could not imagine 
 exactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver dish but no 
 doubt it was something very fine and highly genteel neither the 
 cockchafer nor the toad nor the whom they questioned 
 about it would give them the least information for none of their 
 relations had ever been cooked or served on a silver dish the old 
 white snails were the most aristocratic race in the world they 
 knew that the forest had been planted for them and the 
 castle had been built entirely that they might be cooked and laid on 
 silver dishes 
 
 they lived quite retired and very happily and as they had no 
 children of their own they had adopted a little common snail which 
 they brought up as their own child the little one would not grow for 
 he was only a common snail but the old people particularly the 
 declared that she could easily see how he grew and when the father said he could not perceive it she begged him to feel the little shell and he did so and found that the mother was 
 right 
 
 one day it rained very fast listen what a drumming there is 
 on the turn turn turn turn turn turn said the 
 
 
 there come the drops said the mother they are trickling 
 down the stalks we shall have it very wet here presently i am very 
 glad we have such good houses and that the little one has one of 
 his own there has been really more done for us than for any other 
 creature it is quite plain that we are the most noble people in the 
 world we have houses from our birth and the burdock forest has 
 been planted for us i should very much like to know how far it 
 extends and what lies beyond it 
 
 there can be nothing better than we have here said the 
 i wish for nothing more 
 
 yes but i do said the mother i should like to be taken to 
 the palace and boiled and laid upon a silver dish as was done to 
 all our ancestors and you may be sure it must be something very 
 uncommon 
 
 the castle perhaps has fallen to decay said the 
 or the burdock wood may have grown out you need not 
 be in a hurry you are always so impatient and the youngster is 
 getting just the same he has been three days creeping to the top of 
 that stalk i feel quite giddy when i look at him 
 
 you must not scold him said the he creeps so 
 very carefully he will be the joy of our home and we old folks 
 have nothing else to live for but have you ever thought where we 
 are to get a wife for him do you think that farther out in the wood 
 there may be others of our race 
 
 there may be black snails no doubt said the old snail 
 
 black snails without houses but they are so vulgar and conceited 
 too but we can give the ants a commission they run here and there 
 as if they all had so much business to get through they most likely 
 will know of a wife for our youngster 
 
 i certainly know a most beautiful bride said one of the ants 
 
 but i fear it would not do for she is a queen 
 
 that does not matter said the old snail has she a house 
 
 she has a palace replied the ant a most beautiful 
 with seven hundred passages 
 
 said the but our boy shall not go to 
 live in an if you know of nothing better we will give the 
 commission to the white gnats they fly about in rain and sunshine 
 they know the burdock wood from one end to the other 
 
 we have a wife for him said the gnats a hundred 
 from here there is a little snail with a house sitting on a 
 she is quite alone and old enough to be married 
 it is only a hundred from here 
 
 then let her come to him said the old people he has the whole 
 burdock forest she has only a bush 
 
 so they brought the little she took eight days to 
 perform the journey but that was just as it ought to be for it 
 showed her to be one of the right breeding and then they had a 
 wedding six gave as much light as they could but in other respects it was all very quiet for the old snails could not bear 
 festivities or a crowd but a beautiful speech was made by the 
 the father could not speak he was too much overcome 
 
 then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an 
 inheritance and repeated what they had so often said that it was the 
 finest place in the world and that if they led upright and 
 honorable lives and their family increased they and their children 
 might some day be taken to the palace to be boiled 
 black and laid on a silver dish and when they had finished speaking 
 the old couple crept into their houses and came out no more for they slept 
 
 the young snail pair now ruled in the forest and had a numerous 
 progeny but as the young ones were never boiled or laid in silver 
 dishes they concluded that the castle had fallen into decay and that 
 all the people in the world were dead and as nobody contradicted 
 them they thought they must be right and the rain fell upon the 
 to play the drum for them and the sun shone to 
 paint colors on the burdock forest for them and they were very happy the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy 
 
 the end

 getting just the same he has been three days creeping to the top of 
 that stalk i feel quite giddy when i look at him 
 
 you must not scold him said the he creeps so 
 very carefully he will be the joy of our home and we old folks 
 have nothing else to live for but have you ever thought where we 
 are to get a wife for him do you think that farther out in the wood 
 there may be others of our race 
 
 there may be black snails no doubt said the old snail 
 
 black snails without houses but they are so vulgar and conceited 
 too but we can give the ants a commission they run here and there 
 as if they all had so much business to get through they most likely 
 will know of a wife for our youngster 
 
 i certainly know a most beautiful bride said one of the ants 
 
 but i fear it would not do for she is a queen 
 
 that does not matter said the old snail has she a house 
 
 she has a palace replied the ant a most beautiful 
 with seven hundred passages 
 
 said the but our boy shall not go to 
 live in an if you know of nothing better we will give the 
 commission to the white gnats they fly about in rain and sunshine 
 they know the burdock wood from one end to the other 
 
 we have a wife for him said the gnats a hundred 
 from here there is a little snail with a house sitting on a 
 she is quite alone and old enough to be married 
 it is only a hundred from here 
 
 then let her come to him said the old people he has the whole 
 burdock forest she has only a bush 
 
 so they brought the little she took eight days to 
 perform the journey but that was just as it ought to be for it 
 showed her to be one of the right breeding and then they had a 
 wedding six gave as much light as they could but in other respects it was all very quiet for the old snails could not bear 
 festivities or a crowd but a beautiful speech was made by the 
 the father could not speak he was too much overcome 
 
 then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an 
 inheritance and repeated what they had so often said that it was the 
 finest place in the world and that if they led upright and 
 honorable lives and their family increased they and their children 
 might some day be taken to the palace to be boiled 
 black and laid on a silver dish and when they had finished speaking 
 the old couple crept into their houses and came out no more for they slept 
 
 the young snail pair now ruled in the forest and had a numerous 
 progeny but as the young ones were never boiled or laid in silver 
 dishes they concluded that the castle had fallen into decay and that 
 all the people in the world were dead and as nobody contradicted 
 them they thought they must be right and the rain fell upon the 
 to play the drum for them and the sun shone to 
 paint colors on the burdock forest for them and they were very happy the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the jewish maiden 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in a charity school among the children sat a little jewish girl 
 she was a good intelligent child and very quick at her lessons 
 but the class she was not allowed to join for this 
 was a christian school during the hour of this lesson the jewish 
 girl was allowed to learn her geography or to work her sum for the 
 next day and when her geography lesson was perfect the book remained 
 open before her but she read not another word for she sat silently 
 listening to the words of the christian teacher he soon became 
 aware that the little one was paying more attention to what he said 
 than most of the other children read your book sarah he said to 
 her gently 
 but again and again he saw her dark beaming eyes fixed upon 
 him and once when he asked her a question she could answer him even 
 better than the other children she had not only heard but understood 
 his words and pondered them in her heart her father a poor but 
 honest man had placed his daughter at the school on the conditions 
 that she should not be instructed in the christian faith but it might 
 have caused confusion or raised discontent in the minds of the 
 other children if she had been sent out of the room so she 
 remained and now it was evident this could not go on the teacher 
 went to her father and advised him to remove his daughter from the 
 school or to allow her to become a christian i cannot any longer be 
 an idle spectator of those beaming eyes which express such a deep and 
 earnest longing for the words of the gospel said he 
 then the father burst into tears i know very little of the law 
 of my fathers said he but mother was firm in her belief as 
 a daughter of israel and i vowed to her on her deathbed that our 
 child should never be baptized i must keep my vow it is to me even 
 as a covenant with god himself and so the little jewish girl left 
 the christian school 
 years rolled by in one of the smallest provincial towns in a 
 humble household lived a poor maiden of the jewish faith as a 
 servant her hair was black as ebony her eye dark as night yet 
 full of light and brilliancy so peculiar to the daughters of the east 
 it was sarah the expression in the face of the maiden was 
 still the same as when a child she sat on the schoolroom form 
 listening with thoughtful eyes to the words of the christian 
 teacher every sunday there sounded forth from a church close by the 
 tones of an organ and the singing of the congregation the jewish girl 
 heard them in the house where industrious and faithful in all things 
 she performed her household duties thou shalt keep the sabbath 
 holy said the voice of the law in her heart but her sabbath was a 
 working day among the christians which was a great trouble to her 
 and then as the thought arose in her mind does god reckon by days 
 and hours her conscience felt satisfied on this question and she 
 found it a comfort to her that on the christian sabbath she could 
 have an hour for her own prayers undisturbed the music and singing of 
 the congregation sounded in her ears while at work in her kitchen 
 till the place itself became sacred to her then she would read in the 
 old testament that treasure and comfort to her people and it was 
 indeed the only scriptures she could read faithfully in her inmost 
 thoughts had she kept the words of her father to her teacher when 
 she left the school and the vow he had made to her dying mother 
 that she should never receive christian baptism the new testament 
 must remain to her a sealed book and yet she knew a great deal of its 
 teaching and the sound of the gospel truths still lingered among 
 the recollections of her childhood 
 one evening she was sitting in a corner of the 
 while her master read aloud it was not the gospel he read but an old 
 therefore she might stay and listen to him the story 
 related that a hungarian knight who had been taken prisoner by a 
 turkish pasha was most cruelly treated by him he caused him to be 
 yoked with his oxen to the plough and driven with blows from the whip 
 till the blood flowed and he almost sunk with exhaustion and pain 
 the faithful wife of the knight at home gave up all her jewels 
 mortgaged her castle and land and his friends raised large sums to 
 make up the ransom demanded for his release which was most enormously 
 high it was collected at last and the knight released from slavery 
 and misery sick and exhausted he reached home 
 ere long came another summons to a struggle with the foes of 
 christianity the still living knight heard the sound he could endure 
 no more he had neither peace nor rest he caused himself to be lifted 
 on his the color came into his cheeks and his strength 
 returned to him again as he went forth to battle and to victory the 
 very same pasha who had yoked him to the plough became his 
 prisoner and was dragged to a dungeon in the castle but an hour 
 had scarcely passed when the knight stood before the captive pasha 
 and inquired what do you suppose awaiteth thee 
 i know replied the pasha retribution 
 yes the retribution of a christian replied the knight the 
 teaching of christ the teacher commands us to forgive our enemies 
 to love our neighbors for god is love depart in peace return to thy 
 home i give thee back to thy loved ones but in future be mild and 
 humane to all who are in trouble 
 then the prisoner burst into tears and exclaimed oh how could i 
 imagine such mercy and forgiveness i expected pain and torment it 
 seemed to me so sure that i took poison which i secretly carried 
 about me and in a few hours its effects will destroy me i must 
 die nothing can save me but before i die explain to me the teaching 
 which is so full of love and mercy so great and oh that 
 i may hear his teaching and die a christian and his prayer was 
 granted 
 this was the legend which the master read out of the old 
 every one in the house who was present listened and 
 shared the pleasure but sarah the jewish girl sitting so still in a 
 corner felt her heart burn with excitement great tears came into her 
 shining dark eyes and with the same gentle piety with which she had 
 once listened to the gospel while sitting on the form at school she 
 felt its grandeur now and the tears rolled down her cheeks then 
 the last words of her dying mother rose before her let not my 
 child become a christian and with them sounded in her heart the 
 words of the law honor thy father and thy mother 
 i am not admitted among the christians she said they mock 
 me as a jewish girl the neighbors boys did so last sunday when i 
 stood looking in through the open church door at the candles burning 
 on the altar and listening to the singing ever since i sat on the 
 i have felt the power of christianity a power which 
 like a sunbeam streams into my heart however closely i may close 
 my eyes against it but i will not grieve thee my mother in thy 
 grave i will not be unfaithful to my vow i will not read 
 the bible of the christian i have the god of my fathers and in him i 
 will trust 
 and again years passed by master died and his widow 
 found herself in such reduced circumstances that she wished to dismiss 
 her servant maid but sarah refused to leave the house and she became 
 a true support in time of trouble and kept the household together 
 by working till late at night with her busy hands to earn their 
 daily bread not a relative came forward to assist them and the widow 
 was confined to a sick bed for months and grew weaker from day to day 
 sarah worked hard but contrived to spare time to amuse her and 
 watch by the sick bed she was gentle and pious an angel of 
 blessing in that house of poverty 
 my bible lies on the table yonder said the sick woman one day 
 to sarah read me something from it the night appears so long and 
 my spirit thirsts to hear the word of god 
 and sarah bowed her head she took the book and folded her hand 
 over the bible of the christians and at last opened it and read to 
 the sick woman tears stood in her eyes as she read and they shone 
 with brightness for in her heart it was light 
 mother she murmured thy child may not receive christian 
 baptism nor be admitted into the congregation of christian people 
 thou hast so willed it and i will respect thy command we are 
 therefore still united here on earth but in the next world there will 
 be a higher union even with god himself who leads and guides his 
 people till death he came down from heaven to earth to suffer for us 
 that we should bring forth the fruits of repentance i understand it 
 now i know not how i learnt this truth unless it is through the name 
 of christ yet she trembled as she pronounced the holy name she 
 struggled against these convictions of the truth of christianity for 
 some days till one evening while watching her mistress she was 
 suddenly taken very ill her limbs tottered under her and she sank 
 fainting by the bedside of the sick woman 
 poor sarah said the neighbors she is overcome with hard 
 work and night watching and then they carried her to the hospital 
 for the sick poor there she died and they bore her to her 
 in the earth but not to the churchyard of the 
 christians there was no place for the jewish girl but they dug a 
 grave for her outside the wall and sun which shines upon the 
 graves of the churchyard of the christians also throws its beams on 
 the grave of the jewish maiden beyond the wall and when the psalms of 
 the christians sound across the churchyard their echo reaches her 
 lonely and she who sleeps there will be counted 
 worthy at the resurrection through the name of christ the lord who 
 said to his disciples john baptized you with water but i will 
 baptize you with the holy ghost

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter v 
 
 hindrances 
 the posting service from arras to m sur m was still operated at this period by small of the time of the empire these were cabriolets upholstered inside with leather hung on springs and having but two seats one for the postboy the other for the traveller 
 the wheels were armed with those long offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance and which may still be seen on the road in germany the despatch box an immense oblong coffer was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it 
 this coffer was painted black and the cabriolet yellow 
 these vehicles which have no counterparts nowadays had something distorted and hunchbacked about them and when one saw them passing in the distance and climbing up some road to the horizon they resembled the insects which are called i think termites and which though with but little corselet drag a great train behind them but they travelled at a very rapid rate 
 the which set out from arras at one every night after the mail from paris had passed arrived at m sur m a little before five in the morning 
 that night the wagon which was descending to m sur m by the hesdin road collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the town with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse which was going in the opposite direction and in which there was but one person a man enveloped in a mantle 
 the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock 
 the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop 
 that man is in a devilish hurry said the postman 
 the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity 
 whither was he going 
 he could not have told 
 why was he hastening he did not know 
 he was driving at random straight ahead 
 whither to arras no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere as well at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered 
 he plunged into the night as into a gulf 
 something urged him forward something drew him on 
 no one could have told what was taking place within him every one will understand it 
 what man is there who has not entered at least once in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown 
 however he had resolved on nothing decided nothing formed no plan done nothing 
 none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment 
 why was he going to arras 
 he repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired cabriolet 
 that whatever the result was to be there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes and judge of matters for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what took place that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized that one made mountains out of everything from a distance that at any rate when he should have seen that champmathieu some wretch his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead that javert would indeed be there and that brevet that chenildieu that cochepaille old convicts who had known him but they certainly would not recognize what an idea that javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champmathieu and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures that accordingly there was no danger 
 that it was no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerge from it that after all he held his destiny however bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it 
 he clung to this thought 
 at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to arras 
 nevertheless he was going thither 
 as he meditated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that fine regular and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour 
 in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something within him draw back 
 at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m sur m lay far behind him 
 he watched the horizon grow white he stared at all the chilly figures of a dawn as they passed before his eyes but without seeing them 
 the morning has its spectres as well as the evening 
 he did not see them but without his being aware of it and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul 
 each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people there within who are sleeping 
 the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road produced a gentle monotonous noise 
 these things are charming when one is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad 
 it was broad daylight when he arrived at hesdin 
 he halted in front of the inn to allow the horse a breathing spell and to have him given some oats 
 the horse belonged as scaufflaire had said to that small race of the boulonnais which has too much head too much belly and not enough neck and shoulders but which has a broad chest a large crupper thin fine legs and solid homely but a robust and healthy race 
 the excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours and had not a drop of sweat on his loins 
 he did not get out of the tilbury 
 the stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel 
 are you going far in this condition said the man 
 he replied with an air of not having roused himself from his revery 
 why 
 have you come from a great distance went on the man 
 five leagues 
 ah 
 why do you say ah 
 the man bent down once more was silent for a moment with his eyes fixed on the wheel then he rose erect and said 
 because though this wheel has travelled five leagues it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league 
 he sprang out of the tilbury 
 what is that you say my friend 
 i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway just see here 
 the wheel really had suffered serious damage 
 the shock administered by the had split two spokes and strained the hub so that the nut no longer held firm 
 my friend he said to the stableman is there a wheelwright here 
 certainly sir 
 do me the service to go and fetch him 
 he is only a step from here 
 hey 
 master bourgaillard 
 master bourgaillard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold he came examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken 
 can you repair this wheel immediately 
 yes sir 
 when can i set out again 
 
 
 there is a long work on it 
 are you in a hurry sir 
 in a very great hurry 
 i must set out again in an hour at the latest 
 impossible sir 
 i will pay whatever you ask 
 impossible 
 well in two hours then 
 impossible two new spokes and a hub must be made monsieur will not be able to start before morning 
 the matter cannot wait until what if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it 
 how so 
 you are a wheelwright 
 certainly sir 
 have you not a wheel that you can sell me 
 then i could start again at once 
 a spare wheel 
 yes 
 i have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet 
 two wheels make a pair 
 two wheels cannot be put together 
 in that case sell me a pair of wheels 
 not all wheels fit all axles sir 
 try nevertheless 
 it is useless sir 
 i have nothing to sell but we are but a poor country here 
 have you a cabriolet that you can let me have 
 the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle 
 he shrugged his shoulders 
 you treat the cabriolets that people let you so well 
 if i had one i would not let it to you 
 well sell it to me then 
 i have none 
 what not even a i am not hard to please as you see 
 we live in a poor country 
 there is in truth added the wheelwright an old calash under the shed yonder which belongs to a bourgeois of the town who gave it to me to take care of and who only uses it on the of the that is to say 
 i might let that to you for what matters it to me 
 but the bourgeois must not see it then it is a calash it would require two horses 
 i will take two 
 where is monsieur going 
 to arras 
 and monsieur wishes to reach there 
 yes of course 
 by taking two 
 why not 
 does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at four morning 
 certainly not 
 there is one thing to be said about that you see by taking monsieur has his passport 
 yes 
 well by taking monsieur cannot reach arras before we are on a the relays are badly served the horses are in the fields 
 the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from the post as well as elsewhere 
 monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay and then they drive at a walk 
 there are many hills to ascend 
 come then i will go on horseback 
 unharness the cabriolet some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood 
 without doubt 
 but will this horse bear the saddle 
 that is true you remind me of that he will not bear it 
 then 
 but i can surely hire a horse in the village 
 a horse to travel to arras at one stretch 
 yes 
 that would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts you would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you but you will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a thousand 
 what am i to do 
 the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and set out on your journey 
 will be too late 
 the deuce 
 is there not a which runs to arras 
 when will it pass 
 both the posts pass at night the one going as well as the one coming 
 what 
 it will take you a day to mend this wheel 
 a day and a good long one 
 if you set two men to work 
 if i set ten men to work 
 what if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes 
 that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the felly is in a bad state too 
 is there any one in this village who lets out teams 
 no 
 is there another wheelwright 
 the stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the head 
 no 
 he felt an immense joy 
 it was evident that providence was intervening 
 that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road 
 he had not yielded to this sort of first summons he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season nor fatigue nor by the expense he had nothing with which to reproach himself 
 if he went no further that was no fault of his 
 it did not concern him further it was no longer his fault 
 it was not the act of his own conscience but the act of providence 
 he breathed again 
 he breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since visit 
 it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him 
 it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifesting himself 
 he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly 
 if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn it would have had no witnesses no one would have heard him things would have rested there and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse but this conversation had taken place in the street any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd 
 there are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators while he was questioning the wheelwright some people who were passing back and forth halted around them 
 after listening for a few minutes a young lad to whom no one had paid any heed detached himself from the group and ran off 
 at the moment when the traveller after the inward deliberation which we have just described resolved to retrace his steps this child returned 
 he was accompanied by an old woman 
 monsieur said the woman my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet 
 these simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs 
 he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him ready to seize him once more 
 he answered 
 yes my good woman i am in search of a cabriolet which i can hire 
 and he hastened to add 
 but there is none in the place 
 certainly there is said the old woman 
 where interpolated the wheelwright 
 at my house replied the old woman 
 he shuddered 
 the fatal hand had grasped him again 
 the old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket the wheelwright and the in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches interfered 
 it was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs the rain came into it the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury a regular ramshackle old the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc etc 
 all this was true but this trap this ramshackle old vehicle this thing whatever it was ran on its two wheels and could go to arras 
 he paid what was asked left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired intending to reclaim it on his return had the white horse put to the cart climbed into it and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning 
 at the moment when the cart moved off he admitted that he had felt a moment previously a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding 
 he examined this joy with a sort of wrath and found it absurd 
 why should he feel joy at turning back after all he was taking this trip of his own free will no one was forcing him to it 
 and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose 
 as he left hesdin he heard a voice shouting to him 
 stop 
 stop he halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope 
 it was the old little boy 
 monsieur said the latter it was i who got the cart for you 
 well 
 you have not given me anything 
 he who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious 
 ah you you scamp said he you shall have nothing 
 he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed 
 he had lost a great deal of time at hesdin 
 he wanted to make it good the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the month of february there had been rain the roads were bad and then it was no longer the tilbury 
 the cart was very heavy and in addition there were many ascents 
 he took nearly four hours to go from hesdin to four hours for five leagues 
 at he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable as he had promised scaufflaire he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating he thought of sad and confusing things 
 the wife came to the stable 
 does not monsieur wish to breakfast 
 come that is true i even have a good appetite 
 he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful face she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth 
 make haste said he i must start again i am in a hurry 
 a big flemish placed his knife and fork in all haste he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort 
 that is what ailed me he thought i had not breakfasted 
 his breakfast was served he seized the bread took a mouthful and then slowly replaced it on the table and did not touch it again 
 a carter was eating at another table he said to this man 
 why is their bread so bitter here 
 the carter was a german and did not understand him 
 he returned to the stable and remained near the horse 
 an hour later he had quitted and was directing his course towards tinques which is only five leagues from arras 
 what did he do during this journey 
 of what was he thinking as in the morning he watched the trees the thatched roofs the tilled fields pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from thought 
 what is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time to travel is to be born and to die at every instant perhaps in the vaguest region of his mind be did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence 
 all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us the dark and bright intervals are intermingled after a dazzling moment an eclipse we look we hasten we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing each event is a turn in the road and all at once we are old we feel a shock all is black we distinguish an obscure door the gloomy horse of life which has been drawing us halts and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows 
 twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter tinques it is true that the days were still short he did not halt at tinques as he emerged from the village a laborer who was mending the road with stones raised his head and said to him 
 that horse is very much fatigued 
 the poor beast was in fact going at a walk 
 are you going to arras added the 
 yes 
 if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early 
 he stopped his horse and asked the laborer 
 how far is it from here to arras 
 nearly seven good leagues 
 how is that the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter 
 ah returned the so you know that the road is under repair 
 you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further 
 really 
 you will take the road on the left leading to carency you will cross the river when you reach camblin you will turn to the right that is the road to which leads to arras 
 but it is night and i shall lose my way 
 you do not belong in these parts 
 no 
 and besides it is all stop sir resumed the shall i give you a piece of advice your horse is tired return to tinques there is a good inn there sleep there you can reach arras 
 i must be there this evening 
 that is different but go to the inn all the same and get an extra horse the will guide you through the 
 he followed the advice retraced his steps and half an hour later he passed the same spot again but this time at full speed with a good horse to aid a who called himself a postilion was seated on the shaft of the cariole 
 still he felt that he had lost time 
 night had fully come 
 they turned into the the way became frightfully bad the cart lurched from one rut to the other he said to the postilion 
 keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee 
 in one of the jolts the broke 
 the broken sir said the postilion i know how to harness my horse now this road is very bad at night if you wish to return and sleep at tinques we could be in arras early morning 
 he replied have you a bit of rope and a knife 
 yes sir 
 he cut a branch from a tree and made a of it 
 this caused another loss of twenty minutes but they set out again at a gallop 
 the plain was gloomy black crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke 
 there were whitish gleams in the clouds a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon as of some one moving furniture everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror how many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night 
 he was stiff with cold he had eaten nothing since the night before he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of d eight years previously and it seemed but yesterday 
 the hour struck from a distant tower he asked the boy 
 what time is it 
 seven sir we shall reach arras at eight we have but three leagues still to go 
 at that moment he for the first time indulged in this reflection thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner that all this trouble which he was taking was perhaps useless that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should at least have informed himself of that that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not then he sketched out some calculations in his mind that ordinarily the sittings of the court of assizes began at nine in the morning that it could not be a long affair that the theft of the apples would be very brief that there would then remain only a question of identity four or five depositions and very little for the lawyers to say that he should arrive after all was over 
 the postilion whipped up the horses they had crossed the river and left behind them 
 the night grew more profound

 hindrances 
 the posting service from arras to m sur m was still operated at this period by small of the time of the empire these were cabriolets upholstered inside with leather hung on springs and having but two seats one for the postboy the other for the traveller 
 the wheels were armed with those long offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance and which may still be seen on the road in germany the despatch box an immense oblong coffer was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it 
 this coffer was painted black and the cabriolet yellow 
 these vehicles which have no counterparts nowadays had something distorted and hunchbacked about them and when one saw them passing in the distance and climbing up some road to the horizon they resembled the insects which are called i think termites and which though with but little corselet drag a great train behind them but they travelled at a very rapid rate 
 the which set out from arras at one every night after the mail from paris had passed arrived at m sur m a little before five in the morning 
 that night the wagon which was descending to m sur m by the hesdin road collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the town with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse which was going in the opposite direction and in which there was but one person a man enveloped in a mantle 
 the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock 
 the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop 
 that man is in a devilish hurry said the postman 
 the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity 
 whither was he going 
 he could not have told 
 why was he hastening he did not know 
 he was driving at random straight ahead 
 whither to arras no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere as well at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered 
 he plunged into the night as into a gulf 
 something urged him forward something drew him on 
 no one could have told what was taking place within him every one will understand it 
 what man is there who has not entered at least once in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown 
 however he had resolved on nothing decided nothing formed no plan done nothing 
 none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment 
 why was he going to arras 
 he repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired cabriolet 
 that whatever the result was to be there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes and judge of matters for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what took place that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized that one made mountains out of everything from a distance that at any rate when he should have seen that champmathieu some wretch his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead that javert would indeed be there and that brevet that chenildieu that cochepaille old convicts who had known him but they certainly would not recognize what an idea that javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champmathieu and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures that accordingly there was no danger 
 that it was no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerge from it that after all he held his destiny however bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it 
 he clung to this thought 
 at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to arras 
 nevertheless he was going thither 
 as he meditated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that fine regular and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour 
 in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something within him draw back 
 at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m sur m lay far behind him 
 he watched the horizon grow white he stared at all the chilly figures of a dawn as they passed before his eyes but without seeing them 
 the morning has its spectres as well as the evening 
 he did not see them but without his being aware of it and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul 
 each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people there within who are sleeping 
 the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road produced a gentle monotonous noise 
 these things are charming when one is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad 
 it was broad daylight when he arrived at hesdin 
 he halted in front of the inn to allow the horse a breathing spell and to have him given some oats 
 the horse belonged as scaufflaire had said to that small race of the boulonnais which has too much head too much belly and not enough neck and shoulders but which has a broad chest a large crupper thin fine legs and solid homely but a robust and healthy race 
 the excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours and had not a drop of sweat on his loins 
 he did not get out of the tilbury 
 the stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel 
 are you going far in this condition said the man 
 he replied with an air of not having roused himself from his revery 
 why 
 have you come from a great distance went on the man 
 five leagues 
 ah 
 why do you say ah 
 the man bent down once more was silent for a moment with his eyes fixed on the wheel then he rose erect and said 
 because though this wheel has travelled five leagues it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league 
 he sprang out of the tilbury 
 what is that you say my friend 
 i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway just see here 
 the wheel really had suffered serious damage 
 the shock administered by the had split two spokes and strained the hub so that the nut no longer held firm 
 my friend he said to the stableman is there a wheelwright here 
 certainly sir 
 do me the service to go and fetch him 
 he is only a step from here 
 hey 
 master bourgaillard 
 master bourgaillard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold he came examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken 
 can you repair this wheel immediately 
 yes sir 
 when can i set out again 
 
 
 there is a long work on it 
 are you in a hurry sir 
 in a very great hurry 
 i must set out again in an hour at the latest 
 impossible sir 
 i will pay whatever you ask 
 impossible 
 well in two hours then 
 impossible two new spokes and a hub must be made monsieur will not be able to start before morning 
 the matter cannot wait until what if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it 
 how so 
 you are a wheelwright 
 certainly sir 
 have you not a wheel that you can sell me 
 then i could start again at once 
 a spare wheel 
 yes 
 i have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet 
 two wheels make a pair 
 two wheels cannot be put together 
 in that case sell me a pair of wheels 
 not all wheels fit all axles sir 
 try nevertheless 
 it is useless sir 
 i have nothing to sell but we are but a poor country here 
 have you a cabriolet that you can let me have 
 the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle 
 he shrugged his shoulders 
 you treat the cabriolets that people let you so well 
 if i had one i would not let it to you 
 well sell it to me then 
 i have none 
 what not even a i am not hard to please as you see 
 we live in a poor country 
 there is in truth added the wheelwright an old calash under the shed yonder which belongs to a bourgeois of the town who gave it to me to take care of and who only uses it on the of the that is to say 
 i might let that to you for what matters it to me 
 but the bourgeois must not see it then it is a calash it would require two horses 
 i will take two 
 where is monsieur going 
 to arras 
 and monsieur wishes to reach there 
 yes of course 
 by taking two 
 why not 
 does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at four morning 
 certainly not 
 there is one thing to be said about that you see by taking monsieur has his passport 
 yes 
 well by taking monsieur cannot reach arras before we are on a the relays are badly served the horses are in the fields 
 the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from the post as well as elsewhere 
 monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay and then they drive at a walk 
 there are many hills to ascend 
 come then i will go on horseback 
 unharness the cabriolet some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood 
 without doubt 
 but will this horse bear the saddle 
 that is true you remind me of that he will not bear it 
 then 
 but i can surely hire a horse in the village 
 a horse to travel to arras at one stretch 
 yes 
 that would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts you would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you but you will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a thousand 
 what am i to do 
 the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and set out on your journey 
 will be too late 
 the deuce 
 is there not a which runs to arras 
 when will it pass 
 both the posts pass at night the one going as well as the one coming 
 what 
 it will take you a day to mend this wheel 
 a day and a good long one 
 if you set two men to work 
 if i set ten men to work 
 what if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes 
 that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the felly is in a bad state too 
 is there any one in this village who lets out teams 
 no 
 is there another wheelwright 
 the stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the head 
 no 
 he felt an immense joy 
 it was evident that providence was intervening 
 that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road 
 he had not yielded to this sort of first summons he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season nor fatigue nor by the expense he had nothing with which to reproach himself 
 if he went no further that was no fault of his 
 it did not concern him further it was no longer his fault 
 it was not the act of his own conscience but the act of providence 
 he breathed again 
 he breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since visit 
 it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him 
 it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifesting himself 
 he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly 
 if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn it would have had no witnesses no one would have heard him things would have rested there and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse but this conversation had taken place in the street any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd 
 there are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators while he was questioning the wheelwright some people who were passing back and forth halted around them 
 after listening for a few minutes a young lad to whom no one had paid any heed detached himself from the group and ran off 
 at the moment when the traveller after the inward deliberation which we have just described resolved to retrace his steps this child returned 
 he was accompanied by an old woman 
 monsieur said the woman my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet 
 these simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs 
 he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him ready to seize him once more 
 he answered 
 yes my good woman i am in search of a cabriolet which i can hire 
 and he hastened to add 
 but there is none in the place 
 certainly there is said the old woman 
 where interpolated the wheelwright 
 at my house replied the old woman 
 he shuddered 
 the fatal hand had grasped him again 
 the old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket the wheelwright and the in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches interfered 
 it was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs the rain came into it the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury a regular ramshackle old the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc etc 
 all this was true but this trap this ramshackle old vehicle this thing whatever it was ran on its two wheels and could go to arras 
 he paid what was asked left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired intending to reclaim it on his return had the white horse put to the cart climbed into it and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning 
 at the moment when the cart moved off he admitted that he had felt a moment previously a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding 
 he examined this joy with a sort of wrath and found it absurd 
 why should he feel joy at turning back after all he was taking this trip of his own free will no one was forcing him to it 
 and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose 
 as he left hesdin he heard a voice shouting to him 
 stop 
 stop he halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope 
 it was the old little boy 
 monsieur said the latter it was i who got the cart for you 
 well 
 you have not given me anything 
 he who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious 
 ah you you scamp said he you shall have nothing 
 he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed 
 he had lost a great deal of time at hesdin 
 he wanted to make it good the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the month of february there had been rain the roads were bad and then it was no longer the tilbury 
 the cart was very heavy and in addition there were many ascents

 at he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable as he had promised scaufflaire he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating he thought of sad and confusing things 
 the wife came to the stable 
 does not monsieur wish to breakfast 
 come that is true i even have a good appetite 
 he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful face she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth 
 make haste said he i must start again i am in a hurry 
 a big flemish placed his knife and fork in all haste he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort 
 that is what ailed me he thought i had not breakfasted 
 his breakfast was served he seized the bread took a mouthful and then slowly replaced it on the table and did not touch it again 
 a carter was eating at another table he said to this man 
 why is their bread so bitter here 
 the carter was a german and did not understand him 
 he returned to the stable and remained near the horse 
 an hour later he had quitted and was directing his course towards tinques which is only five leagues from arras 
 what did he do during this journey 
 of what was he thinking as in the morning he watched the trees the thatched roofs the tilled fields pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from thought

 that horse is very much fatigued 
 the poor beast was in fact going at a walk 
 are you going to arras added the 
 yes 
 if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early 
 he stopped his horse and asked the laborer 
 how far is it from here to arras 
 nearly seven good leagues 
 how is that the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter 
 ah returned the so you know that the road is under repair 
 you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further 
 really 
 you will take the road on the left leading to carency you will cross the river when you reach camblin you will turn to the right that is the road to which leads to arras 
 but it is night and i shall lose my way 
 you do not belong in these parts 
 no 
 and besides it is all stop sir resumed the shall i give you a piece of advice your horse is tired return to tinques there is a good inn there sleep there you can reach arras 
 i must be there this evening 
 that is different but go to the inn all the same and get an extra horse the will guide you through the 
 he followed the advice retraced his steps and half an hour later he passed the same spot again but this time at full speed with a good horse to aid a who called himself a postilion was seated on the shaft of the cariole 
 still he felt that he had lost time 
 night had fully come 
 they turned into the the way became frightfully bad the cart lurched from one rut to the other he said to the postilion 
 keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee 
 in one of the jolts the broke 
 the broken sir said the postilion i know how to harness my horse now this road is very bad at night if you wish to return and sleep at tinques we could be in arras early morning 
 he replied have you a bit of rope and a knife 
 yes sir 
 he cut a branch from a tree and made a of it 
 this caused another loss of twenty minutes but they set out again at a gallop 
 the plain was gloomy black crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke

 the hour struck from a distant tower he asked the boy 
 what time is it 
 seven sir we shall reach arras at eight we have but three leagues still to go 
 at that moment he for the first time indulged in this reflection thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner that all this trouble which he was taking was perhaps useless that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should at least have informed himself of that that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not then he sketched out some calculations in his mind that ordinarily the sittings of the court of assizes began at nine in the morning that it could not be a long affair that the theft of the apples would be very brief that there would then remain only a question of identity four or five depositions and very little for the lawyers to say that he should arrive after all was over

 book three 
 chapter xii 
 
 shortly after nine that evening weyrother drove with his plans to quarters where the council of war was to be held all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in and with the exception of prince bagration who declined to come were all there at the appointed time 
 weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to weyrother had been twice that evening to the picket line to reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and austrian to report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrived at 
 he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly without looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply to questions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful weary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty and 
 kutuzov was occupying a castle of modest dimensions near ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander in office were gathered kutuzov himself weyrother and the members of the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaited prince bagration to begin the council at last orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and availing himself of permission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at the council he remained in the room 
 since prince bagration is not coming we may begin said weyrother hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of brunn was spread out 
 kutuzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound of voice he opened his one eye with an effort 
 yes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye 
 if at first the members of the council thought that kutuzov was pretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kutuzov and having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in a loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle under a heading which he also read out 
 dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and sokolnitz november 
 the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began as follows 
 as the left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it is advantageous to attack the latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the front for this object it is necessary that the first column marches the second column marches the third column marches and so on read weyrother 
 the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions the tall general buxhowden stood leaning his back against the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother with his glistening eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose his elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shoulders raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at face and only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished reading then miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next to weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his elbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be so good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity turned round to miloradovich as if seeking an explanation but meeting the impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox 
 a geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough to be heard 
 przebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness held his hand to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in attention dohkturov a little man sat opposite weyrother with an assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohkturov noted them down 
 when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or at anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the position was assumed to be known whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show general weyrother who had read his dispositions with as much as if he were addressing school children that he had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something in military matters 
 when the monotonous sound of voice ceased kutuzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking so you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again and let his head sink still lower 
 langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting vanity as author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might 
 if he could attack us he would have done so today said he 
 so you think he is powerless said langeron 
 he has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case 
 in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support to miloradovich who was near him 
 but miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about 
 ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield 
 weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but had also convinced the sovereign emperors of 
 the enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp said he what does that mean either he is retreating which is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position he smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in the thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same 
 how is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts 
 kutuzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generals 
 gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrow or rather for today for it is past midnight cannot now be altered said he you have heard them and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is nothing more important he paused than to have a good sleep 
 he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was past midnight prince andrew went out 
 the council of war at which prince andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasy impression whether dolgorukov and weyrother or kutuzov langeron and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were right he did not know but was it really not possible for kutuzov to state his views plainly to the emperor is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life my life he thought must be risked 
 yes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he thought and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distant most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when he first loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with nesvitski and began to walk up and down before it

 book three 
 chapter xii 
 
 shortly after nine that evening weyrother drove with his plans to quarters where the council of war was to be held all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in and with the exception of prince bagration who declined to come were all there at the appointed time 
 weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to weyrother had been twice that evening to the picket line to reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and austrian to report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrived at 
 he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly without looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply to questions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful weary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty and 
 kutuzov was occupying a castle of modest dimensions near ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander in office were gathered kutuzov himself weyrother and the members of the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaited prince bagration to begin the council at last orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and availing himself of permission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at the council he remained in the room 
 since prince bagration is not coming we may begin said weyrother hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of brunn was spread out 
 kutuzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound of voice he opened his one eye with an effort 
 yes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye 
 if at first the members of the council thought that kutuzov was pretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kutuzov and having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in a loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle under a heading which he also read out 
 dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and sokolnitz november 
 the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began as follows 
 as the left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it is advantageous to attack the latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the front for this object it is necessary that the first column marches the second column marches the third column marches and so on read weyrother 
 the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions the tall general buxhowden stood leaning his back against the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother with his glistening eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose his elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shoulders raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at face and only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished reading then miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next to weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his elbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be so good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity turned round to miloradovich as if seeking an explanation but meeting the impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the ice maiden 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we will pay a visit to switzerland and wander through that 
 country of mountains whose steep and rocky sides are overgrown with forest trees let us climb to the dazzling at their 
 summits and descend again to the green meadows beneath through which rivers and brooks rush along as if they could not quickly enough reach the sea and vanish fiercely shines the sun over those deep valleys as well as upon the heavy masses of snow which lie on the mountains 
 
 during the year these accumulations thaw or fall in the rolling 
 avalance or are piled up in shining glaciers two of these glaciers 
 lie in the broad rocky cliffs between the schreckhorn and the 
 wetterhorn near the little town of grindelwald they are wonderful to 
 behold and therefore in the summer time strangers come here from 
 all parts of the world to see them they cross mountains and travel through the deep valleys or ascend for hours higher and still higher the valleys appearing to sink lower and lower as they proceed and become as small as if seen from an air balloon 
 over the lofty summits of these mountains the clouds often hang like a dark veil while beneath in the valley where many brown wooden houses are scattered about the bright rays of the sun may be shining upon a little brilliant patch of green making it appear almost 
 transparent the waters foam and dash along in the valleys beneath 
 the streams from above trickle and murmur as they fall down the 
 rocky side looking like glittering silver bands 
 
 on both sides of the stand these little wooden 
 houses and as within there are many children and many mouths to 
 feed each house has its own little potato garden these children rush 
 out in swarms and surround travellers whether on foot or in 
 carriages they are all clever at making a bargain they offer for 
 sale the sweetest little models of the mountain cottages 
 in switzerland whether it be rain or sunshine these crowds of 
 children are always to be seen with their wares 
 
 about twenty years ago there might be seen occasionally standing 
 at a short distance from the other children a little boy who was 
 also anxious to sell his curious wares he had an earnest 
 expressive countenance and held the box containing his carved toys 
 tightly with both hands as if unwilling to part with it his 
 earnest look and being also a very little boy made him noticed by 
 the strangers so that he often sold the most without knowing why 
 an walk farther up the ascent lived his grandfather who cut and carved the pretty little and in the old room stood a large press full of all sorts of carved things 
 knives and forks boxes with beautifully carved foliage leaping 
 chamois it contained everything that could delight the eyes of a 
 child but the boy who was named rudy looked with still greater 
 pleasure and longing at some old which hung upon the 
 rafters under the ceiling of the room his grandfather promised him 
 that he should have them some day but that he must first grow big and strong and learn how to use them small as he was the goats were placed in his care and a good should also be a good climber and such rudy was he sometimes indeed climbed higher than the goats for he was fond of seeking for at the top of high trees he was bold and daring but was seldom seen to smile excepting when he stood by the roaring cataract or heard the 
 descending roll of the avalanche he never played with the other 
 children and was not seen with them unless his grandfather sent 
 him down to sell his curious workmanship rudy did not much like 
 trade he loved to climb the mountains or to sit by his grandfather 
 and listen to his tales of olden times or of the people in meyringen 
 the place of his birth 
 
 in the early ages of the world said the old man these people could not be found in switzerland they are a colony from the 
 north where their ancestors still dwell and are called swedes 
 this was something for rudy to know but he learnt more from other 
 sources particularly from the domestic animals who belonged to the 
 house one was a large dog called ajola which had belonged to his 
 father and the other was a this cat stood very high in 
 favor for he had taught him to climb 
 
 come out on the roof with me said the cat and rudy quite 
 understood him for the language of fowls ducks cats and dogs is 
 as easily understood by a young child as his own native tongue but it 
 must be at the age when stick becomes a neighing 
 horse with head legs and tail some children retain these ideas 
 later than others and they are considered backwards and childish 
 for their age people say so but is it so 
 
 come out on the roof with me little rudy was the first thing 
 he heard the cat say and rudy understood him what people say 
 about falling down is all nonsense continued the cat you will 
 not fall unless you are afraid come now set one foot here and 
 another there and feel your way with your keep your eyes 
 wide open and move softly and if you come to a hole jump over it 
 and cling fast as i do and this was just what rudy did he was often on the sloping roof with the cat or on the tops of high trees but more frequently higher still on the ridges of the rocks where puss never came 
 
 higher higher cried the trees and the bushes see to what 
 height we have grown and how fast we hold even to the narrow edges of the rocks 
 
 rudy often reached the top of the mountain before the sunrise and 
 there inhaled his morning draught of the fresh invigorating 
 mountain air own gift which men call the sweet fragrance of 
 plant and herb on the and the mint and wild thyme in 
 the valleys the overhanging clouds absorb all heaviness from the air 
 and the winds convey them away over the summits the 
 spirit of fragrance light and fresh remained behind and this was 
 morning draught the sunbeams those 
 daughters of the sun kissed his cheeks vertigo might be lurking on 
 the watch but he dared not approach him the swallows who had not less than seven nests in his house flew up to him and his goats singing we and you you and we they brought him 
 greetings from his house even from two hens the only 
 birds of the household but rudy was not intimate with them 
 
 although so young and such a little fellow rudy had travelled a 
 great deal he was born in the canton of valais and brought to his 
 grandfather over the mountains he had walked to staubbach a little 
 town that seems to flutter in the air like a silver veil the 
 glittering mountain jungfrau he had also been to the great 
 glaciers but this is connected with a sad story for here his 
 mother met her death and his grandfather used to say that all 
 childish merriment was lost from that time his mother had 
 written in a letter that before he was a year old he had laughed more 
 than he cried but after his fall into the crevasse 
 his disposition had completely changed the grandfather seldom spoke of this but the fact was generally known father had been a postilion and the large dog which now lived in his cottage had always followed him on his journeys over the simplon to the lake of geneva relations on his side lived in the canton of valais in the valley of the rhone his uncle was a chamois hunter and a guide rudy was only a year old when his father died and his mother was anxious to return with her child to her own relations who lived in the bernese oberland her father dwelt at a few hours distance from grindelwald he was a carver in wood and gained so much by it that he had plenty to live upon she set out homewards in the month of june carrying her infant in her arms and accompanied by two chamois hunters crossed the gemmi on her way to grindelwald they had already left more than half the journey behind them they had crossed high ridges and traversed they could even see her native valley with its familiar wooden cottages they had only one more glacier to climb 
 
 some newly fallen snow concealed a cleft which though it did not 
 extend to the foaming waters in the depths beneath was still much 
 deeper than the height of a man the young woman with the child in 
 her arms slipped upon it sank in and disappeared not a shriek not 
 a groan was heard nothing but the whining of a little child more 
 than an hour elapsed before her two companions could obtain from the nearest house ropes and poles to assist in raising them and it was 
 with much exertion that they at last succeeded in raising from the 
 crevasse what appeared to be two dead bodies every means was used to restore them to life with the child they were successful but 
 not with the mother so the old grandfather received his 
 little son into his house an orphan a little boy who laughed more 
 than he cried but it seemed as if laughter had left him in the cold 
 into which he had fallen where as the swiss peasants 
 say the souls of the lost are confined till the 
 
 the glaciers appear as if a rushing stream had been frozen in 
 its course and pressed into blocks of green crystal which 
 balanced one upon another form a wondrous palace of crystal for the ice maiden the queen of the glaciers it is she whose mighty power can crush the traveller to death and arrest the flowing river in 
 its course she is also a child of the air and with the swiftness 
 of the chamois she can reach the mountain tops where the boldest mountaineer has to cut footsteps in the ice to ascend she 
 will sail on a frail over the raging torrents beneath and 
 spring lightly from one iceberg to another with her long 
 hair flowing around her and her robe glittering 
 like the waters of the deep swiss lakes mine is the power to seize 
 and crush she cried once a beautiful boy was stolen from me by 
 man a boy whom i had kissed but had not kissed to death he is 
 again among mankind and tends the goats on the mountains he is 
 always climbing higher and higher far away from all others but not 
 from me he is mine i will send for him and she gave vertigo the 
 commission 
 
 it was summer and the ice maiden was melting amidst the green 
 verdure when vertigo swung himself up and down vertigo has many 
 brothers quite a troop of them and the ice maiden chose the 
 strongest among them they exercise their power in different ways and everywhere some sit on the banisters of steep stairs others on the outer rails of lofty towers or spring like squirrels along the ridges 
 of the mountains others tread the air as a swimmer treads the 
 water and lure their victims here and there till they fall into the 
 deep abyss vertigo and the ice maiden clutch at human beings as 
 the polypus seizes upon all that comes within its reach and now 
 vertigo was to seize rudy 
 
 seize him indeed cried vertigo i cannot do it that 
 monster of a cat has taught him her tricks that child of the human 
 race has a power within him which keeps me at a distance i cannot 
 possibly reach the boy when he hangs from the branches of trees 
 over the precipice or i would gladly tickle his feet and send him 
 heels over head through the air but i cannot accomplish it 
 
 we must accomplish it said the ice maiden either you or i 
 must and i will i will 
 
 no no sounded through the air like an echo on the mountain 
 church bells chime it was an answer in song in the melting tones 
 of a chorus from others of spirits good and loving 
 spirits the daughters of the sunbeam they who place themselves in 
 a circle every evening on the mountain peaks there they spread out 
 their wings which as the sun sinks become more flaming red until the lofty alps seem to burn with fire men call this the alpine glow after the sun has set they disappear within the white 
 snow on the and slumber there till sunrise when they 
 again come forth they have great love for flowers for butterflies 
 and for mankind and from among the latter they had chosen little 
 rudy you shall not catch him you shall not seize him they sang 
 greater and stronger than he have i seized said the ice maiden 
 then the daughters of the sun sang a song of the traveller 
 whose cloak had been carried away by the wind the wind took the 
 covering but not the man it could even seize upon him but not 
 hold him fast the children of strength are more powerful more 
 ethereal even than we are they can rise higher than our parent 
 the sun they have the magic words that rule the wind and the waves 
 and compel them to serve and obey and they can at last cast off the 
 heavy oppressive weight of mortality and soar upwards thus sweetly sounded the tones of the chorus 
 
 and each morning the rays shone through the one little 
 window of the house upon the quiet child the 
 daughters of the sunbeam kissed him they wished to thaw and melt 
 and obliterate the ice kiss which the queenly maiden of the glaciers 
 had given him as he lay in the lap of his dead mother in the deep 
 crevasse of ice from which he had been so wonderfully rescued 
 
 ii the journey to the new home 
 rudy was just eight years old when his uncle who lived on the 
 other side of the mountain wished to have the boy as he thought he 
 might obtain a better education with him and learn something more 
 his grandfather thought the same so he consented to let him go 
 rudy had many to say farewell to as well as his grandfather first 
 there was ajola the old dog 
 
 your father was the postilion and i was the dog 
 said ajola we have often travelled the same journey together i knew all the dogs and men on this side of the mountain it is not my 
 habit to talk much but now that we have so little time to converse 
 together i will say something more than usual i will relate to you a 
 story which i have reflected upon for a long time i do not 
 understand it and very likely you will not but that is of no 
 consequence i have however learnt from it that in this world things 
 are not equally divided neither for dogs nor for men all are not 
 born to lie on the lap and to drink milk i have never been petted 
 in this way but i have seen a little dog seated in the place of a 
 gentleman or lady and travelling inside a the lady 
 who was his mistress or of whom he was master carried a bottle of 
 milk of which the little dog now and then drank she also offered him 
 pieces of sugar to crunch he sniffed at them proudly but would not 
 eat one so she ate them herself i was running along the dirty road 
 by the side of the carriage as hungry as a dog could be chewing the 
 cud of my own thoughts which were rather in confusion but many other things seemed in confusion also why was not i lying on a lap and travelling in a coach i could not tell yet i knew i could not 
 alter my own condition either by barking or growling 
 
 this was farewell speech and rudy threw his arms round 
 the neck and kissed his cold nose then he took the cat in his 
 arms but he struggled to get free 
 
 you are getting too strong for me he said but i will not 
 use my claws against you clamber away over the mountains it was i 
 who taught you to climb do not fancy you are going to fall and you 
 will be quite safe then the cat jumped down and ran away he did not wish rudy to see that there were tears in his eyes 
 
 the hens were hopping about the floor one of them had no tail 
 a traveller who fancied himself a sportsman had shot off her tail 
 he had mistaken her for a bird of prey 
 
 rudy is going away over the mountains said one of the hens 
 he is always in such a hurry said the other and i 
 like taking leave so they both hopped out 
 
 but the goats said farewell they bleated and wanted to go with 
 him they were so very sorry 
 
 just at this time two clever guides were going to cross the 
 mountains to the other side of the gemmi and rudy was to go with them on foot it was a long walk for such a little boy but he had plenty of strength and invincible courage the swallows flew with him a little way singing we and you you and we the way led across 
 the rushing lutschine which falls in numerous streams from the dark 
 clefts of the grindelwald glaciers trunks of fallen trees and 
 blocks of stone form bridges over these streams after passing a 
 forest of alders they began to ascend passing by some blocks of 
 ice that had loosened themselves from the side of the mountain and lay across their path they had to step over these or walk 
 round them rudy crept here and ran there his eyes sparkling with 
 joy and he stepped so firmly with his mountain shoe that 
 he left a mark behind him wherever he placed his foot 
 
 the earth was black where the mountain torrents or the melted 
 ice had poured upon it but the bluish green glassy ice sparkled 
 and glittered they had to go round little pools like lakes enclosed 
 between large masses of ice and while thus wandering out of their 
 path they came near an immense stone which lay balanced on the 
 edge of an icy peak the stone lost its balance just as they reached 
 it and rolled over into the abyss beneath while the noise of its 
 fall was echoed back from every hollow cliff of the glaciers 
 
 they were always going upwards the glaciers seemed to spread 
 above them like a continued chain of masses of ice piled up in wild 
 confusion between bare and rugged rocks rudy thought for a moment of what had been told him that he and his mother had once lain buried in one of these cold fissures but he soon banished such thoughts and looked upon the story as fabulous like many other stories which had been told him once or twice when the men thought the way was rather difficult for such a little boy they 
 held out their hands to assist him but he would not accept their 
 assistance for he stood on the slippery ice as firmly as if he had 
 been a chamois they came at length to rocky ground sometimes 
 stepping upon stones sometimes passing beneath stunted and again through green meadows the landscape was always changing but ever above them towered the lofty mountains whose names not only rudy but every other child knew the jungfrau the monk and the eiger 
 
 rudy had never been so far away before he had never trodden on 
 the ocean of snow that lay here with its immovable 
 billows from which the wind blows off the snowflake now and then 
 as it cuts the foam from the waves of the sea the glaciers stand here 
 so close together it might almost be said they are and 
 each is a crystal palace for the ice maiden whose power and will it 
 is to seize and imprison the unwary traveller 
 
 the sun shone warmly and the snow sparkled as if covered with 
 glittering diamonds numerous insects especially butterflies and 
 bees lay dead in heaps on the snow they had ventured too high or 
 the wind had carried them here and left them to die of cold 
 
 around the wetterhorn hung a feathery cloud like a woolbag and a 
 threatening cloud too for as it sunk lower it increased in size 
 and concealed within was a fohn fearful in its violence should it 
 break loose this journey with its varied incidents the wild paths 
 the night passed on the mountain the steep rocky precipices the 
 hollow clefts in which the rustling waters from time immemorial had 
 worn away passages for themselves through blocks of stone all 
 these were firmly impressed on memory 
 
 in a forsaken stone building which stood just beyond the seas 
 of snow they one night took shelter here they found some charcoal 
 and pine branches so that they soon made a fire they arranged 
 couches to lie on as well as they could and then the men seated 
 themselves by the fire took out their pipes and began to smoke 
 they also prepared a warm spiced drink of which they partook and rudy was not forgotten he had his share then they began to talk of those mysterious beings with which the land of the alps abounds the hosts of apparitions which come in the night and carry off the sleepers through the air to the wonderful floating town of venice of the wild who drives the black sheep across the meadows 
 these flocks are never seen yet the tinkle of their little bells has often been heard as well as their unearthly bleating rudy listened eagerly but without fear for he knew not what fear meant and while he 
 listened he fancied he could hear the roaring of the spectral herd 
 it seemed to come nearer and roar louder till the men heard it also 
 and listened in silence till at length they told rudy that he 
 must not dare to sleep it was a fohn that violent which 
 rushes from the mountain to the valley beneath and in its fury 
 snaps asunder the trunks of large trees as if they were but slender 
 reeds and carries the wooden houses from one side of a river to the 
 other as easily as we could move the pieces on a after an hour had passed they told rudy that it was all over and he might 
 go to sleep and fatigued with his long walk he readily slept at the 
 word of command 
 
 very early the following morning they again set out the sun on 
 this day lighted up for rudy new mountains new glaciers and new 
 they had entered the canton valais and found 
 themselves on the ridge of the hills which can be seen from 
 grindelwald but he was still far from his new home they pointed 
 out to him other clefts other meadows other woods and rocky paths and other houses strange men made their appearance before him and what men they were misshapen creatures with yellow complexions and on their necks were dark ugly lumps of flesh hanging down like bags they were called cretins they dragged themselves along painfully and stared at the strangers with vacant eyes the women looked more dreadful than the men poor rudy were these the sort of people he should see at his new home 
 
 iii the uncle 
 rudy arrived at last at his house and was thankful to 
 find the people like those he had been accustomed to see there was 
 only one cretin amongst them a poor idiot boy one of those 
 unfortunate beings who in their neglected conditions go from house 
 to house and are received and taken care of in different families 
 for a month or two at a time 
 
 poor saperli had just arrived at his house when rudy came 
 the uncle was an experienced hunter he also followed the trade of a 
 cooper his wife was a lively little person with a face like a 
 bird eyes like those of an eagle and a long hairy throat 
 everything was new to rudy the fashion of the dress the manners the employments and even the language but the latter his childish ear 
 would soon learn he saw also that there was more wealth here when 
 compared with his former home at his the rooms were 
 larger the walls were adorned with the horns of the chamois and 
 brightly polished guns over the door hung a painting of the virgin 
 mary fresh alpine roses and a burning lamp stood near it 
 uncle was as we have said one of the most noted chamois hunters in 
 the whole district and also one of the best guides rudy soon 
 became the pet of the house but there was another pet an old 
 hound blind and lazy who would never more follow the hunt well as 
 he had once done so but his former good qualities were not forgotten and therefore the animal was kept in the family and treated with every indulgence rudy stroked the old hound but he did not like strangers and rudy was as yet a stranger he did not however long remain so he soon endeared himself to every heart and became like one of the family 
 
 we are not very badly off here in the canton valais said his 
 uncle one day we have the chamois they do not die so fast as the 
 wild goats and it is certainly much better here now than in former 
 times how highly the old times have been spoken of but ours is 
 better the bag has been opened and a current of air now blows 
 through our once confined valley something better always makes its 
 appearance when old things fail 
 
 when his uncle became communicative he would relate stories of 
 his youthful days and farther back still of the warlike times in 
 which his father had lived valais was then as he expressed it 
 only a bag quite full of sick people miserable cretins 
 but the french soldiers came and they were capital doctors they soon killed the disease and the sick people too the french people knew how to fight in more ways than one and the girls knew how to 
 conquer too and when he said this the uncle nodded at his wife who 
 was a french woman by birth and laughed the french could also do battle on the stones it was they who cut a road out of the solid 
 rock over the simplon such a road that i need only say to a child of 
 three years old go down to italy you have only to keep in the 
 high road and the child will soon arrive in italy if he followed my 
 directions 
 
 then the uncle sang a french song and cried hurrah long live 
 napoleon buonaparte this was the first time rudy had ever heard of france or of lyons that great city on the rhone where his uncle 
 had once lived his uncle said that rudy in a very few years would 
 become a clever hunter he had quite a talent for it he taught the 
 boy to hold a gun properly and to load and fire it in the hunting 
 season he took him to the hills and made him drink the warm blood 
 of the chamois which is said to prevent the hunter from becoming 
 giddy he taught him to know the time when from the different 
 mountains the avalanche is likely to fall namely at noontide or 
 in the evening from the effects of the rays he made him 
 observe the movements of the chamois when he gave a leap so that he might fall firmly and lightly on his feet he told him that when on 
 the fissures of the rocks he could find no place for his feet he must 
 support himself on his elbows and cling with his legs and even 
 lean firmly with his back for this could be done when necessary he 
 told him also that the chamois are very cunning they place 
 on the watch but the hunter must be more cunning than 
 they are and find them out by the scent 
 
 one day when rudy went out hunting with his uncle he hung a coat 
 and hat on an alpine staff and the chamois mistook it for a man as 
 they generally do the mountain path was narrow here indeed it was 
 scarcely a path at all only a kind of shelf close to the yawning 
 abyss the snow that lay upon it was partially thawed and the 
 stones crumbled beneath the feet every fragment of stone broken off 
 struck the sides of the rock in its fall till it rolled into the 
 depths beneath and sunk to rest upon this shelf uncle laid 
 himself down and crept forward at about a hundred paces behind him stood rudy upon the highest point of the rock watching a great 
 vulture hovering in the air with a single stroke of his wing the bird 
 might easily cast the creeping hunter into the abyss beneath and make 
 him his prey uncle had eyes for nothing but the chamois 
 who with its young kid had just appeared round the edge of the rock 
 
 so rudy kept his eyes fixed on the bird he knew well what the great 
 creature wanted therefore he stood in readiness to discharge his 
 gun at the proper moment suddenly the chamois made a spring and 
 his uncle fired and struck the animal with the deadly bullet while 
 the young kid rushed away as if for a long life he had been 
 accustomed to danger and practised flight the large bird alarmed 
 at the report of the gun wheeled off in another direction and 
 uncle was saved from danger of which he knew nothing till he was told of it by the boy 
 
 while they were both in pleasant mood wending their way 
 homewards and the uncle whistling the tune of a song he had learnt in 
 his young days they suddenly heard a peculiar sound which seemed to come from the top of the mountain they looked up and saw above them on the rock the heave and lift itself as a piece of linen stretched on the ground to dry raises itself when the wind creeps under it smooth as polished marble slabs the waves of snow cracked and loosened themselves and then suddenly with the rumbling noise of distant thunder fell like a foaming cataract into the abyss an avalanche had fallen not upon rudy and his uncle but very near them alas a great deal too near 
 
 hold fast rudy cried his uncle hold fast with all your 
 might 
 
 then rudy clung with his arms to the trunk of the nearest tree 
 while his uncle climbed above him and held fast by the branches 
 the avalanche rolled past them at some distance but the gust of 
 wind that followed like the of the avalanche snapped 
 asunder the trees and bushes over which it swept as if they had 
 been but dry rushes and threw them about in every direction the tree to which rudy clung was thus overthrown and rudy dashed to the ground the higher branches were snapped off and carried away to a great distance and among these shattered branches lay uncle with his skull fractured when they found him his hand was still warm but it would have been impossible to recognize his face 
 rudy stood by pale and trembling it was the first shock of his life 
 the first time he had ever felt fear late in the evening he 
 returned home with the fatal news to that home which was now to be so full of sorrow his wife uttered not a word nor shed a 
 tear till the corpse was brought in then her agony burst forth 
 
 the poor cretin crept away to his bed and nothing was seen of him 
 during the whole of the following day towards evening however he 
 came to rudy and said will you write a letter for me saperli 
 cannot write saperli can only take the letters to the post 
 
 a letter for you said rudy who do you wish to write to 
 
 to the lord christ he replied 
 
 what do you mean asked rudy 
 
 then the poor idiot as the cretin was often called looked at 
 rudy with a most touching expression in his eyes clasped his hands 
 and said solemnly and devoutly saperli wants to send a letter to 
 jesus christ to pray him to let saperli die and not the master of 
 the house here 
 
 rudy pressed his hand and replied a letter would not reach 
 him up above it would not give him back whom we have lost 
 it was not however easy for rudy to convince saperli of the 
 impossibility of doing what he wished 
 
 now you must work for us said his and rudy 
 very soon became the entire support of the house 
 
 babette 
 iv babette 
 who was the best marksman in the canton valais the chamois knew 
 well save yourselves from rudy they might well say and who is the handsomest marksman oh it is rudy said the maidens but they did not say save yourselves from rudy neither did anxious 
 mothers say so for he bowed to them as pleasantly as to the young 
 girls he was so brave and cheerful his cheeks were brown his 
 teeth white and his eyes dark and sparkling he was now a handsome 
 young man of twenty years the most icy water could not deter him from swimming he could twist and turn like a fish none could climb like he and he clung as firmly to the edges of the rocks as a limpet he had strong muscular power as could be seen when he leapt from rock to rock he had learnt this first from the cat and more lately from the chamois rudy was considered the best guide over the mountains every one had great confidence in him he might have made a great deal of money as guide his uncle had also taught him the trade of a cooper but he had no inclination for either his delight was in which also brought him plenty of money 
 rudy would be a very good match as people said if he would not look above his own station he was also such a famous partner in dancing that the girls often dreamt about him and one and another thought of him even when awake 
 
 he kissed me in the dance said annette the 
 daughter to her dearest friend but she ought not to have told 
 this even to her dearest friend it is not easy to keep such secrets 
 they are like sand in a sieve they slip out it was therefore soon 
 known that rudy so brave and so good as he was had kissed some one while dancing and yet he had never kissed her who was dearest to him 
 
 ah ah said an old hunter he has kissed annette has he he 
 has begun with a and i suppose he will kiss through the whole 
 alphabet 
 
 but a kiss in the dance was all the busy tongues could accuse 
 him of he certainly had kissed annette but she was not the flower of 
 his heart 
 
 down in the valley near bex among the great by the 
 side of a little rushing lived a rich miller his 
 was a large building three storeys high with little 
 turrets the roof was covered with chips bound together with tin 
 plates that glittered in sunshine and in the moonlight the largest 
 of the turrets had a representing an apple pierced by 
 a glittering arrow in memory of william tell the mill was a neat and 
 place that allowed itself to be sketched and written 
 about but the daughter did not permit any to sketch or write 
 about her so at least rudy would have said for her image was 
 pictured in his heart her eyes shone in it so brightly that quite 
 a flame had been kindled there and like all other fires it had 
 burst forth so suddenly that the daughter the beautiful 
 babette was quite unaware of it rudy had never spoken a word to 
 her on the subject the miller was rich and on that account babette 
 stood very high and was rather difficult to aspire to but said 
 rudy to himself nothing is too high for a man to reach he must 
 climb with confidence in himself and he will not fail he had learnt 
 this lesson in his youthful home 
 
 it happened once that rudy had some business to settle at bex 
 it was a long journey at that time for the railway had not been 
 opened from the glaciers of the rhone at the foot of the simplon 
 between its mountain summits stretches the valley of 
 the canton valais through it runs the noble river of the rhone which 
 often overflows its banks covering fields and highways and 
 destroying everything in its course near the towns of sion and st 
 maurice the valley takes a turn and bends like an elbow and 
 behind st maurice becomes so narrow that there is only space enough for the bed of the river and a narrow an old tower stands here as if it were guardian to the canton valais which ends at this point and from it we can look across the stone bridge to 
 the on the other side where the canton vaud commences not far from this spot stands the town of bex and at every step can be seen an increase of fruitfulness and verdure it is like entering a 
 grove of chestnut and here and there the cypress and 
 pomegranate blossoms peep forth and it is almost as warm as an 
 italian climate rudy arrived at bex and soon finished the business 
 which had brought him there and then walked about the town but not even the boy could be seen nor any one belonging to the 
 mill not to mention babette this did not please him at all 
 
 evening came on the air was filled with the perfume of the wild thyme and the blossoms of the and the green woods on the mountains seemed to be covered with a shining veil blue as the sky 
 
 over everything reigned a stillness not of sleep or of death but 
 as if nature were holding her breath that her image might be 
 photographed on the blue vault of heaven here and there amidst the 
 trees of the silent valley stood poles which supported the wires of 
 the electric telegraph against one of these poles leaned an object so 
 motionless that it might have been mistaken for the trunk of a tree 
 but it was rudy standing there as still as at that moment was 
 everything around him he was not asleep neither was he dead but 
 just as the various events in the world matters of momentous 
 importance to individuals were flying through the telegraph wires 
 without the quiver of a wire or the slightest tone so through the 
 mind of rudy thoughts of overwhelming importance were passing 
 without an outward sign of emotion the happiness of his future life 
 depended upon the decision of his present reflections his eyes were 
 fixed on one spot in the distance a light that twinkled through the 
 foliage from the parlor of the house where babette dwelt 
 
 rudy stood so still that it might have been supposed he was 
 watching for a chamois but he was in reality like a chamois who will 
 stand for a moment looking as if it were chiselled out of the rock 
 and then if only a stone rolled by would suddenly bound forward with a spring far away from the hunter and so with rudy a sudden roll of his thoughts roused him from his stillness and made him bound forward with determination to act 
 
 never despair cried he a visit to the mill to say good 
 evening to the miller and good evening to little babette can do no 
 harm no one ever fails who has confidence in himself if i am to be 
 husband i must see her some time or other 
 
 then rudy laughed joyously and took courage to go to the mill he 
 knew what he wanted he wanted to marry babette the clear water of 
 the river rolled over its yellow bed and willows and 
 were reflected in it as rudy stepped along the path to the 
 house but as the children sing 
 there was no one at home in the house 
 only a kitten at play 
 the cat standing on the steps put up its back and cried mew but 
 rudy had no inclination for this sort of conversation he passed on 
 and knocked at the door no one heard him no one opened the door 
 mew said the cat again and had rudy been still a child he would 
 have understood this language and known that the cat wished to tell 
 him there was no one at home so he was obliged to go to the mill 
 and make inquiries and there he heard that the miller had gone on a 
 journey to interlachen and taken babette with him to the great 
 shooting festival which began that morning and would continue for 
 eight days and that people from all the german settlements would be 
 there 
 
 poor rudy we may well say it was not a fortunate day for his 
 visit to bex he had just to return the way he came through st 
 maurice and sion to his home in the valley but he did not despair 
 when the sun rose the next morning his good spirits had returned 
 indeed he had never really lost them babette is at interlachen 
 said rudy to himself many days journey from here it is certainly a 
 long way for any one who takes the but not so far if he 
 takes a short cut across the mountain and that just suits a 
 i have been that way before for it leads to the 
 home of my childhood where as a little boy i lived with my 
 grandfather and there are shooting matches at interlachen i will go 
 and try to stand first in the match babette will be there and i 
 shall be able to make her acquaintance 
 
 carrying his light knapsack which contained his sunday clothes 
 on his back and with his musket and his over his shoulder 
 rudy started to take the shortest way across the mountain still it 
 was a great distance the shooting matches were to commence on that day and to continue for a whole week he had been told also that 
 the miller and babette would remain that time with some relatives at 
 interlachen so over the gemmi rudy climbed bravely and determined to descend the side of the grindelwald bright and joyous were his feelings as he stepped lightly onwards inhaling the invigorating mountain air the valley sunk as he ascended the circle of the horizon expanded one peak after another rose before him till the whole of the glittering alpine range became visible 
 rudy knew each peak and he continued his course towards 
 the schreckhorn with its white powdered stone finger raised high in 
 the air at length he had crossed the highest ridges and before him 
 lay the green pasture lands sloping down towards the valley which was once his home the buoyancy of the air made his heart light hill 
 and valley were blooming in luxuriant beauty and his thoughts were 
 youthful dreams in which old age or death were out of the question 
 life power and enjoyment were in the future and he felt free and 
 light as a bird and the swallows flew round him as in the days of 
 his childhood singing we and you you and we all was overflowing with joy beneath him lay the meadows covered with velvety green with the murmuring river flowing through them and dotted here and there were small wooden houses he could see the edges of the glaciers looking like green glass against the soiled snow and the deep chasms beneath the loftiest glacier the church bells were ringing as if to welcome him to his home with their sweet tones 
 his heart beat quickly and for a moment he seemed to have 
 foregotten babette so full were his thoughts of old recollections he 
 was in imagination once more wandering on the road where when a 
 little boy he with other children came to sell their curiously 
 carved toy houses yonder behind the still stood his 
 house his father but strangers dwelt in it 
 now children came running to him as he had once done and wished 
 to sell their wares one of them offered him an alpine rose rudy took the rose as a good omen and thought of babette he quickly crossed the bridge where the two rivers flow into each other here he found a walk with large and their thick 
 foliage formed a pleasant shade very soon he perceived in the 
 distance waving flags on which glittered a white cross on a red 
 ground the standard of the danes as well as of the swiss and 
 before him lay interlachen 
 
 it is really a splendid town like none other that i have ever 
 seen said rudy to himself it was indeed a swiss town in its holiday 
 dress not like the many other towns crowded with heavy stone houses stiff and foreign looking no here it seemed as if the wooden 
 houses on the hills had run into the valley and placed themselves 
 in rows and ranks by the side of the clear river which rushes like an 
 arrow in its course the streets were rather irregular it is true 
 but still this added to their picturesque appearance there was one 
 street which rudy thought the prettiest of them all it had been built 
 since he had visited the town when a little boy it seemed to him as 
 if all the neatest and most curiously carved toy houses which his 
 grandfather once kept in the large cupboard at home had been 
 brought out and placed in this spot and that they had increased in 
 size since then as the old chestnut trees had done the houses were 
 called hotels the woodwork on the windows and balconies was curiously carved the roofs were gayly painted and before each house was a flower garden which separated it from the macadamized 
 
 these houses all stood on the same side of the road so that the 
 fresh green meadows in which were cows grazing with bells on 
 their necks were not hidden the sound of these bells is often 
 heard amidst alpine scenery these meadows were encircled by lofty 
 hills which receded a little in the centre so that the most 
 beautifully formed of swiss mountains the jungfrau 
 could be distinctly seen glittering in the distance a number of 
 elegantly dressed gentlemen and ladies from foreign lands and 
 crowds of country people from the neighboring cantons were 
 assembled in the town each marksman wore the number of hits he had made twisted in a garland round his hat here were music and singing of all descriptions trumpets shouting and noise the houses and bridges were adorned with verses and inscriptions flags and banners were waving shot after shot was fired which was the best music to ears and amidst all this excitement he quite forgot babette on whose account only he had come the shooters were thronging round the target and rudy was soon amongst them but when he took his turn to fire he proved himself the best shot for he always struck the 
 who may that young stranger be was the inquiry on all sides 
 he speaks french as it is spoken in the swiss cantons 
 and makes himself understood very well when he speaks german 
 said some 
 he lived here when a child with his grandfather in a house 
 on the road to grindelwald remarked one of the sportsmen 
 and full of life was this young stranger his eyes sparkled his 
 glance was steady and his arm sure therefore he always hit the mark 
 good fortune gives courage and rudy was always courageous he soon had a circle of friends gathered round him every one noticed him and did him homage babette had quite vanished from his thoughts when he was struck on the shoulder by a heavy hand and a deep voice said to him in french you are from the canton valais 
 rudy turned round and beheld a man with a ruddy pleasant face 
 and a stout figure it was the rich miller from bex his broad portly 
 person hid the slender lovely babette but she came forward and 
 glanced at him with her bright dark eyes the rich miller was very 
 much flattered at the thought that the young man who was acknowledged to be the best shot and was so praised by every one should be from his own canton now was rudy really fortunate he had travelled all this way to this place and those he had forgotten were now come to seek him when country people go far from home they often meet with those they know and improve their acquaintance rudy by his shooting had gained the first place in the just as the miller at home at bex stood first because of his money and his mill so the two men shook hands which they had never done before 
 
 babette too held out her hand to rudy frankly and he pressed it 
 in his and looked at her so earnestly that she blushed deeply the 
 miller talked of the long journey they had travelled and of the 
 many towns they had seen it was his opinion that he had really made 
 as great a journey as if he had travelled in a steamship a railway 
 carriage or a 
 
 i came by a much shorter way said rudy i came over the 
 mountains there is no road so high that a man may not venture upon 
 it 
 
 ah yes and break your neck said the miller and you look 
 like one who will break his neck some day you are so daring 
 oh nothing ever happens to a man if he has confidence in 
 himself replied rudy 
 
 the relations at interlachen with whom the miller and 
 babette were staying invited rudy to visit them when they found he 
 came from the same canton as the miller it was a most pleasant visit 
 good fortune seemed to follow him as it does those who think and 
 act for themselves and who remember the proverb nuts are given to us but they are not cracked for us and rudy was treated by the 
 relations almost like one of the family and glasses of 
 wine were poured out to drink to the welfare of the best shooter 
 babette clinked glasses with rudy and he returned thanks for the 
 toast in the evening they all took a delightful walk under the 
 in front of the stately hotels there were so many 
 people and such crowding that rudy was obliged to offer his arm to 
 babette then he told her how happy it made him to meet people from the canton vaud for vaud and valais were neighboring cantons he spoke of this pleasure so heartily that babette could not resist giving his arm a slight squeeze and so they walked on together and talked and chatted like old acquaintances rudy felt inclined to laugh sometimes at the absurd dress and walk of the foreign ladies but babette did not wish to make fun of them for she knew there must be some good excellent people amongst them she herself had a godmother who was a english lady eighteen years before when babette was christened this lady was staying at bex and she stood godmother for her and gave her the valuable brooch she now wore in her bosom 
 
 her godmother had twice written to her and this year she was 
 expected to visit interlachen with her two daughters but they are 
 added babette who was only eighteen they are nearly 
 thirty her sweet little mouth was never still a moment and all that 
 she said sounded in ears as matters of the greatest importance and at last he told her what he was longing to tell how often he had been at bex how well he knew the mill and how often he had seen babette when most likely she had not noticed him and lastly that full of many thoughts which he could not tell her he had been to the mill on the evening when she and her father has started on their long journey but not too far for him to find a way to overtake 
 them he told her all this and a great deal more he told her how 
 much he could endure for her and that it was to see her and not 
 the which had brought him to interlachen babette 
 became quite silent after hearing all this it was almost too much 
 and it troubled her 
 
 and while they thus wandered on the sun sunk behind the lofty 
 mountains the jungfrau stood out in brightness and splendor as a 
 to the green woods of the surrounding hills every one 
 stood still to look at the beautiful sight rudy and babette among 
 them 
 
 nothing can be more beautiful than this said babette 
 nothing replied rudy looking at babette 
 i must return home remarked rudy a few minutes 
 afterwards 
 
 come and visit us at bex whispered babette my father will 
 be pleased to see you 
 
 v on the way home 
 oh what a number of things rudy had to carry over the 
 mountains when he set out to return home he had three silver cups 
 two handsome pistols and a silver this latter would be 
 useful when he began housekeeping but all these were not the heaviest weight he had to bear something mightier and more important he carried with him in his heart over the high mountains as he journeyed homeward 
 
 the weather was dismally dark and inclined to rain the clouds 
 hung low like a mourning veil on the tops of the mountains and 
 shrouded their glittering peaks in the woods could be heard the sound of the axe and the heavy fall of the trunks of the trees as they 
 rolled down the slopes of the mountains when seen from the heights 
 the trunks of these trees looked like slender stems but on a nearer 
 inspection they were found to be large and strong enough for the masts of a ship the river murmured monotonously the wind whistled and the 
 clouds sailed along hurriedly 
 suddenly there appeared close by side a young maiden 
 he had not noticed her till she came quite near to him she was also 
 going to ascend the mountain the eyes shone with an 
 unearthly power which obliged you to look into them they were 
 strange eyes clear deep and unfathomable 
 
 hast thou a lover asked rudy all his thoughts were naturally 
 on love just then 
 i have none answered the maiden with a laugh it was as if she 
 had not spoken the truth 
 do not let us go such a long way round said she we must 
 keep to the left it is much shorter 
 
 ah yes he replied and fall into some crevasse do you 
 pretend to be a guide and not know the road better than that 
 
 i know every step of the way said she and my thoughts are 
 collected while yours are down in the valley yonder we should 
 think of the ice maiden while we are up here men say she is not 
 kind to their race 
 
 i fear her not said rudy she could not keep me when i was a 
 child i will not give myself up to her now i am a man 
 darkness came on the rain fell and then it began to snow and 
 the whiteness dazzled the eyes 
 
 give me your hand said the maiden i will help you to 
 mount and he felt the touch of her icy fingers 
 
 you help me cried rudy i do not yet require a woman to help 
 me to climb and he stepped quickly forwards away from her 
 the drifting fell like a veil between them the wind 
 whistled and behind him he could hear the maiden laughing and 
 singing and the sound was most strange to hear 
 
 it certainly must be a spectre or a servant of the ice maiden 
 thought rudy who had heard such things talked about when he was a 
 little boy and had stayed all night on the mountain with the guides 
 
 the snow fell thicker than ever the clouds lay beneath him he 
 looked back there was no one to be seen but he heard sounds of 
 mocking laughter which were not those of a human voice 
 
 when rudy at length reached the highest part of the mountain 
 where the path led down to the valley of the rhone the snow had 
 ceased and in the clear heavens he saw two bright stars twinkling 
 
 they reminded him of babette and of himself and of his future 
 happiness and his heart glowed at the thought 
 vi the visit to the mill 
 what beautiful things you have brought home said his old 
 and her sparkled while 
 she wriggled and twisted her skinny neck more quickly and strangely 
 than ever you have brought good luck with you rudy i must give you a kiss my dear boy 
 
 rudy allowed himself to be kissed but it could be seen by his 
 countenance that he only endured the infliction as a homely duty 
 how handsome you are rudy said the old woman 
 flatter said rudy with a laugh but still he was pleased 
 i must say once more said the old woman that you are very 
 lucky 
 well in that i believe you are right said he as he thought of 
 babette never had he felt such a longing for that deep valley as he 
 now had they must have returned home by this time said he to 
 himself it is already two days over the time which they fixed 
 upon i must go to bex 
 
 so rudy set out to go to bex and when he arrived there he 
 found the miller and his daughter at home they received him kindly 
 and brought him many greetings from their friends at interlachen 
 babette did not say much she seemed to have become quite silent 
 but her eyes spoke and that was quite enough for rudy the miller had generally a great deal to talk about and seemed to expect that 
 every one should listen to his jokes and laugh at them for was not 
 he the rich miller but now he was more inclined to hear 
 adventures while hunting and travelling and to listen to his 
 descriptions of the difficulties the has to overcome on 
 the or of the dangerous which the wind 
 and weather cause to cling to the edges of the rocks or to lie in the 
 form of a frail bridge over the abyss beneath the eyes of the brave 
 rudy sparkled as he described the life of a hunter or spoke of the 
 cunning of the chamois and their wonderful leaps also of the powerful fohn and the rolling avalanche he noticed that the more he described the more interested the miller became especially when he spoke of the fierce vulture and of the royal eagle not far from bex in the canton valais was an nest more curiously built under a high rock in this nest was a young eagle but who would venture to take it a young englishman had offered rudy a whole handful of gold if he would bring him the young eagle alive 
 
 there is a liit to everything was reply the eagle 
 could not be taken it would be folly to attempt it 
 
 the wine was passed round freely and the conversation kept up 
 pleasantly but the evening seemed too short for rudy although it was midnight when he left the house after this his first visit 
 while the lights in the windows of the house still 
 twinkled through the green foliage out through the open skylight came the on to the roof and along the walked the to meet her 
 
 what is the news at the mill asked the here in the 
 house there is secret going on which the father knows 
 nothing about rudy and babette have been treading on each 
 paws under the table all the evening they trod on my tail twice 
 but i did not mew that would have attracted notice 
 
 well i should have mewed said the 
 
 what might suit the kitchen would not suit the parlor said 
 the other i am quite curious to know what the miller will say when 
 he finds out this engagement 
 
 yes indeed what would the miller say rudy himself was anxious 
 to know that but to wait till the miller heard of it from others 
 was out of the question therefore not many days after this visit he 
 was riding in the omnibus that runs between the two cantons valais 
 and vaud these cantons are separated by the rhone over which is a 
 bridge that unites them rudy as usual had plenty of courage and 
 indulged in pleasant thoughts of the favorable answer he should 
 receive that evening and when the omnibus returned rudy was again seated in it going homewards and at the same time the at the house ran out quickly crying 
 
 here you from the kitchen what do you think the miller knows 
 all now everything has come to a delightful end rudy came here 
 this evening and he and babette had much whispering and secret 
 conversation together they stood in the path near the 
 room i lay at their feet but they had no eyes or thoughts for me 
 
 i will go to your father at once said he it is the most 
 honorable way 
 
 shall i go with you asked babette it will give you courage 
 
 i have plenty of courage said rudy but if you are with me 
 he must be friendly whether he says yes or no 
 
 so they turned to go in and rudy trod heavily on my tail he 
 certainly is very clumsy i mewed but neither he nor babette had 
 any ears for me they opened the door and entered together i was 
 before them and jumped on the back of a chair i hardly know what 
 rudy said but the miller flew into a rage and threatened to kick him 
 out of the house he told him he might go to the mountains and look 
 after the chamois but not after our little babette 
 
 and what did they say did they speak asked the 
 what did they say why all that people generally do say when 
 they go i love her and she loves me and when there is 
 milk in the can for one there is milk in the can for two 
 but she is so far above you said the miller she has heaps of 
 gold as you know you should not attempt to reach her 
 there is nothing so high that a man cannot reach if he will 
 answered rudy for he is a brave youth 
 yet you could not reach the young eagle said the miller 
 laughing babette is higher than the nest 
 i will have them both said rudy 
 very well i will give her to you when you bring me the young 
 eaglet alive said the miller and he laughed till the tears stood in 
 his eyes but now i thank you for this visit rudy and if you come 
 you will find nobody at home rudy 
 babette also wished him farewell but her voice sounded as 
 mournful as the mew of a little kitten that has lost its mother 
 a promise is a promise between man and man said rudy do 
 not weep babette i shall bring the young eagle 
 you will break your neck i hope said the miller and we 
 shall be relieved from your company 
 i call that kicking him out of the house said the 
 and now rudy is gone and babette sits and weeps while the miller 
 sings german songs that he learnt on his journey but i do not trouble 
 myself on the matter it would be of no use 
 yet for all that it is a very strange affair said the 
 
 
 vii the nest 
 from the came a joyous sound of some person 
 whistling and it betokened good humor and undaunted courage it was rudy going to meet his friend vesinaud you must come and help said he i want to carry off the young eaglet from the top of the rock we will take young ragli with us 
 
 had you not better first try to take down the moon that would be 
 quite as easy a task said vesinaud you seem to be in good 
 spirits 
 
 yes indeed i am i am thinking of my wedding but to be serious 
 i will tell you all about it and how i am situated 
 
 then he explained to vesinaud and ragli what he wished to do 
 and why 
 
 you are a daring fellow said they but it is no use you 
 will break your neck 
 
 no one falls unless he is afraid said rudy 
 so at midnight they set out carrying with them poles ladders 
 and ropes the road lay amidst brushwood and underwood over rolling stones always upwards higher and higher in the dark night waters roared beneath them or fell in cascades from above humid clouds were driving through the air as the hunters reached the precipitous ledge of the rock it was even darker here for the sides of the rocks almost met and the light penetrated only through a small opening at the top at a little distance from the edge could be heard the sound of the roaring foaming waters in the yawning abyss beneath them 
 
 the three seated themselves on a stone to await in stillness the dawn 
 of day when the parent eagle would fly out as it would be 
 necessary to shoot the old bird before they could think of gaining 
 possession of the young one rudy sat motionless as if he had been 
 part of the stone on which he sat he held his gun ready to fire with 
 his eyes fixed steadily on the highest point of the cliff where the 
 nest lay concealed beneath the overhanging rock 
 
 the three hunters had a long time to wait at last they heard a 
 rustling whirring sound above them and a large hovering object 
 darkened the air two guns were ready to aim at the dark body of the 
 eagle as it rose from the nest then a shot was fired for an 
 instant the bird fluttered its wings and seemed as 
 if it would fill up the whole of the chasm and drag down the 
 hunters in its fall but it was not so the eagle sunk gradually 
 into the abyss beneath and the branches of trees and bushes were 
 broken by its weight then the hunters roused themselves three of the 
 longest ladders were brought and bound together the topmost ring of 
 these ladders would just reach the edge of the rock which hung over 
 the abyss but no farther the point beneath which the nest 
 lay sheltered was much higher and the sides of the rock were as 
 smooth as a wall after consulting together they determined to bind 
 together two more ladders and to hoist them over the cavity and so 
 form a communication with the three beneath them by binding the upper ones to the lower with great difficulty they contrived to drag the two ladders over the rock and there they hung for some moments swaying over the abyss but no sooner had they fastened them together than rudy placed his foot on the lowest step 
 
 it was a bitterly cold morning clouds of mist were rising from 
 beneath and rudy stood on the lower step of the ladder as a fly rests 
 on a piece of swinging straw which a bird may have dropped from the edge of the nest it was building on some tall factory chimney but the fly could fly away if the straw were shaken rudy could only break his neck the wind whistled around him and beneath him the waters of the abyss swelled by the thawing of the glaciers those palaces of the ice maiden foamed and roared in their rapid course 
 when rudy began to ascend the ladder trembled like the web of the spider when it draws out the long delicate threads but as soon as he 
 reached the fourth of the ladders which had been bound together he 
 felt more confidence he knew that they had been fastened securely by skilful hands the fifth ladder that appeared to reach the nest 
 was supported by the sides of the rock yet it swung to and fro and 
 flapped about like a slender reed and as if it had been bound by 
 fishing lines it seemed a most dangerous undertaking to ascend it 
 but rudy knew how to climb he had learnt that from the cat and he 
 had no fear he did not observe vertigo who stood in the air behind 
 him trying to lay hold of him with his outstretched polypous arms 
 when at length he stood on the topmost step of the ladder he 
 found that he was still some distance below the nest and not even 
 able to see into it only by using his hands and climbing could he 
 possibly reach it he tried the strength of the stunted trees and the 
 thick underwood upon which the nest rested and of which it was 
 formed and finding they would support his weight he grasped them 
 firmly and swung himself up from the ladder till his head and 
 breast were above the nest and then what an overpowering stench 
 came from it for in it lay the putrid remains of lambs chamois 
 and birds vertigo although he could not reach him blew the 
 poisonous vapor in his face to make him giddy and faint and beneath in the dark yawning deep on the rushing waters sat the ice 
 maiden with her long pale green hair falling around her and her 
 eyes fixed upon him like the two barrels of a gun i have 
 thee now she cried 
 
 in a corner of the nest sat the young eaglet a large 
 and powerful bird though still unable to fly rudy fixed his eyes 
 upon it held on by one hand with all his strength and with the other 
 threw a noose round the young eagle the string slipped to its legs 
 rudy tightened it and thus secured the bird alive then flinging 
 the sling over his shoulder so that the creature hung a good way down behind him he prepared to descend with the help of a rope and his foot soon touched safely the highest step of the ladder then rudy remembering his early lesson in climbing hold fast and do not fear descended carefully down the ladders and at last stood 
 safely on the ground with the young living eaglet where he was 
 received with loud shouts of joy and congratulations 
 
 viii what fresh news the had to tell 
 there is what you asked for said rudy as he entered the 
 house at bex and placed on the floor a large basket he 
 removed the lid as he spoke and a pair of yellow eyes encircled by a 
 black ring stared forth with a wild fiery glance that seemed 
 ready to burn and destroy all that came in its way its short 
 strong beak was open ready to bite and on its red throat were 
 short feathers like stubble 
 
 the young eaglet cried the miller 
 babette screamed and started back while her eyes wandered from 
 rudy to the bird in astonishment 
 
 you are not to be discouraged by difficulties i see said the 
 miller 
 
 and you will keep your word replied rudy each has his own 
 characteristic whether it is honor or courage 
 
 but how is it you did not break your neck asked the miller 
 
 because i held fast answered rudy and i mean to hold fast 
 to babette 
 
 you must get her first said the miller laughing and babette 
 thought this a very good sign 
 
 we must take the bird out of the basket said she it is 
 getting into a rage how its eyes glare how did you manage to conquer it 
 then rudy had to describe his adventure and the eyes 
 opened wide as he listened 
 with your courage and your good fortune you might win three 
 wives said the miller 
 oh thank you cried rudy 
 but you have not won babette yet said the miller slapping 
 the young alpine hunter on the shoulder playfully 
 have you heard the fresh news at the mill asked the 
 of the rudy has brought us the young eagle 
 and he is to take babette in exchange they kissed each other in the 
 presence of the old man which is as good as an engagement he was 
 quite civil about it drew in his claws and took his afternoon nap 
 so that the two were left to sit and wag their tails as much as they 
 pleased they have so much to talk about that it will not be 
 finished till christmas neither was it finished till christmas 
 
 the wind whirled the faded fallen leaves the snow drifted in the 
 valleys as well as upon the mountains and the ice maiden sat in 
 the stately palace which in winter time she generally occupied 
 
 the perpendicular rocks were covered with slippery ice and where in 
 summer the stream from the rocks had left a watery veil icicles large 
 and heavy hung from the trees while the 
 were decorated with fantastic garlands of crystal the ice maiden rode on the howling wind across the deep valleys the country as far as bex was covered with a carpet of snow so that the ice maiden could follow rudy and see him when he visited the mill and while in the room at the house where he was accustomed to spend so much of his time with babette the wedding was to take place in the 
 following summer and they heard enough of it for so many of their 
 friends spoke of the matter 
 
 then came sunshine to the mill the beautiful alpine roses 
 bloomed and joyous laughing babette was like the early spring 
 which makes all the birds sing of summer time and bridal days 
 
 how those two do sit and chatter together said the 
 i have had enough of their mewing 
 
 ix the ice maiden 
 the walnut and chestnut trees which extend from the bridge of st 
 maurice by the river rhone to the shores of the lake of geneva were already covered with the delicate green garlands of early spring just bursting into bloom while the rhone rushed wildly from its source among the green glaciers which form the ice palace of the ice 
 maiden she sometimes allows herself to be carried by the keen wind to the lofty where she stretches herself in the sunshine 
 on the soft from thence she throws her 
 glance into the deep valley beneath where human beings are busily 
 moving about like ants on a stone in the sun spirits of strength as 
 the children of the sun call you cried the ice maiden ye are but 
 worms let but a roll and you and your houses and your 
 towns are crushed and swept away and she raised her proud head 
 and looked around her with eyes that flashed death from their 
 glance from the valley came a rumbling sound men were busily at work blasting the rocks to form tunnels and laying down roads for the railway they are playing at work underground like moles said she 
 
 they are digging passages beneath the earth and the noise is like 
 the reports of cannons i shall throw down my palaces for the 
 clamor is louder than the roar of thunder then there ascended from 
 the valley a thick vapor which waved itself in the air like a 
 fluttering veil it rose as a plume of feathers from a steam engine 
 to which on the railway a string of carriages was 
 linked carriage to carriage looking like a winding serpent the 
 train shot past with the speed of an arrow they play at being 
 masters down there those spirits of strength exclaimed the ice 
 maiden but the powers of nature are still the rulers and she 
 laughed and sang till her voice sounded through the valley and people 
 said it was the rolling of an avalanche but the children of the sun 
 sang in louder strains in praise of the mind of man which can span 
 the sea as with a yoke can level mountains and fill up valleys it 
 is the power of thought which gives man the mastery over nature 
 just at this moment there came across the where the 
 ice maiden sat a party of travellers they had bound themselves 
 fast to each other so that they looked like one large body on the 
 slippery plains of ice encircling the deep abyss 
 
 worms exclaimed the ice maiden you the lords of the powers 
 of nature and she turned away and looked maliciously at the deep 
 valley where the railway train was rushing by there they sit 
 these thoughts she exclaimed there they sit in their power over 
 strength i see them all one sits proudly apart like a 
 king others sit together in a group yonder half of them are asleep 
 and when the steam dragon stops they will get out and go their way 
 the thoughts go forth into the world and she laughed 
 
 there goes another avalanche said those in the valley beneath 
 
 it will not reach us said two who sat together behind the steam 
 dragon two hearts and one beat as people say they were rudy and babette and the miller was with them i am like the luggage said he i am here as a necessary appendage 
 
 there sit those two said the ice maiden many a chamois have i 
 crushed millions of alpine roses have i snapped and broken off not a root have i spared i know them all and their thoughts those spirits 
 of strength and again she laughed 
 
 there rolls another avalanche said those in the valley 
 
 x the godmother 
 at montreux one of the towns which encircle the northeast part of 
 the lake of geneva lived godmother the noble english lady 
 with her daughters and a young relative they had only lately arrived 
 yet the miller had paid them a visit and informed them of 
 engagement to rudy the whole story of their meeting at interlachen 
 and his brave adventure with the eaglet were related to them and 
 they were all very much interested and as pleased about rudy and 
 babette as the miller himself the three were invited to come to 
 montreux it was but right for babette to become acquainted with her 
 godmother who wished to see her very much a started 
 from the town of villeneuve at one end of the lake of geneva and 
 arrived at bernex a little town beyond montreux in about half an 
 hour and in this boat the miller with his daughter and rudy set 
 out to visit her godmother they passed the coast which has been so 
 celebrated in song here under the by the deep blue 
 lake sat byron and wrote his melodious verses about the prisoner 
 confined in the gloomy castle of chillon here where clarens with 
 its is reflected in the clear water wandered 
 rousseau dreaming of heloise the river rhone glides gently by 
 beneath the lofty hills of savoy and not far from its 
 mouth lies a little island in the lake so small that seen from the 
 shore it looks like a ship the surface of the island is rocky and 
 about a hundred years ago a lady caused the ground to be covered with earth in which three were planted and the whole 
 enclosed with stone walls the now overshadow every 
 part of the island babette was enchanted with the spot it seemed 
 to her the most beautiful object in the whole voyage and she 
 thought how much she should like to land there but the 
 passed it by and did not stop till it reached bernex the little 
 party walked slowly from this place to montreux passing the 
 walls with which the vineyards of the little mountain town of montreux are surrounded and peasants houses overshadowed by with gardens in which grow the laurel and the cypress 
 halfway up the hill stood the in which 
 godmother resided she was received most cordially her godmother 
 was a very friendly woman with a round smiling countenance when a child her head must have resembled one of cherubs it was still an angelic face with its white locks of silvery hair the 
 daughters were tall elegant slender maidens 
 
 the young cousin whom they had brought with them was dressed 
 in white from head to foot he had golden hair and golden whiskers 
 large enough to be divided amongst three gentlemen and he began 
 immediately to pay the greatest attention to babette 
 
 richly bound books and drawings lay on the large 
 table the balcony window stood open and from it could be seen the 
 beautiful wide extended lake the water so clear and still that the 
 mountains of savoy with their villages woods and 
 peaks were clearly reflected in it 
 
 rudy who was usually so lively and brave did not in the least 
 feel himself at home he acted as if he were walking on peas over a 
 slippery floor how long and wearisome the time appeared it was 
 like being in a treadmill and then they went out for a walk which 
 was very slow and tedious two steps forward and one backwards had rudy to take to keep pace with the others they walked down to 
 chillon and went over the old castle on the rocky island they saw 
 the implements of torture the deadly dungeons the rusty fetters in 
 the rocky walls the stone benches for those condemned to death the 
 through which the unhappy creatures were hurled upon iron spikes and impaled alive they called looking at all these a 
 pleasure it certainly was the right place to visit poetry 
 had made it celebrated in the world rudy could only feel that it 
 was a place of execution he leaned against the stone framework of the window and gazed down into the deep blue water and over to the little island with the three acacias and wished himself there away 
 and free from the whole chattering party but babette was most 
 unusually lively and 
 
 i have been so amused she said 
 the cousin had found her quite perfect 
 
 he is a perfect fop said rudy and this was the first time rudy 
 had said anything that did not please babette 
 
 the englishman had made her a present of a little book in 
 remembrance of their visit to chillon it was poem the 
 prisoner of chillon translated into french so that babette could 
 read it 
 
 the book may be very good said rudy but that finely combed 
 fellow who gave it to you is not worth much 
 
 he looks something like a without any flour said the 
 miller laughing at his own wit rudy laughed too for so had he 
 appeared to him 
 
 xi the cousin 
 when rudy went a few days after to pay a visit to the mill he 
 found the young englishman there babette was just thinking of 
 preparing some trout to set before him she understood well how to 
 garnish the dish with parsley and make it look quite tempting rudy 
 thought all this quite unnecessary what did the englishman want 
 there what was he about why should he be entertained and waited 
 upon by babette rudy was jealous and that made babette happy it 
 amused her to discover all the feelings of his heart the strong 
 points and weak ones love was to her as yet only a pastime and she 
 played with whole heart at the same time it must be 
 acknowledged that her fortune her whole life her inmost thoughts 
 her best and most noble feelings in this world were all for him still 
 the more gloomy he looked the more her eyes laughed she could almost have kissed the fair englishman with the golden whiskers if by so doing she could have put rudy in a rage and made him run out of the house that would have proved how much he loved her all this was not right in babette but she was only nineteen years of age and she did not reflect on what she did neither did she think that her 
 conduct would appear to the young englishman as light and not even 
 becoming the modest and daughter of the miller 
 
 the mill at bex stood in the highway which passed under the 
 mountains and not far from a rapid whose waters seemed to have been lashed into a foam like 
 this stream however did not pass near enough to the mill and therefore the was turned by a smaller stream which tumbled down the rocks on the opposite side where it was opposed by a stone and obtained greater strength and speed till it fell into a large basin and from thence through a channel to the 
 this channel sometimes overflowed and made the path so slippery that any one passing that way might easily fall in and be carried towards the mill wheel with frightful rapidity such a catastrophe nearly happened to the young englishman he had dressed himself in white clothes like a man and was climbing the path to the 
 house but he had never been taught to climb and therefore 
 slipped and nearly went in he managed however to 
 scramble out with wet sleeves and bespattered trousers still wet and 
 splashed with mud he contrived to reach window to which he had been guided by the light that shone from it here he climbed the old that stood near it and began to imitate the voice 
 of an owl the only bird he could venture to mimic babette heard 
 the noise and glanced through the thin window curtain but when she 
 saw the man in white and guessed who he was her little heart beat 
 with terror as well as anger she quickly put out the light felt if 
 the fastening of the window was secure and then left him to howl as 
 long as he liked how dreadful it would be thought babette if rudy 
 were here in the house but rudy was not in the house no it was much worse he was outside standing just under the he was speaking loud angry words he could fight and there might be murder 
 
 babette opened the window in alarm and called name she told him to go away she did not wish him to remain there 
 you do not wish me to stay cried he then this is an 
 appointment you expected this good friend whom you prefer to me 
 shame on you babette 
 you are detestable exclaimed babette bursting into tears 
 go away i hate you 
 i have not deserved this said rudy as he turned away his 
 cheeks burning and his heart like fire 
 babette threw herself on the bed and wept bitterly so much as i 
 loved thee rudy and yet thou canst think ill of me 
 thus her anger broke forth it relieved her however otherwise 
 she would have been more deeply grieved but now she could sleep 
 soundly as youth only can sleep 
 
 xii evil powers 
 rudy left bex and took his way home along the mountain path 
 the air was fresh but cold for here amidst the deep snow the ice 
 maiden reigned he was so high up that the large trees beneath him 
 with their thick foliage appeared like garden plants and the pines 
 and bushes even less the alpine roses grew near the snow which lay in detached stripes and looked like linen laid out to bleach a 
 blue gentian grew in his path and he crushed it with the butt end 
 of his gun a little higher up he espied two chamois eyes 
 glistened and his thoughts flew at once in a different direction but 
 he was not near enough to take a sure aim he ascended still higher 
 to a spot where a few rough blades of grass grew between the blocks of stone and the chamois passed quietly on over the 
 rudy walked hurriedly while the clouds of mist gathered round him 
 suddenly he found himself on the brink of a precipitous rock the rain was falling in torrents he felt a burning thirst his head was hot 
 and his limbs trembled with cold he seized his but 
 it was empty he had not thought of filling it before ascending the 
 mountain he had never been ill in his life nor ever experienced such 
 sensations as those he now felt he was so tired that he could 
 scarcely resist lying down at his full length to sleep although the 
 ground was flooded with the rain yet when he tried to rouse himself a little every object around him danced and trembled before his eyes 
 suddenly he observed in the doorway of a hut newly built under the 
 rock a young maiden he did not remember having seen this hut before yet there it stood and he thought at first that the young maiden was annette the daughter whom he had once kissed in the dance the maiden was not annette yet it seemed as if he had seen 
 her somewhere before perhaps near grindelwald on the evening of 
 his return home from interlachen after the 
 how did you come here he asked 
 i am at home she replied i am watching my flocks 
 your flocks he exclaimed where do they find pasture there is 
 nothing here but snow and rocks 
 much you know of what grows here she replied laughing not 
 far beneath us there is beautiful my goats go there i 
 tend them carefully i never miss one what is once mine remains 
 mine 
 
 you are bold said rudy 
 and so are you she answered 
 have you any milk in the house he asked if so give me some 
 to drink my thirst is intolerable 
 i have something better than milk she replied which i will 
 give you some travellers who were here yesterday with their guide 
 left behind them a half a flask of wine such as you have never 
 tasted they will not come back to fetch it i know and i shall not 
 drink it so you shall have it 
 
 then the maiden went to fetch the wine poured some into a 
 wooden cup and offered it to rudy 
 
 how good it is said he i have never before tasted such 
 warm invigorating wine and his eyes sparkled with new life a 
 glow diffused itself over his frame it seemed as if every sorrow 
 every oppression were banished from his mind and a fresh free nature were stirring within him you are surely annette the 
 daughter cried he will you give me a kiss 
 yes if you will give me that beautiful ring which you wear on 
 your finger 
 my betrothal ring he replied 
 yes just so said the maiden as she poured out some more wine 
 and held it to his lips again he drank and a living joy streamed 
 through every vein 
 the whole world is mine why therefore should i grieve 
 thought he everything is created for our enjoyment and happiness 
 the stream of life is a stream of happiness let us flow on with it to 
 joy and felicity 
 
 rudy gazed on the young maiden it was annette and yet it was not 
 annette still less did he suppose it was the spectral phantom whom 
 he had met near grindelwald the maiden up here on the mountain was fresh as the new fallen snow blooming as an alpine rose and as 
 as a young kid still she was one of race 
 like rudy he flung his arms round the beautiful being and gazed into 
 her wonderfully clear eyes only for a moment but in that moment 
 words cannot express the effect of his gaze was it the spirit of life 
 or of death that overpowered him was he rising higher or sinking 
 lower and lower into the deep deadly abyss he knew not but the 
 walls of ice shone like glass innumerable clefts yawned 
 around him and the tinkled like the chiming of church 
 bells and shone clearly as pearls in the light of a 
 flame the ice maiden for she it was kissed him and her kiss sent a 
 chill as of ice through his whole frame a cry of agony escaped from 
 him he struggled to get free and tottered from her for a moment all 
 was dark before his eyes but when he opened them again it was 
 light and the alpine maiden had vanished the powers of evil had 
 played their game the sheltering hut was no more to be seen the 
 water trickled down the naked sides of the rocks and snow lay thickly all around rudy shivered with cold he was wet through to the skin and his ring was gone the betrothal ring that babette had given him 
 
 his gun lay near him in the snow he took it up and tried to discharge 
 it but it missed fire heavy clouds lay on the mountain clefts 
 like firm masses of snow upon one of these vertigo sat lurking after 
 his powerless prey and from beneath came a sound as if a piece of 
 rock had fallen from the cleft and was crushing everything that stood 
 in its way or opposed its course 
 
 but at the babette sat alone and wept rudy had not 
 been to see her for six days he who was in the wrong and who ought to ask her forgiveness for did she not love him with her whole heart 
 
 xiii at the mill 
 what strange creatures human beings are said the 
 to the babette and rudy have fallen out with each other 
 she sits and cries and he thinks no more about her 
 that does not please me to hear said the 
 nor me either replied the but i do not take it 
 to heart babette may fall in love with the red whiskers if she 
 likes but he has not been here since he tried to get on the roof 
 the powers of evil carry on their game both around us and within 
 us rudy knew this and thought a great deal about it what was it 
 that had happened to him on the mountain was it really a ghostly 
 apparition or a fever dream rudy knew nothing of fever or any other ailment but while he judged babette he began to examine his own conduct he had allowed wild thoughts to chase each other in his heart and a fierce tornado to break loose could he confess to 
 babette indeed every thought which in the hour of temptation might 
 have led him to wrong doing he had lost her ring and that very 
 loss had won him back to her could she expect him to confess he felt as if his heart would break while he thought of it and while so 
 many memories lingered on his mind he saw her again as she once 
 stood before him a laughing spirited child many loving words which she had spoken to him out of the fulness of her love came like a ray of sunshine into his heart and soon it was all sunshine as he 
 thought of babette but she must also confess she was wrong that 
 she should do 
 
 he went to the mill he went to confession it began with a 
 kiss and ended with rudy being considered the offender it was such a great fault to doubt truth it was most abominable of him 
 such mistrust such violence would cause them both great unhappiness 
 
 this certainly was very true she knew that and therefore babette 
 preached him a little sermon with which she was herself much 
 amused and during the preaching of which she looked quite lovely 
 she acknowledged however that on one point rudy was right her 
 nephew was a fop she intended to burn the book which he had given her so that not the slightest thing should remain to remind her of him 
 well that quarrel is all over said the rudy is 
 come back and they are friends again which they say is the 
 greatest of all pleasures 
 i heard the rats say one night said the that 
 the greatest pleasure in the world was to eat tallow candles and to 
 feast on rancid bacon which are we to believe the rats or the 
 lovers 
 neither of them said the it is always the safest 
 plan to believe nothing you hear 
 
 the greatest happiness was coming for rudy and babette the 
 happy day as it is called that is their was near at 
 hand they were not to be married at the church at bex nor at the 
 house godmother wished the nuptials to be 
 solemnized at montreux in the pretty little church in that town 
 
 the miller was very anxious that this arrangement should be agreed to 
 
 he alone knew what the couple would receive from 
 godmother and he knew also that it was a wedding present 
 well worth a concession the day was fixed and they were to travel as far as villeneuve the evening before to be in time for the steamer 
 which sailed in the morning for montreux and the 
 daughters were to dress and adorn the bride 
 
 here in this house there ought to be a kept said 
 the or else i would not give a mew for the whole affair 
 there is going to be great feasting replied the 
 ducks and pigeons have been killed and a whole roebuck hangs on 
 the wall it makes me lick my lips when i think of it 
 morning they will begin the journey 
 yes and this evening for the last time rudy and 
 babette sat in the house as an engaged couple outside the 
 alps glowed in the evening sunset the evening bells chimed and the 
 children of the sunbeam sang whatever happens is best 
 
 xiv night visions 
 the sun had gone down and the clouds lay low on the valley of the 
 rhone the wind blew from the south across the mountains it was an 
 african wind a wind which scattered the clouds for a moment and then suddenly fell the broken clouds hung in fantastic forms upon the hills by the rapid rhone they assumed the shapes of antediluvian animals of eagles hovering in the air of frogs 
 leaping over a marsh and then sunk down upon the rushing stream and appeared to sail upon it although floating in the air an uprooted 
 was being carried away by the current and marking out its 
 path by eddying circles on the water vertigo and his sisters were 
 dancing upon it and raising these circles on the foaming river the 
 moon lighted up the snow on the shone on the dark 
 woods and on the drifting clouds those fantastic forms which at night might be taken for spirits of the powers of nature the 
 saw them through the panes of his little window 
 they sailed in hosts before the ice maiden as she came out of her palace of ice then she seated herself on the trunk of the as on a broken skiff and the water from the glaciers carried her down the 
 river to the open lake 
 
 the wedding guests are coming sounded from air and sea these 
 were the sights and sounds without within there were visions for 
 babette had a wonderful dream she dreamt that she had been married to rudy for many years and that one day when he was out chamois hunting and she alone in their dwelling at home the young englishman 
 with the golden whiskers sat with her his eyes were quite eloquent 
 and his words possessed a magic power he offered her his hand and 
 she was obliged to follow him they went out of the house and 
 stepped downwards always downwards and it seemed to babette as if she had a weight on her heart which continually grew heavier she felt she was committing a sin against rudy a sin against god 
 suddenly she found herself forsaken her clothes torn by the thorns and her hair gray she looked upwards in her agony and there on the edge of the rock she espied rudy she stretched out her arms to him but she did not venture to call him or to pray and had she called him it would have been useless for it was not rudy only his hunting coat and hat hanging on an alpenstock as the hunters sometimes arrange them to deceive the chamois oh she exclaimed in her agony oh that i had died on the happiest day of my life my o my god it would have been a mercy and a blessing had rudy travelled far away from me and i had never known him none know what will happen in the future and then in ungodly despair she cast herself down into the deep rocky gulf the spell was broken a cry of terror escaped her and she awoke 
 the dream was over it had vanished but she knew she had dreamt 
 something frightful about the young englishman yet months had 
 passed since she had seen him or even thought of him was he still 
 at montreux and should she meet him there on her wedding day a 
 slight shadow passed over her pretty mouth as she thought of this and she knit her brows but the smile soon returned to her lip and joy 
 sparkled in her eyes for this was the morning of the day on which she 
 and rudy were to be married and the sun was shining brightly rudy 
 was already in the parlor when she entered it and they very soon 
 started for villeneuve both of them were overflowing with 
 happiness and the miller was in the best of tempers laughing and 
 merry he was a good honest soul and a kind father 
 now we are masters of the house said the 
 
 xv the conclusion 
 it was early in the afternoon and just at when the 
 three joyous travellers reached villeneuve after dinner the miller 
 placed himself in the smoked his pipe and had a little 
 nap the bridal pair went out through the town and along 
 the high road at the foot of the rocks and by the deep blue lake 
 
 the gray walls and the heavy towers of the 
 gloomy castle of chillon were reflected in the clear flood the 
 little island on which grew the three acacias lay at a short 
 distance looking like a bouquet rising from the lake how delightful 
 it must be to live there said babette who again felt the greatest 
 wish to visit the island and an opportunity offered to gratify her 
 wish at once for on the shore lay a boat and the rope by which it 
 was moored could be very easily loosened they saw no one near so 
 they took possession of it without asking permission of any one and 
 rudy could row very well the oars divided the pliant water like the 
 fins of a fish that water which with all its yielding softness is 
 so strong to bear and to carry so mild and smiling when at rest 
 and yet so terrible in its destroying power a white streak of foam 
 followed in the wake of the boat which in a few minutes carried 
 them both to the little island where they went on shore but there 
 was only just room enough for two to dance rudy swung babette round two or three times and then they sat down on a 
 little bench under the drooping and looked into each 
 eyes while everything around them glowed in the rays of the 
 setting sun 
 
 the forests on the mountains were covered with a purple 
 hue like the heather bloom and where the woods terminated and the 
 rocks became prominent they looked almost transparent in the rich 
 crimson glow of the evening sky the surface of the lake was like a 
 bed of pink 
 
 as the evening advanced the shadows fell upon the 
 mountains of savoy painting them in colors of deep blue while their 
 topmost peaks glowed like red lava and for a moment this light was 
 reflected on the cultivated parts of the mountains making them appear as if newly risen from the lap of earth and giving to the 
 peak of the dent du midi the appearance of the full 
 moon as it rises above the horizon 
 
 rudy and babette felt that they had never seen the alpine glow 
 in such perfection before how very beautiful it is and what 
 happiness to be here exclaimed babette 
 
 earth has nothing more to bestow upon me said rudy an evening 
 like this is worth a whole life often have i realized my good 
 fortune but never more than in this moment i feel that if my 
 existence were to end now i should still have lived a happy life 
 what a glorious world this is one day ends and another begins even 
 more beautiful than the last how infinitely good god is babette 
 i have such complete happiness in my heart said she 
 earth has no more to bestow answered rudy and then came the 
 sound of the evening bells borne upon the breeze over the mountains 
 of switzerland and savoy while still in the golden splendor of the 
 west stood the dark blue mountains of jura 
 god grant you all that is brightest and best exclaimed babette 
 he will said rudy he will you will be 
 wholly mine my own sweet wife 
 the boat cried babette suddenly the boat in which they were 
 to return had broken loose and was floating away from the island 
 i will fetch it back said rudy throwing off his coat and 
 boots he sprang into the lake and swam with strong efforts towards 
 it 
 
 the water from the glaciers of the mountains was icy 
 cold and very deep rudy gave but one glance into the water beneath 
 but in that one glance he saw a gold ring rolling glittering and 
 sparkling before him his engaged ring came into his mind but this 
 was larger and spread into a glittering circle in which appeared a 
 clear glacier deep chasms yawned around it the glittered as if lighted with blue flame and tinkled like the chiming of 
 church bells in one moment he saw what would require many words to describe young hunters and young maidens men and women who had sunk in the deep chasms of the glaciers stood before him here in lifelike forms with eyes open and smiles on their lips and far 
 beneath them could be heard the chiming of the church bells of 
 buried villages where the villagers knelt beneath the vaulted 
 arches of churches in which formed the organ pipes and the mountain stream the music 
 
 on the clear transparent ground sat the ice maiden she raised 
 herself towards rudy and kissed his feet and instantly a cold 
 deathly chill like an electric shock passed through his limbs ice 
 or fire it was impossible to tell the shock was so instantaneous 
 mine mine sounded around him and within him i kissed thee 
 when thou wert a little child i once kissed thee on the mouth and 
 now i have kissed thee from heel to toe thou art wholly mine and 
 then he disappeared in the clear blue water 
 
 all was still the church bells were silent the last tone floated 
 away with the last red glimmer on the evening clouds thou art mine sounded from the depths below but from the heights above from the eternal world also sounded the words thou art mine happy was he thus to pass from life to life from earth to heaven a chord was loosened and tones of sorrow burst forth the icy kiss of death had overcome the perishable body it was but the prelude before real drama could begin the discord which was quickly lost in harmony 
 
 do you think this a sad story poor babette for her it was 
 unspeakable anguish 
 
 the boat drifted farther and farther away no one on the 
 opposite shore knew that the betrothed pair had gone over to the 
 little island the clouds sunk as the evening drew on and it became 
 dark alone in despair she waited and trembled the weather became fearful flash after flash lighted up the mountains of jura savoy and switzerland while peals of thunder that lasted for many minutes rolled over her head the lightning was so vivid that every single vine stem could be seen for a moment as distinctly as in the 
 sunlight at and then all was veiled in darkness it 
 flashed across the lake in winding zigzag lines lighting it up on 
 all sides while the echoes of the thunder grew louder and stronger 
 on land the boats were all carefully drawn up on the beach every 
 living thing sought shelter and at length the rain poured down in 
 torrents 
 
 where can rudy and babette be in this awful weather said the 
 miller 
 
 poor babette sat with her hands clasped and her head bowed 
 down dumb with grief she had ceased to weep and cry for help 
 in the deep water she said to herself far down he lies as if 
 beneath a glacier 
 
 deep in her heart rested the memory of what rudy had told her of 
 the death of his mother and of his own recovery even after he had 
 been taken up as dead from the cleft in the glacier 
 
 ah she thought the ice maiden has him at last 
 suddenly there came a flash of lightning as dazzling as the 
 rays of the sun on the white snow the lake rose for a moment like a 
 shining glacier and before babette stood the pallid glittering 
 majestic form of the ice maiden and at her feet lay corpse 
 mine she cried and again all was darkness around the heaving 
 water 
 
 how cruel murmured babette why should he die just as the 
 day of happiness drew near merciful god enlighten my 
 understanding shed light upon my heart for i cannot comprehend the 
 arrangements of thy providence even while i bow to the decree of 
 thy almighty wisdom and power and god did enlighten her heart 
 
 a sudden flash of thought like a ray of mercy recalled her dream 
 of the preceding night all was vividly represented before her she 
 remembered the words and wishes she had then expressed that what 
 was best for her and for rudy she might piously submit to 
 woe is me she said was the germ of sin really in my heart 
 was my dream a glimpse into the course of my future life whose thread must be violently broken to rescue me from sin oh miserable creature that i am 
 
 thus she sat lamenting in the dark night while through the deep 
 stillness the last words of rudy seemed to ring in her ears this 
 earth has nothing more to bestow words uttered in the fulness of 
 joy were again heard amid the depths of sorrow 
 
 years have passed since this sad event happened the shores of the 
 peaceful lake still smile in beauty the vines are full of luscious 
 grapes steamboats with waving flags pass swiftly by 
 
 with their swelling sails skim lightly over the 
 watery mirror like white butterflies the railway is opened beyond 
 chillon and goes far into the deep valley of the rhone at every 
 station strangers alight with in their hands in 
 which they read of every place worth seeing they visit chillon and 
 observe on the lake the little island with the three acacias and then 
 read in their the story of the bridal pair who in the year 
 rowed over to it they read that the two were missing till the 
 next morning when some people on the shore heard the despairing cries of the bride and went to her assistance and by her were told of 
 the fate 
 
 but the does not speak of quiet life 
 afterwards with her father not at the mill strangers dwell there 
 now but in a pretty house in a row near the station on many an 
 evening she sits at her window and looks out over the 
 to the mountains on which rudy once roamed 
 
 she looks at the alpine glow in the evening sky which is caused by 
 the children of the sun retiring to rest on the and 
 again they breathe their song of the traveller whom the whirlwind 
 could deprive of his cloak but not of his life there is a rosy tint 
 on the mountain snow and there are rosy gleams in each heart in which dwells the thought god permits nothing to happen which is not the best for us but this is not often revealed to all as it was 
 revealed to babette in her wonderful dream

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the ice maiden 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we will pay a visit to switzerland and wander through that 
 country of mountains whose steep and rocky sides are overgrown with forest trees let us climb to the dazzling at their 
 summits and descend again to the green meadows beneath through which rivers and brooks rush along as if they could not quickly enough reach the sea and vanish fiercely shines the sun over those deep valleys as well as upon the heavy masses of snow which lie on the mountains 
 
 during the year these accumulations thaw or fall in the rolling 
 avalance or are piled up in shining glaciers two of these glaciers 
 lie in the broad rocky cliffs between the schreckhorn and the 
 wetterhorn near the little town of grindelwald they are wonderful to 
 behold and therefore in the summer time strangers come here from 
 all parts of the world to see them they cross mountains and travel through the deep valleys or ascend for hours higher and still higher the valleys appearing to sink lower and lower as they proceed and become as small as if seen from an air balloon 
 over the lofty summits of these mountains the clouds often hang like a dark veil while beneath in the valley where many brown wooden houses are scattered about the bright rays of the sun may be shining upon a little brilliant patch of green making it appear almost 
 transparent the waters foam and dash along in the valleys beneath 
 the streams from above trickle and murmur as they fall down the 
 rocky side looking like glittering silver bands 
 
 on both sides of the stand these little wooden 
 houses and as within there are many children and many mouths to 
 feed each house has its own little potato garden these children rush 
 out in swarms and surround travellers whether on foot or in 
 carriages they are all clever at making a bargain they offer for 
 sale the sweetest little models of the mountain cottages 
 in switzerland whether it be rain or sunshine these crowds of 
 children are always to be seen with their wares 
 
 about twenty years ago there might be seen occasionally standing 
 at a short distance from the other children a little boy who was 
 also anxious to sell his curious wares he had an earnest 
 expressive countenance and held the box containing his carved toys 
 tightly with both hands as if unwilling to part with it his 
 earnest look and being also a very little boy made him noticed by 
 the strangers so that he often sold the most without knowing why 
 an walk farther up the ascent lived his grandfather who cut and carved the pretty little and in the old room stood a large press full of all sorts of carved things 
 knives and forks boxes with beautifully carved foliage leaping 
 chamois it contained everything that could delight the eyes of a 
 child but the boy who was named rudy looked with still greater 
 pleasure and longing at some old which hung upon the 
 rafters under the ceiling of the room his grandfather promised him 
 that he should have them some day but that he must first grow big and strong and learn how to use them small as he was the goats were placed in his care and a good should also be a good climber and such rudy was he sometimes indeed climbed higher than the goats for he was fond of seeking for at the top of high trees he was bold and daring but was seldom seen to smile excepting when he stood by the roaring cataract or heard the 
 descending roll of the avalanche he never played with the other 
 children and was not seen with them unless his grandfather sent 
 him down to sell his curious workmanship rudy did not much like 
 trade he loved to climb the mountains or to sit by his grandfather 
 and listen to his tales of olden times or of the people in meyringen 
 the place of his birth 
 
 in the early ages of the world said the old man these people could not be found in switzerland they are a colony from the 
 north where their ancestors still dwell and are called swedes 
 this was something for rudy to know but he learnt more from other 
 sources particularly from the domestic animals who belonged to the 
 house one was a large dog called ajola which had belonged to his 
 father and the other was a this cat stood very high in 
 favor for he had taught him to climb 
 
 come out on the roof with me said the cat and rudy quite 
 understood him for the language of fowls ducks cats and dogs is 
 as easily understood by a young child as his own native tongue but it 
 must be at the age when stick becomes a neighing 
 horse with head legs and tail some children retain these ideas 
 later than others and they are considered backwards and childish 
 for their age people say so but is it so 
 
 come out on the roof with me little rudy was the first thing 
 he heard the cat say and rudy understood him what people say 
 about falling down is all nonsense continued the cat you will 
 not fall unless you are afraid come now set one foot here and 
 another there and feel your way with your keep your eyes 
 wide open and move softly and if you come to a hole jump over it 
 and cling fast as i do and this was just what rudy did he was often on the sloping roof with the cat or on the tops of high trees but more frequently higher still on the ridges of the rocks where puss never came 
 
 higher higher cried the trees and the bushes see to what 
 height we have grown and how fast we hold even to the narrow edges of the rocks 
 
 rudy often reached the top of the mountain before the sunrise and 
 there inhaled his morning draught of the fresh invigorating 
 mountain air own gift which men call the sweet fragrance of 
 plant and herb on the and the mint and wild thyme in 
 the valleys the overhanging clouds absorb all heaviness from the air 
 and the winds convey them away over the summits the 
 spirit of fragrance light and fresh remained behind and this was 
 morning draught the sunbeams those 
 daughters of the sun kissed his cheeks vertigo might be lurking on 
 the watch but he dared not approach him the swallows who had not less than seven nests in his house flew up to him and his goats singing we and you you and we they brought him 
 greetings from his house even from two hens the only 
 birds of the household but rudy was not intimate with them 
 
 although so young and such a little fellow rudy had travelled a 
 great deal he was born in the canton of valais and brought to his 
 grandfather over the mountains he had walked to staubbach a little 
 town that seems to flutter in the air like a silver veil the 
 glittering mountain jungfrau he had also been to the great 
 glaciers but this is connected with a sad story for here his 
 mother met her death and his grandfather used to say that all 
 childish merriment was lost from that time his mother had 
 written in a letter that before he was a year old he had laughed more 
 than he cried but after his fall into the crevasse 
 his disposition had completely changed the grandfather seldom spoke of this but the fact was generally known father had been a postilion and the large dog which now lived in his cottage had always followed him on his journeys over the simplon to the lake of geneva relations on his side lived in the canton of valais in the valley of the rhone his uncle was a chamois hunter and a guide rudy was only a year old when his father died and his mother was anxious to return with her child to her own relations who lived in the bernese oberland her father dwelt at a few hours distance from grindelwald he was a carver in wood and gained so much by it that he had plenty to live upon she set out homewards in the month of june carrying her infant in her arms and accompanied by two chamois hunters crossed the gemmi on her way to grindelwald they had already left more than half the journey behind them they had crossed high ridges and traversed they could even see her native valley with its familiar wooden cottages they had only one more glacier to climb 
 
 some newly fallen snow concealed a cleft which though it did not 
 extend to the foaming waters in the depths beneath was still much 
 deeper than the height of a man the young woman with the child in 
 her arms slipped upon it sank in and disappeared not a shriek not 
 a groan was heard nothing but the whining of a little child more 
 than an hour elapsed before her two companions could obtain from the nearest house ropes and poles to assist in raising them and it was 
 with much exertion that they at last succeeded in raising from the 
 crevasse what appeared to be two dead bodies every means was used to restore them to life with the child they were successful but 
 not with the mother so the old grandfather received his 
 little son into his house an orphan a little boy who laughed more 
 than he cried but it seemed as if laughter had left him in the cold 
 into which he had fallen where as the swiss peasants 
 say the souls of the lost are confined till the 
 
 the glaciers appear as if a rushing stream had been frozen in 
 its course and pressed into blocks of green crystal which 
 balanced one upon another form a wondrous palace of crystal for the ice maiden the queen of the glaciers it is she whose mighty power can crush the traveller to death and arrest the flowing river in 
 its course she is also a child of the air and with the swiftness 
 of the chamois she can reach the mountain tops where the boldest mountaineer has to cut footsteps in the ice to ascend she 
 will sail on a frail over the raging torrents beneath and 
 spring lightly from one iceberg to another with her long 
 hair flowing around her and her robe glittering 
 like the waters of the deep swiss lakes mine is the power to seize 
 and crush she cried once a beautiful boy was stolen from me by 
 man a boy whom i had kissed but had not kissed to death he is 
 again among mankind and tends the goats on the mountains he is 
 always climbing higher and higher far away from all others but not 
 from me he is mine i will send for him and she gave vertigo the 
 commission 
 
 it was summer and the ice maiden was melting amidst the green 
 verdure when vertigo swung himself up and down vertigo has many 
 brothers quite a troop of them and the ice maiden chose the 
 strongest among them they exercise their power in different ways and everywhere some sit on the banisters of steep stairs others on the outer rails of lofty towers or spring like squirrels along the ridges 
 of the mountains others tread the air as a swimmer treads the 
 water and lure their victims here and there till they fall into the 
 deep abyss vertigo and the ice maiden clutch at human beings as 
 the polypus seizes upon all that comes within its reach and now 
 vertigo was to seize rudy 
 
 seize him indeed cried vertigo i cannot do it that 
 monster of a cat has taught him her tricks that child of the human 
 race has a power within him which keeps me at a distance i cannot 
 possibly reach the boy when he hangs from the branches of trees 
 over the precipice or i would gladly tickle his feet and send him 
 heels over head through the air but i cannot accomplish it 
 
 we must accomplish it said the ice maiden either you or i 
 must and i will i will 
 
 no no sounded through the air like an echo on the mountain 
 church bells chime it was an answer in song in the melting tones 
 of a chorus from others of spirits good and loving 
 spirits the daughters of the sunbeam they who place themselves in 
 a circle every evening on the mountain peaks there they spread out 
 their wings which as the sun sinks become more flaming red until the lofty alps seem to burn with fire men call this the alpine glow after the sun has set they disappear within the white 
 snow on the and slumber there till sunrise when they 
 again come forth they have great love for flowers for butterflies 
 and for mankind and from among the latter they had chosen little 
 rudy you shall not catch him you shall not seize him they sang 
 greater and stronger than he have i seized said the ice maiden 
 then the daughters of the sun sang a song of the traveller 
 whose cloak had been carried away by the wind the wind took the 
 covering but not the man it could even seize upon him but not 
 hold him fast the children of strength are more powerful more 
 ethereal even than we are they can rise higher than our parent 
 the sun they have the magic words that rule the wind and the waves 
 and compel them to serve and obey and they can at last cast off the 
 heavy oppressive weight of mortality and soar upwards thus sweetly sounded the tones of the chorus 
 
 and each morning the rays shone through the one little 
 window of the house upon the quiet child the 
 daughters of the sunbeam kissed him they wished to thaw and melt 
 and obliterate the ice kiss which the queenly maiden of the glaciers 
 had given him as he lay in the lap of his dead mother in the deep 
 crevasse of ice from which he had been so wonderfully rescued 
 
 ii the journey to the new home 
 rudy was just eight years old when his uncle who lived on the 
 other side of the mountain wished to have the boy as he thought he 
 might obtain a better education with him and learn something more 
 his grandfather thought the same so he consented to let him go 
 rudy had many to say farewell to as well as his grandfather first 
 there was ajola the old dog 
 
 your father was the postilion and i was the dog 
 said ajola we have often travelled the same journey together i knew all the dogs and men on this side of the mountain it is not my 
 habit to talk much but now that we have so little time to converse 
 together i will say something more than usual i will relate to you a 
 story which i have reflected upon for a long time i do not 
 understand it and very likely you will not but that is of no 
 consequence i have however learnt from it that in this world things 
 are not equally divided neither for dogs nor for men all are not 
 born to lie on the lap and to drink milk i have never been petted 
 in this way but i have seen a little dog seated in the place of a 
 gentleman or lady and travelling inside a the lady 
 who was his mistress or of whom he was master carried a bottle of 
 milk of which the little dog now and then drank she also offered him 
 pieces of sugar to crunch he sniffed at them proudly but would not 
 eat one so she ate them herself i was running along the dirty road 
 by the side of the carriage as hungry as a dog could be chewing the 
 cud of my own thoughts which were rather in confusion but many other things seemed in confusion also why was not i lying on a lap and travelling in a coach i could not tell yet i knew i could not 
 alter my own condition either by barking or growling 
 
 this was farewell speech and rudy threw his arms round 
 the neck and kissed his cold nose then he took the cat in his 
 arms but he struggled to get free 
 
 you are getting too strong for me he said but i will not 
 use my claws against you clamber away over the mountains it was i 
 who taught you to climb do not fancy you are going to fall and you 
 will be quite safe then the cat jumped down and ran away he did not wish rudy to see that there were tears in his eyes 
 
 the hens were hopping about the floor one of them had no tail 
 a traveller who fancied himself a sportsman had shot off her tail 
 he had mistaken her for a bird of prey 
 
 rudy is going away over the mountains said one of the hens 
 he is always in such a hurry said the other and i 
 like taking leave so they both hopped out 
 
 but the goats said farewell they bleated and wanted to go with 
 him they were so very sorry 
 
 just at this time two clever guides were going to cross the 
 mountains to the other side of the gemmi and rudy was to go with them on foot it was a long walk for such a little boy but he had plenty of strength and invincible courage the swallows flew with him a little way singing we and you you and we the way led across 
 the rushing lutschine which falls in numerous streams from the dark 
 clefts of the grindelwald glaciers trunks of fallen trees and 
 blocks of stone form bridges over these streams after passing a 
 forest of alders they began to ascend passing by some blocks of 
 ice that had loosened themselves from the side of the mountain and lay across their path they had to step over these or walk 
 round them rudy crept here and ran there his eyes sparkling with 
 joy and he stepped so firmly with his mountain shoe that 
 he left a mark behind him wherever he placed his foot 
 
 the earth was black where the mountain torrents or the melted 
 ice had poured upon it but the bluish green glassy ice sparkled 
 and glittered they had to go round little pools like lakes enclosed 
 between large masses of ice and while thus wandering out of their 
 path they came near an immense stone which lay balanced on the 
 edge of an icy peak the stone lost its balance just as they reached 
 it and rolled over into the abyss beneath while the noise of its 
 fall was echoed back from every hollow cliff of the glaciers 
 
 they were always going upwards the glaciers seemed to spread 
 above them like a continued chain of masses of ice piled up in wild 
 confusion between bare and rugged rocks rudy thought for a moment of what had been told him that he and his mother had once lain buried in one of these cold fissures but he soon banished such thoughts and looked upon the story as fabulous like many other stories which had been told him once or twice when the men thought the way was rather difficult for such a little boy they 
 held out their hands to assist him but he would not accept their 
 assistance for he stood on the slippery ice as firmly as if he had 
 been a chamois they came at length to rocky ground sometimes 
 stepping upon stones sometimes passing beneath stunted and again through green meadows the landscape was always changing but ever above them towered the lofty mountains whose names not only rudy but every other child knew the jungfrau the monk and the eiger 
 
 rudy had never been so far away before he had never trodden on 
 the ocean of snow that lay here with its immovable 
 billows from which the wind blows off the snowflake now and then 
 as it cuts the foam from the waves of the sea the glaciers stand here 
 so close together it might almost be said they are and 
 each is a crystal palace for the ice maiden whose power and will it 
 is to seize and imprison the unwary traveller 
 
 the sun shone warmly and the snow sparkled as if covered with 
 glittering diamonds numerous insects especially butterflies and 
 bees lay dead in heaps on the snow they had ventured too high or 
 the wind had carried them here and left them to die of cold 
 
 around the wetterhorn hung a feathery cloud like a woolbag and a 
 threatening cloud too for as it sunk lower it increased in size 
 and concealed within was a fohn fearful in its violence should it 
 break loose this journey with its varied incidents the wild paths 
 the night passed on the mountain the steep rocky precipices the 
 hollow clefts in which the rustling waters from time immemorial had 
 worn away passages for themselves through blocks of stone all 
 these were firmly impressed on memory 
 
 in a forsaken stone building which stood just beyond the seas 
 of snow they one night took shelter here they found some charcoal 
 and pine branches so that they soon made a fire they arranged 
 couches to lie on as well as they could and then the men seated 
 themselves by the fire took out their pipes and began to smoke 
 they also prepared a warm spiced drink of which they partook and rudy was not forgotten he had his share then they began to talk of those mysterious beings with which the land of the alps abounds the hosts of apparitions which come in the night and carry off the sleepers through the air to the wonderful floating town of venice of the wild who drives the black sheep across the meadows 
 these flocks are never seen yet the tinkle of their little bells has often been heard as well as their unearthly bleating rudy listened eagerly but without fear for he knew not what fear meant and while he 
 listened he fancied he could hear the roaring of the spectral herd 
 it seemed to come nearer and roar louder till the men heard it also 
 and listened in silence till at length they told rudy that he 
 must not dare to sleep it was a fohn that violent which 
 rushes from the mountain to the valley beneath and in its fury 
 snaps asunder the trunks of large trees as if they were but slender 
 reeds and carries the wooden houses from one side of a river to the 
 other as easily as we could move the pieces on a after an hour had passed they told rudy that it was all over and he might 
 go to sleep and fatigued with his long walk he readily slept at the 
 word of command 
 
 very early the following morning they again set out the sun on 
 this day lighted up for rudy new mountains new glaciers and new 
 they had entered the canton valais and found 
 themselves on the ridge of the hills which can be seen from 
 grindelwald but he was still far from his new home they pointed 
 out to him other clefts other meadows other woods and rocky paths and other houses strange men made their appearance before him and what men they were misshapen creatures with yellow complexions and on their necks were dark ugly lumps of flesh hanging down like bags they were called cretins they dragged themselves along painfully and stared at the strangers with vacant eyes the women looked more dreadful than the men poor rudy were these the sort of people he should see at his new home 
 
 iii the uncle 
 rudy arrived at last at his house and was thankful to 
 find the people like those he had been accustomed to see there was 
 only one cretin amongst them a poor idiot boy one of those 
 unfortunate beings who in their neglected conditions go from house 
 to house and are received and taken care of in different families 
 for a month or two at a time 
 
 poor saperli had just arrived at his house when rudy came 
 the uncle was an experienced hunter he also followed the trade of a 
 cooper his wife was a lively little person with a face like a 
 bird eyes like those of an eagle and a long hairy throat 
 everything was new to rudy the fashion of the dress the manners the employments and even the language but the latter his childish ear 
 would soon learn he saw also that there was more wealth here when 
 compared with his former home at his the rooms were 
 larger the walls were adorned with the horns of the chamois and 
 brightly polished guns over the door hung a painting of the virgin 
 mary fresh alpine roses and a burning lamp stood near it 
 uncle was as we have said one of the most noted chamois hunters in 
 the whole district and also one of the best guides rudy soon 
 became the pet of the house but there was another pet an old 
 hound blind and lazy who would never more follow the hunt well as 
 he had once done so but his former good qualities were not forgotten and therefore the animal was kept in the family and treated with every indulgence rudy stroked the old hound but he did not like strangers and rudy was as yet a stranger he did not however long remain so he soon endeared himself to every heart and became like one of the family 
 
 we are not very badly off here in the canton valais said his 
 uncle one day we have the chamois they do not die so fast as the 
 wild goats and it is certainly much better here now than in former 
 times how highly the old times have been spoken of but ours is 
 better the bag has been opened and a current of air now blows 
 through our once confined valley something better always makes its 
 appearance when old things fail 
 
 when his uncle became communicative he would relate stories of 
 his youthful days and farther back still of the warlike times in 
 which his father had lived valais was then as he expressed it 
 only a bag quite full of sick people miserable cretins 
 but the french soldiers came and they were capital doctors they soon killed the disease and the sick people too the french people knew how to fight in more ways than one and the girls knew how to 
 conquer too and when he said this the uncle nodded at his wife who 
 was a french woman by birth and laughed the french could also do battle on the stones it was they who cut a road out of the solid 
 rock over the simplon such a road that i need only say to a child of 
 three years old go down to italy you have only to keep in the 
 high road and the child will soon arrive in italy if he followed my 
 directions 
 
 then the uncle sang a french song and cried hurrah long live 
 napoleon buonaparte this was the first time rudy had ever heard of france or of lyons that great city on the rhone where his uncle 
 had once lived his uncle said that rudy in a very few years would 
 become a clever hunter he had quite a talent for it he taught the 
 boy to hold a gun properly and to load and fire it in the hunting 
 season he took him to the hills and made him drink the warm blood 
 of the chamois which is said to prevent the hunter from becoming 
 giddy he taught him to know the time when from the different 
 mountains the avalanche is likely to fall namely at noontide or 
 in the evening from the effects of the rays he made him 
 observe the movements of the chamois when he gave a leap so that he might fall firmly and lightly on his feet he told him that when on 
 the fissures of the rocks he could find no place for his feet he must 
 support himself on his elbows and cling with his legs and even 
 lean firmly with his back for this could be done when necessary he 
 told him also that the chamois are very cunning they place 
 on the watch but the hunter must be more cunning than 
 they are and find them out by the scent 
 
 one day when rudy went out hunting with his uncle he hung a coat 
 and hat on an alpine staff and the chamois mistook it for a man as 
 they generally do the mountain path was narrow here indeed it was 
 scarcely a path at all only a kind of shelf close to the yawning 
 abyss the snow that lay upon it was partially thawed and the 
 stones crumbled beneath the feet every fragment of stone broken off 
 struck the sides of the rock in its fall till it rolled into the 
 depths beneath and sunk to rest upon this shelf uncle laid 
 himself down and crept forward at about a hundred paces behind him stood rudy upon the highest point of the rock watching a great 
 vulture hovering in the air with a single stroke of his wing the bird 
 might easily cast the creeping hunter into the abyss beneath and make 
 him his prey uncle had eyes for nothing but the chamois 
 who with its young kid had just appeared round the edge of the rock 
 
 so rudy kept his eyes fixed on the bird he knew well what the great 
 creature wanted therefore he stood in readiness to discharge his 
 gun at the proper moment suddenly the chamois made a spring and 
 his uncle fired and struck the animal with the deadly bullet while 
 the young kid rushed away as if for a long life he had been 
 accustomed to danger and practised flight the large bird alarmed 
 at the report of the gun wheeled off in another direction and 
 uncle was saved from danger of which he knew nothing till he was told of it by the boy 
 
 while they were both in pleasant mood wending their way 
 homewards and the uncle whistling the tune of a song he had learnt in 
 his young days they suddenly heard a peculiar sound which seemed to come from the top of the mountain they looked up and saw above them on the rock the heave and lift itself as a piece of linen stretched on the ground to dry raises itself when the wind creeps under it smooth as polished marble slabs the waves of snow cracked and loosened themselves and then suddenly with the rumbling noise of distant thunder fell like a foaming cataract into the abyss an avalanche had fallen not upon rudy and his uncle but very near them alas a great deal too near 
 
 hold fast rudy cried his uncle hold fast with all your 
 might 
 
 then rudy clung with his arms to the trunk of the nearest tree 
 while his uncle climbed above him and held fast by the branches 
 the avalanche rolled past them at some distance but the gust of 
 wind that followed like the of the avalanche snapped 
 asunder the trees and bushes over which it swept as if they had 
 been but dry rushes and threw them about in every direction the tree to which rudy clung was thus overthrown and rudy dashed to the ground the higher branches were snapped off and carried away to a great distance and among these shattered branches lay uncle with his skull fractured when they found him his hand was still warm but it would have been impossible to recognize his face 
 rudy stood by pale and trembling it was the first shock of his life 
 the first time he had ever felt fear late in the evening he 
 returned home with the fatal news to that home which was now to be so full of sorrow his wife uttered not a word nor shed a 
 tear till the corpse was brought in then her agony burst forth 
 
 the poor cretin crept away to his bed and nothing was seen of him 
 during the whole of the following day towards evening however he 
 came to rudy and said will you write a letter for me saperli 
 cannot write saperli can only take the letters to the post 
 
 a letter for you said rudy who do you wish to write to 
 
 to the lord christ he replied 
 
 what do you mean asked rudy 
 
 then the poor idiot as the cretin was often called looked at 
 rudy with a most touching expression in his eyes clasped his hands 
 and said solemnly and devoutly saperli wants to send a letter to 
 jesus christ to pray him to let saperli die and not the master of 
 the house here 
 
 rudy pressed his hand and replied a letter would not reach 
 him up above it would not give him back whom we have lost 
 it was not however easy for rudy to convince saperli of the 
 impossibility of doing what he wished 
 
 now you must work for us said his and rudy 
 very soon became the entire support of the house 
 
 babette 
 iv babette 
 who was the best marksman in the canton valais the chamois knew 
 well save yourselves from rudy they might well say and who is the handsomest marksman oh it is rudy said the maidens but they did not say save yourselves from rudy neither did anxious 
 mothers say so for he bowed to them as pleasantly as to the young 
 girls he was so brave and cheerful his cheeks were brown his 
 teeth white and his eyes dark and sparkling he was now a handsome 
 young man of twenty years the most icy water could not deter him from swimming he could twist and turn like a fish none could climb like he and he clung as firmly to the edges of the rocks as a limpet he had strong muscular power as could be seen when he leapt from rock to rock he had learnt this first from the cat and more lately from the chamois rudy was considered the best guide over the mountains every one had great confidence in him he might have made a great deal of money as guide his uncle had also taught him the trade of a cooper but he had no inclination for either his delight was in which also brought him plenty of money 
 rudy would be a very good match as people said if he would not look above his own station he was also such a famous partner in dancing that the girls often dreamt about him and one and another thought of him even when awake 
 
 he kissed me in the dance said annette the 
 daughter to her dearest friend but she ought not to have told 
 this even to her dearest friend it is not easy to keep such secrets 
 they are like sand in a sieve they slip out it was therefore soon 
 known that rudy so brave and so good as he was had kissed some one while dancing and yet he had never kissed her who was dearest to him 
 
 ah ah said an old hunter he has kissed annette has he he 
 has begun with a and i suppose he will kiss through the whole 
 alphabet 
 
 but a kiss in the dance was all the busy tongues could accuse 
 him of he certainly had kissed annette but she was not the flower of 
 his heart 
 
 down in the valley near bex among the great by the 
 side of a little rushing lived a rich miller his 
 was a large building three storeys high with little 
 turrets the roof was covered with chips bound together with tin 
 plates that glittered in sunshine and in the moonlight the largest 
 of the turrets had a representing an apple pierced by 
 a glittering arrow in memory of william tell the mill was a neat and 
 place that allowed itself to be sketched and written 
 about but the daughter did not permit any to sketch or write 
 about her so at least rudy would have said for her image was 
 pictured in his heart her eyes shone in it so brightly that quite 
 a flame had been kindled there and like all other fires it had 
 burst forth so suddenly that the daughter the beautiful 
 babette was quite unaware of it rudy had never spoken a word to 
 her on the subject the miller was rich and on that account babette 
 stood very high and was rather difficult to aspire to but said 
 rudy to himself nothing is too high for a man to reach he must 
 climb with confidence in himself and he will not fail he had learnt 
 this lesson in his youthful home 
 
 it happened once that rudy had some business to settle at bex 
 it was a long journey at that time for the railway had not been 
 opened from the glaciers of the rhone at the foot of the simplon 
 between its mountain summits stretches the valley of 
 the canton valais through it runs the noble river of the rhone which 
 often overflows its banks covering fields and highways and 
 destroying everything in its course near the towns of sion and st 
 maurice the valley takes a turn and bends like an elbow and 
 behind st maurice becomes so narrow that there is only space enough for the bed of the river and a narrow an old tower stands here as if it were guardian to the canton valais which ends at this point and from it we can look across the stone bridge to 
 the on the other side where the canton vaud commences not far from this spot stands the town of bex and at every step can be seen an increase of fruitfulness and verdure it is like entering a 
 grove of chestnut and here and there the cypress and 
 pomegranate blossoms peep forth and it is almost as warm as an 
 italian climate rudy arrived at bex and soon finished the business 
 which had brought him there and then walked about the town but not even the boy could be seen nor any one belonging to the 
 mill not to mention babette this did not please him at all 
 
 evening came on the air was filled with the perfume of the wild thyme and the blossoms of the and the green woods on the mountains seemed to be covered with a shining veil blue as the sky 
 
 over everything reigned a stillness not of sleep or of death but 
 as if nature were holding her breath that her image might be 
 photographed on the blue vault of heaven here and there amidst the 
 trees of the silent valley stood poles which supported the wires of 
 the electric telegraph against one of these poles leaned an object so 
 motionless that it might have been mistaken for the trunk of a tree 
 but it was rudy standing there as still as at that moment was 
 everything around him he was not asleep neither was he dead but 
 just as the various events in the world matters of momentous 
 importance to individuals were flying through the telegraph wires 
 without the quiver of a wire or the slightest tone so through the 
 mind of rudy thoughts of overwhelming importance were passing 
 without an outward sign of emotion the happiness of his future life 
 depended upon the decision of his present reflections his eyes were 
 fixed on one spot in the distance a light that twinkled through the 
 foliage from the parlor of the house where babette dwelt 
 
 rudy stood so still that it might have been supposed he was 
 watching for a chamois but he was in reality like a chamois who will 
 stand for a moment looking as if it were chiselled out of the rock 
 and then if only a stone rolled by would suddenly bound forward with a spring far away from the hunter and so with rudy a sudden roll of his thoughts roused him from his stillness and made him bound forward with determination to act 
 
 never despair cried he a visit to the mill to say good 
 evening to the miller and good evening to little babette can do no 
 harm no one ever fails who has confidence in himself if i am to be 
 husband i must see her some time or other 
 
 then rudy laughed joyously and took courage to go to the mill he 
 knew what he wanted he wanted to marry babette the clear water of 
 the river rolled over its yellow bed and willows and 
 were reflected in it as rudy stepped along the path to the 
 house but as the children sing 
 there was no one at home in the house 
 only a kitten at play 
 the cat standing on the steps put up its back and cried mew but 
 rudy had no inclination for this sort of conversation he passed on 
 and knocked at the door no one heard him no one opened the door 
 mew said the cat again and had rudy been still a child he would 
 have understood this language and known that the cat wished to tell 
 him there was no one at home so he was obliged to go to the mill 
 and make inquiries and there he heard that the miller had gone on a 
 journey to interlachen and taken babette with him to the great 
 shooting festival which began that morning and would continue for 
 eight days and that people from all the german settlements would be 
 there 
 
 poor rudy we may well say it was not a fortunate day for his 
 visit to bex he had just to return the way he came through st 
 maurice and sion to his home in the valley but he did not despair 
 when the sun rose the next morning his good spirits had returned 
 indeed he had never really lost them babette is at interlachen 
 said rudy to himself many days journey from here it is certainly a 
 long way for any one who takes the but not so far if he 
 takes a short cut across the mountain and that just suits a 
 i have been that way before for it leads to the 
 home of my childhood where as a little boy i lived with my 
 grandfather and there are shooting matches at interlachen i will go 
 and try to stand first in the match babette will be there and i 
 shall be able to make her acquaintance 
 
 carrying his light knapsack which contained his sunday clothes 
 on his back and with his musket and his over his shoulder 
 rudy started to take the shortest way across the mountain still it 
 was a great distance the shooting matches were to commence on that day and to continue for a whole week he had been told also that 
 the miller and babette would remain that time with some relatives at 
 interlachen so over the gemmi rudy climbed bravely and determined to descend the side of the grindelwald bright and joyous were his feelings as he stepped lightly onwards inhaling the invigorating mountain air the valley sunk as he ascended the circle of the horizon expanded one peak after another rose before him till the whole of the glittering alpine range became visible 
 rudy knew each peak and he continued his course towards 
 the schreckhorn with its white powdered stone finger raised high in 
 the air at length he had crossed the highest ridges and before him 
 lay the green pasture lands sloping down towards the valley which was once his home the buoyancy of the air made his heart light hill 
 and valley were blooming in luxuriant beauty and his thoughts were 
 youthful dreams in which old age or death were out of the question 
 life power and enjoyment were in the future and he felt free and 
 light as a bird and the swallows flew round him as in the days of 
 his childhood singing we and you you and we all was overflowing with joy beneath him lay the meadows covered with velvety green with the murmuring river flowing through them and dotted here and there were small wooden houses he could see the edges of the glaciers looking like green glass against the soiled snow and the deep chasms beneath the loftiest glacier the church bells were ringing as if to welcome him to his home with their sweet tones 
 his heart beat quickly and for a moment he seemed to have 
 foregotten babette so full were his thoughts of old recollections he 
 was in imagination once more wandering on the road where when a 
 little boy he with other children came to sell their curiously 
 carved toy houses yonder behind the still stood his 
 house his father but strangers dwelt in it 
 now children came running to him as he had once done and wished 
 to sell their wares one of them offered him an alpine rose rudy took the rose as a good omen and thought of babette he quickly crossed the bridge where the two rivers flow into each other here he found a walk with large and their thick 
 foliage formed a pleasant shade very soon he perceived in the 
 distance waving flags on which glittered a white cross on a red 
 ground the standard of the danes as well as of the swiss and 
 before him lay interlachen 
 
 it is really a splendid town like none other that i have ever 
 seen said rudy to himself it was indeed a swiss town in its holiday 
 dress not like the many other towns crowded with heavy stone houses stiff and foreign looking no here it seemed as if the wooden 
 houses on the hills had run into the valley and placed themselves 
 in rows and ranks by the side of the clear river which rushes like an 
 arrow in its course the streets were rather irregular it is true 
 but still this added to their picturesque appearance there was one 
 street which rudy thought the prettiest of them all it had been built 
 since he had visited the town when a little boy it seemed to him as 
 if all the neatest and most curiously carved toy houses which his 
 grandfather once kept in the large cupboard at home had been 
 brought out and placed in this spot and that they had increased in 
 size since then as the old chestnut trees had done the houses were 
 called hotels the woodwork on the windows and balconies was curiously carved the roofs were gayly painted and before each house was a flower garden which separated it from the macadamized 
 
 these houses all stood on the same side of the road so that the 
 fresh green meadows in which were cows grazing with bells on 
 their necks were not hidden the sound of these bells is often 
 heard amidst alpine scenery these meadows were encircled by lofty 
 hills which receded a little in the centre so that the most 
 beautifully formed of swiss mountains the jungfrau 
 could be distinctly seen glittering in the distance a number of 
 elegantly dressed gentlemen and ladies from foreign lands and 
 crowds of country people from the neighboring cantons were 
 assembled in the town each marksman wore the number of hits he had made twisted in a garland round his hat here were music and singing of all descriptions trumpets shouting and noise the houses and bridges were adorned with verses and inscriptions flags and banners were waving shot after shot was fired which was the best music to ears and amidst all this excitement he quite forgot babette on whose account only he had come the shooters were thronging round the target and rudy was soon amongst them but when he took his turn to fire he proved himself the best shot for he always struck the 
 who may that young stranger be was the inquiry on all sides 
 he speaks french as it is spoken in the swiss cantons 
 and makes himself understood very well when he speaks german 
 said some 
 he lived here when a child with his grandfather in a house 
 on the road to grindelwald remarked one of the sportsmen 
 and full of life was this young stranger his eyes sparkled his 
 glance was steady and his arm sure therefore he always hit the mark 
 good fortune gives courage and rudy was always courageous he soon had a circle of friends gathered round him every one noticed him and did him homage babette had quite vanished from his thoughts when he was struck on the shoulder by a heavy hand and a deep voice said to him in french you are from the canton valais 
 rudy turned round and beheld a man with a ruddy pleasant face 
 and a stout figure it was the rich miller from bex his broad portly 
 person hid the slender lovely babette but she came forward and 
 glanced at him with her bright dark eyes the rich miller was very 
 much flattered at the thought that the young man who was acknowledged to be the best shot and was so praised by every one should be from his own canton now was rudy really fortunate he had travelled all this way to this place and those he had forgotten were now come to seek him when country people go far from home they often meet with those they know and improve their acquaintance rudy by his shooting had gained the first place in the just as the miller at home at bex stood first because of his money and his mill so the two men shook hands which they had never done before 
 
 babette too held out her hand to rudy frankly and he pressed it 
 in his and looked at her so earnestly that she blushed deeply the 
 miller talked of the long journey they had travelled and of the 
 many towns they had seen it was his opinion that he had really made 
 as great a journey as if he had travelled in a steamship a railway 
 carriage or a 
 
 i came by a much shorter way said rudy i came over the 
 mountains there is no road so high that a man may not venture upon 
 it 
 
 ah yes and break your neck said the miller and you look 
 like one who will break his neck some day you are so daring 
 oh nothing ever happens to a man if he has confidence in 
 himself replied rudy 
 
 the relations at interlachen with whom the miller and 
 babette were staying invited rudy to visit them when they found he 
 came from the same canton as the miller it was a most pleasant visit 
 good fortune seemed to follow him as it does those who think and 
 act for themselves and who remember the proverb nuts are given to us but they are not cracked for us and rudy was treated by the 
 relations almost like one of the family and glasses of 
 wine were poured out to drink to the welfare of the best shooter 
 babette clinked glasses with rudy and he returned thanks for the 
 toast in the evening they all took a delightful walk under the 
 in front of the stately hotels there were so many 
 people and such crowding that rudy was obliged to offer his arm to 
 babette then he told her how happy it made him to meet people from the canton vaud for vaud and valais were neighboring cantons he spoke of this pleasure so heartily that babette could not resist giving his arm a slight squeeze and so they walked on together and talked and chatted like old acquaintances rudy felt inclined to laugh sometimes at the absurd dress and walk of the foreign ladies but babette did not wish to make fun of them for she knew there must be some good excellent people amongst them she herself had a godmother who was a english lady eighteen years before when babette was christened this lady was staying at bex and she stood godmother for her and gave her the valuable brooch she now wore in her bosom 
 
 her godmother had twice written to her and this year she was 
 expected to visit interlachen with her two daughters but they are 
 added babette who was only eighteen they are nearly 
 thirty her sweet little mouth was never still a moment and all that 
 she said sounded in ears as matters of the greatest importance and at last he told her what he was longing to tell how often he had been at bex how well he knew the mill and how often he had seen babette when most likely she had not noticed him and lastly that full of many thoughts which he could not tell her he had been to the mill on the evening when she and her father has started on their long journey but not too far for him to find a way to overtake 
 them he told her all this and a great deal more he told her how 
 much he could endure for her and that it was to see her and not 
 the which had brought him to interlachen babette 
 became quite silent after hearing all this it was almost too much 
 and it troubled her 
 
 and while they thus wandered on the sun sunk behind the lofty 
 mountains the jungfrau stood out in brightness and splendor as a 
 to the green woods of the surrounding hills every one 
 stood still to look at the beautiful sight rudy and babette among 
 them 
 
 nothing can be more beautiful than this said babette 
 nothing replied rudy looking at babette 
 i must return home remarked rudy a few minutes 
 afterwards 
 
 come and visit us at bex whispered babette my father will 
 be pleased to see you 
 
 v on the way home 
 oh what a number of things rudy had to carry over the 
 mountains when he set out to return home he had three silver cups 
 two handsome pistols and a silver this latter would be 
 useful when he began housekeeping but all these were not the heaviest weight he had to bear something mightier and more important he carried with him in his heart over the high mountains as he journeyed homeward 
 
 the weather was dismally dark and inclined to rain the clouds 
 hung low like a mourning veil on the tops of the mountains and 
 shrouded their glittering peaks in the woods could be heard the sound of the axe and the heavy fall of the trunks of the trees as they 
 rolled down the slopes of the mountains when seen from the heights 
 the trunks of these trees looked like slender stems but on a nearer 
 inspection they were found to be large and strong enough for the masts of a ship the river murmured monotonously the wind whistled and the 
 clouds sailed along hurriedly 
 suddenly there appeared close by side a young maiden 
 he had not noticed her till she came quite near to him she was also 
 going to ascend the mountain the eyes shone with an 
 unearthly power which obliged you to look into them they were 
 strange eyes clear deep and unfathomable 
 
 hast thou a lover asked rudy all his thoughts were naturally 
 on love just then 
 i have none answered the maiden with a laugh it was as if she 
 had not spoken the truth 
 do not let us go such a long way round said she we must 
 keep to the left it is much shorter 
 
 ah yes he replied and fall into some crevasse do you 
 pretend to be a guide and not know the road better than that 
 
 i know every step of the way said she and my thoughts are 
 collected while yours are down in the valley yonder we should 
 think of the ice maiden while we are up here men say she is not 
 kind to their race 
 
 i fear her not said rudy she could not keep me when i was a 
 child i will not give myself up to her now i am a man 
 darkness came on the rain fell and then it began to snow and 
 the whiteness dazzled the eyes 
 
 give me your hand said the maiden i will help you to 
 mount and he felt the touch of her icy fingers 
 
 you help me cried rudy i do not yet require a woman to help 
 me to climb and he stepped quickly forwards away from her 
 the drifting fell like a veil between them the wind 
 whistled and behind him he could hear the maiden laughing and 
 singing and the sound was most strange to hear 
 
 it certainly must be a spectre or a servant of the ice maiden 
 thought rudy who had heard such things talked about when he was a 
 little boy and had stayed all night on the mountain with the guides 
 
 the snow fell thicker than ever the clouds lay beneath him he 
 looked back there was no one to be seen but he heard sounds of 
 mocking laughter which were not those of a human voice 
 
 when rudy at length reached the highest part of the mountain 
 where the path led down to the valley of the rhone the snow had 
 ceased and in the clear heavens he saw two bright stars twinkling 
 
 they reminded him of babette and of himself and of his future 
 happiness and his heart glowed at the thought 
 vi the visit to the mill 
 what beautiful things you have brought home said his old 
 and her sparkled while 
 she wriggled and twisted her skinny neck more quickly and strangely 
 than ever you have brought good luck with you rudy i must give you a kiss my dear boy 
 
 rudy allowed himself to be kissed but it could be seen by his 
 countenance that he only endured the infliction as a homely duty 
 how handsome you are rudy said the old woman 
 flatter said rudy with a laugh but still he was pleased 
 i must say once more said the old woman that you are very 
 lucky 
 well in that i believe you are right said he as he thought of 
 babette never had he felt such a longing for that deep valley as he 
 now had they must have returned home by this time said he to 
 himself it is already two days over the time which they fixed 
 upon i must go to bex 
 
 so rudy set out to go to bex and when he arrived there he 
 found the miller and his daughter at home they received him kindly 
 and brought him many greetings from their friends at interlachen 
 babette did not say much she seemed to have become quite silent 
 but her eyes spoke and that was quite enough for rudy the miller had generally a great deal to talk about and seemed to expect that 
 every one should listen to his jokes and laugh at them for was not 
 he the rich miller but now he was more inclined to hear 
 adventures while hunting and travelling and to listen to his 
 descriptions of the difficulties the has to overcome on 
 the or of the dangerous which the wind 
 and weather cause to cling to the edges of the rocks or to lie in the 
 form of a frail bridge over the abyss beneath the eyes of the brave 
 rudy sparkled as he described the life of a hunter or spoke of the 
 cunning of the chamois and their wonderful leaps also of the powerful fohn and the rolling avalanche he noticed that the more he described the more interested the miller became especially when he spoke of the fierce vulture and of the royal eagle not far from bex in the canton valais was an nest more curiously built under a high rock in this nest was a young eagle but who would venture to take it a young englishman had offered rudy a whole handful of gold if he would bring him the young eagle alive 
 
 there is a liit to everything was reply the eagle 
 could not be taken it would be folly to attempt it 
 
 the wine was passed round freely and the conversation kept up 
 pleasantly but the evening seemed too short for rudy although it was midnight when he left the house after this his first visit 
 while the lights in the windows of the house still 
 twinkled through the green foliage out through the open skylight came the on to the roof and along the walked the to meet her 
 
 what is the news at the mill asked the here in the 
 house there is secret going on which the father knows 
 nothing about rudy and babette have been treading on each 
 paws under the table all the evening they trod on my tail twice 
 but i did not mew that would have attracted notice 
 
 well i should have mewed said the 
 
 what might suit the kitchen would not suit the parlor said 
 the other i am quite curious to know what the miller will say when 
 he finds out this engagement 
 
 yes indeed what would the miller say rudy himself was anxious 
 to know that but to wait till the miller heard of it from others 
 was out of the question therefore not many days after this visit he 
 was riding in the omnibus that runs between the two cantons valais 
 and vaud these cantons are separated by the rhone over which is a 
 bridge that unites them rudy as usual had plenty of courage and 
 indulged in pleasant thoughts of the favorable answer he should 
 receive that evening and when the omnibus returned rudy was again seated in it going homewards and at the same time the at the house ran out quickly crying 
 
 here you from the kitchen what do you think the miller knows 
 all now everything has come to a delightful end rudy came here 
 this evening and he and babette had much whispering and secret 
 conversation together they stood in the path near the 
 room i lay at their feet but they had no eyes or thoughts for me 
 
 i will go to your father at once said he it is the most 
 honorable way 
 
 shall i go with you asked babette it will give you courage 
 
 i have plenty of courage said rudy but if you are with me 
 he must be friendly whether he says yes or no 
 
 so they turned to go in and rudy trod heavily on my tail he 
 certainly is very clumsy i mewed but neither he nor babette had 
 any ears for me they opened the door and entered together i was 
 before them and jumped on the back of a chair i hardly know what 
 rudy said but the miller flew into a rage and threatened to kick him 
 out of the house he told him he might go to the mountains and look 
 after the chamois but not after our little babette 
 
 and what did they say did they speak asked the 
 what did they say why all that people generally do say when 
 they go i love her and she loves me and when there is 
 milk in the can for one there is milk in the can for two 
 but she is so far above you said the miller she has heaps of 
 gold as you know you should not attempt to reach her 
 there is nothing so high that a man cannot reach if he will 
 answered rudy for he is a brave youth 
 yet you could not reach the young eagle said the miller 
 laughing babette is higher than the nest 
 i will have them both said rudy 
 very well i will give her to you when you bring me the young 
 eaglet alive said the miller and he laughed till the tears stood in 
 his eyes but now i thank you for this visit rudy and if you come 
 you will find nobody at home rudy 
 babette also wished him farewell but her voice sounded as 
 mournful as the mew of a little kitten that has lost its mother 
 a promise is a promise between man and man said rudy do 
 not weep babette i shall bring the young eagle 
 you will break your neck i hope said the miller and we 
 shall be relieved from your company 
 i call that kicking him out of the house said the 
 and now rudy is gone and babette sits and weeps while the miller 
 sings german songs that he learnt on his journey but i do not trouble 
 myself on the matter it would be of no use 
 yet for all that it is a very strange affair said the 
 
 
 vii the nest 
 from the came a joyous sound of some person 
 whistling and it betokened good humor and undaunted courage it was rudy going to meet his friend vesinaud you must come and help said he i want to carry off the young eaglet from the top of the rock we will take young ragli with us 
 
 had you not better first try to take down the moon that would be 
 quite as easy a task said vesinaud you seem to be in good 
 spirits 
 
 yes indeed i am i am thinking of my wedding but to be serious 
 i will tell you all about it and how i am situated 
 
 then he explained to vesinaud and ragli what he wished to do 
 and why 
 
 you are a daring fellow said they but it is no use you 
 will break your neck 
 
 no one falls unless he is afraid said rudy 
 so at midnight they set out carrying with them poles ladders 
 and ropes the road lay amidst brushwood and underwood over rolling stones always upwards higher and higher in the dark night waters roared beneath them or fell in cascades from above humid clouds were driving through the air as the hunters reached the precipitous ledge of the rock it was even darker here for the sides of the rocks almost met and the light penetrated only through a small opening at the top at a little distance from the edge could be heard the sound of the roaring foaming waters in the yawning abyss beneath them 
 
 the three seated themselves on a stone to await in stillness the dawn 
 of day when the parent eagle would fly out as it would be 
 necessary to shoot the old bird before they could think of gaining 
 possession of the young one rudy sat motionless as if he had been 
 part of the stone on which he sat he held his gun ready to fire with 
 his eyes fixed steadily on the highest point of the cliff where the 
 nest lay concealed beneath the overhanging rock 
 
 the three hunters had a long time to wait at last they heard a 
 rustling whirring sound above them and a large hovering object 
 darkened the air two guns were ready to aim at the dark body of the 
 eagle as it rose from the nest then a shot was fired for an 
 instant the bird fluttered its wings and seemed as 
 if it would fill up the whole of the chasm and drag down the 
 hunters in its fall but it was not so the eagle sunk gradually 
 into the abyss beneath and the branches of trees and bushes were 
 broken by its weight then the hunters roused themselves three of the 
 longest ladders were brought and bound together the topmost ring of 
 these ladders would just reach the edge of the rock which hung over 
 the abyss but no farther the point beneath which the nest 
 lay sheltered was much higher and the sides of the rock were as 
 smooth as a wall after consulting together they determined to bind 
 together two more ladders and to hoist them over the cavity and so 
 form a communication with the three beneath them by binding the upper ones to the lower with great difficulty they contrived to drag the two ladders over the rock and there they hung for some moments swaying over the abyss but no sooner had they fastened them together than rudy placed his foot on the lowest step 
 
 it was a bitterly cold morning clouds of mist were rising from 
 beneath and rudy stood on the lower step of the ladder as a fly rests 
 on a piece of swinging straw which a bird may have dropped from the edge of the nest it was building on some tall factory chimney but the fly could fly away if the straw were shaken rudy could only break his neck the wind whistled around him and beneath him the waters of the abyss swelled by the thawing of the glaciers those palaces of the ice maiden foamed and roared in their rapid course 
 when rudy began to ascend the ladder trembled like the web of the spider when it draws out the long delicate threads but as soon as he 
 reached the fourth of the ladders which had been bound together he 
 felt more confidence he knew that they had been fastened securely by skilful hands the fifth ladder that appeared to reach the nest 
 was supported by the sides of the rock yet it swung to and fro and 
 flapped about like a slender reed and as if it had been bound by 
 fishing lines it seemed a most dangerous undertaking to ascend it 
 but rudy knew how to climb he had learnt that from the cat and he 
 had no fear he did not observe vertigo who stood in the air behind 
 him trying to lay hold of him with his outstretched polypous arms 
 when at length he stood on the topmost step of the ladder he 
 found that he was still some distance below the nest and not even 
 able to see into it only by using his hands and climbing could he 
 possibly reach it he tried the strength of the stunted trees and the 
 thick underwood upon which the nest rested and of which it was 
 formed and finding they would support his weight he grasped them 
 firmly and swung himself up from the ladder till his head and 
 breast were above the nest and then what an overpowering stench 
 came from it for in it lay the putrid remains of lambs chamois 
 and birds vertigo although he could not reach him blew the 
 poisonous vapor in his face to make him giddy and faint and beneath in the dark yawning deep on the rushing waters sat the ice 
 maiden with her long pale green hair falling around her and her 
 eyes fixed upon him like the two barrels of a gun i have 
 thee now she cried 
 
 in a corner of the nest sat the young eaglet a large 
 and powerful bird though still unable to fly rudy fixed his eyes 
 upon it held on by one hand with all his strength and with the other 
 threw a noose round the young eagle the string slipped to its legs 
 rudy tightened it and thus secured the bird alive then flinging 
 the sling over his shoulder so that the creature hung a good way down behind him he prepared to descend with the help of a rope and his foot soon touched safely the highest step of the ladder then rudy remembering his early lesson in climbing hold fast and do not fear descended carefully down the ladders and at last stood 
 safely on the ground with the young living eaglet where he was 
 received with loud shouts of joy and congratulations 
 
 viii what fresh news the had to tell 
 there is what you asked for said rudy as he entered the 
 house at bex and placed on the floor a large basket he 
 removed the lid as he spoke and a pair of yellow eyes encircled by a 
 black ring stared forth with a wild fiery glance that seemed 
 ready to burn and destroy all that came in its way its short 
 strong beak was open ready to bite and on its red throat were 
 short feathers like stubble 
 
 the young eaglet cried the miller 
 babette screamed and started back while her eyes wandered from 
 rudy to the bird in astonishment 
 
 you are not to be discouraged by difficulties i see said the 
 miller 
 
 and you will keep your word replied rudy each has his own 
 characteristic whether it is honor or courage 
 
 but how is it you did not break your neck asked the miller 
 
 because i held fast answered rudy and i mean to hold fast 
 to babette 
 
 you must get her first said the miller laughing and babette 
 thought this a very good sign 
 
 we must take the bird out of the basket said she it is 
 getting into a rage how its eyes glare how did you manage to conquer it 
 then rudy had to describe his adventure and the eyes 
 opened wide as he listened 
 with your courage and your good fortune you might win three 
 wives said the miller 
 oh thank you cried rudy 
 but you have not won babette yet said the miller slapping 
 the young alpine hunter on the shoulder playfully 
 have you heard the fresh news at the mill asked the 
 of the rudy has brought us the young eagle 
 and he is to take babette in exchange they kissed each other in the 
 presence of the old man which is as good as an engagement he was 
 quite civil about it drew in his claws and took his afternoon nap 
 so that the two were left to sit and wag their tails as much as they 
 pleased they have so much to talk about that it will not be 
 finished till christmas neither was it finished till christmas 
 
 the wind whirled the faded fallen leaves the snow drifted in the 
 valleys as well as upon the mountains and the ice maiden sat in 
 the stately palace which in winter time she generally occupied 
 
 the perpendicular rocks were covered with slippery ice and where in 
 summer the stream from the rocks had left a watery veil icicles large 
 and heavy hung from the trees while the 
 were decorated with fantastic garlands of crystal the ice maiden rode on the howling wind across the deep valleys the country as far as bex was covered with a carpet of snow so that the ice maiden could follow rudy and see him when he visited the mill and while in the room at the house where he was accustomed to spend so much of his time with babette the wedding was to take place in the 
 following summer and they heard enough of it for so many of their 
 friends spoke of the matter 
 
 then came sunshine to the mill the beautiful alpine roses 
 bloomed and joyous laughing babette was like the early spring 
 which makes all the birds sing of summer time and bridal days 
 
 how those two do sit and chatter together said the 
 i have had enough of their mewing 
 
 ix the ice maiden 
 the walnut and chestnut trees which extend from the bridge of st 
 maurice by the river rhone to the shores of the lake of geneva were already covered with the delicate green garlands of early spring just bursting into bloom while the rhone rushed wildly from its source among the green glaciers which form the ice palace of the ice 
 maiden she sometimes allows herself to be carried by the keen wind to the lofty where she stretches herself in the sunshine 
 on the soft from thence she throws her 
 glance into the deep valley beneath where human beings are busily 
 moving about like ants on a stone in the sun spirits of strength as 
 the children of the sun call you cried the ice maiden ye are but 
 worms let but a roll and you and your houses and your 
 towns are crushed and swept away and she raised her proud head 
 and looked around her with eyes that flashed death from their 
 glance from the valley came a rumbling sound men were busily at work blasting the rocks to form tunnels and laying down roads for the railway they are playing at work underground like moles said she 
 
 they are digging passages beneath the earth and the noise is like 
 the reports of cannons i shall throw down my palaces for the 
 clamor is louder than the roar of thunder then there ascended from 
 the valley a thick vapor which waved itself in the air like a 
 fluttering veil it rose as a plume of feathers from a steam engine 
 to which on the railway a string of carriages was 
 linked carriage to carriage looking like a winding serpent the 
 train shot past with the speed of an arrow they play at being 
 masters down there those spirits of strength exclaimed the ice 
 maiden but the powers of nature are still the rulers and she 
 laughed and sang till her voice sounded through the valley and people 
 said it was the rolling of an avalanche but the children of the sun 
 sang in louder strains in praise of the mind of man which can span 
 the sea as with a yoke can level mountains and fill up valleys it 
 is the power of thought which gives man the mastery over nature 
 just at this moment there came across the where the 
 ice maiden sat a party of travellers they had bound themselves 
 fast to each other so that they looked like one large body on the 
 slippery plains of ice encircling the deep abyss 
 
 worms exclaimed the ice maiden you the lords of the powers 
 of nature and she turned away and looked maliciously at the deep 
 valley where the railway train was rushing by there they sit 
 these thoughts she exclaimed there they sit in their power over 
 strength i see them all one sits proudly apart like a 
 king others sit together in a group yonder half of them are asleep 
 and when the steam dragon stops they will get out and go their way 
 the thoughts go forth into the world and she laughed 
 
 there goes another avalanche said those in the valley beneath 
 
 it will not reach us said two who sat together behind the steam 
 dragon two hearts and one beat as people say they were rudy and babette and the miller was with them i am like the luggage said he i am here as a necessary appendage 
 
 there sit those two said the ice maiden many a chamois have i 
 crushed millions of alpine roses have i snapped and broken off not a root have i spared i know them all and their thoughts those spirits 
 of strength and again she laughed 
 
 there rolls another avalanche said those in the valley 
 
 x the godmother 
 at montreux one of the towns which encircle the northeast part of 
 the lake of geneva lived godmother the noble english lady 
 with her daughters and a young relative they had only lately arrived 
 yet the miller had paid them a visit and informed them of 
 engagement to rudy the whole story of their meeting at interlachen 
 and his brave adventure with the eaglet were related to them and 
 they were all very much interested and as pleased about rudy and 
 babette as the miller himself the three were invited to come to 
 montreux it was but right for babette to become acquainted with her 
 godmother who wished to see her very much a started 
 from the town of villeneuve at one end of the lake of geneva and 
 arrived at bernex a little town beyond montreux in about half an 
 hour and in this boat the miller with his daughter and rudy set 
 out to visit her godmother they passed the coast which has been so 
 celebrated in song here under the by the deep blue 
 lake sat byron and wrote his melodious verses about the prisoner 
 confined in the gloomy castle of chillon here where clarens with 
 its is reflected in the clear water wandered 
 rousseau dreaming of heloise the river rhone glides gently by 
 beneath the lofty hills of savoy and not far from its 
 mouth lies a little island in the lake so small that seen from the 
 shore it looks like a ship the surface of the island is rocky and 
 about a hundred years ago a lady caused the ground to be covered with earth in which three were planted and the whole 
 enclosed with stone walls the now overshadow every 
 part of the island babette was enchanted with the spot it seemed 
 to her the most beautiful object in the whole voyage and she 
 thought how much she should like to land there but the 
 passed it by and did not stop till it reached bernex the little 
 party walked slowly from this place to montreux passing the 
 walls with which the vineyards of the little mountain town of montreux are surrounded and peasants houses overshadowed by with gardens in which grow the laurel and the cypress 
 halfway up the hill stood the in which 
 godmother resided she was received most cordially her godmother 
 was a very friendly woman with a round smiling countenance when a child her head must have resembled one of cherubs it was still an angelic face with its white locks of silvery hair the 
 daughters were tall elegant slender maidens 
 
 the young cousin whom they had brought with them was dressed 
 in white from head to foot he had golden hair and golden whiskers 
 large enough to be divided amongst three gentlemen and he began 
 immediately to pay the greatest attention to babette 
 
 richly bound books and drawings lay on the large 
 table the balcony window stood open and from it could be seen the 
 beautiful wide extended lake the water so clear and still that the 
 mountains of savoy with their villages woods and 
 peaks were clearly reflected in it 
 
 rudy who was usually so lively and brave did not in the least 
 feel himself at home he acted as if he were walking on peas over a 
 slippery floor how long and wearisome the time appeared it was 
 like being in a treadmill and then they went out for a walk which 
 was very slow and tedious two steps forward and one backwards had rudy to take to keep pace with the others they walked down to 
 chillon and went over the old castle on the rocky island they saw 
 the implements of torture the deadly dungeons the rusty fetters in 
 the rocky walls the stone benches for those condemned to death the 
 through which the unhappy creatures were hurled upon iron spikes and impaled alive they called looking at all these a 
 pleasure it certainly was the right place to visit poetry 
 had made it celebrated in the world rudy could only feel that it 
 was a place of execution he leaned against the stone framework of the window and gazed down into the deep blue water and over to the little island with the three acacias and wished himself there away 
 and free from the whole chattering party but babette was most 
 unusually lively and 
 
 i have been so amused she said 
 the cousin had found her quite perfect 
 
 he is a perfect fop said rudy and this was the first time rudy 
 had said anything that did not please babette 
 
 the englishman had made her a present of a little book in 
 remembrance of their visit to chillon it was poem the 
 prisoner of chillon translated into french so that babette could 
 read it 
 
 the book may be very good said rudy but that finely combed 
 fellow who gave it to you is not worth much 
 
 he looks something like a without any flour said the 
 miller laughing at his own wit rudy laughed too for so had he 
 appeared to him 
 
 xi the cousin 
 when rudy went a few days after to pay a visit to the mill he 
 found the young englishman there babette was just thinking of 
 preparing some trout to set before him she understood well how to 
 garnish the dish with parsley and make it look quite tempting rudy 
 thought all this quite unnecessary what did the englishman want 
 there what was he about why should he be entertained and waited 
 upon by babette rudy was jealous and that made babette happy it 
 amused her to discover all the feelings of his heart the strong 
 points and weak ones love was to her as yet only a pastime and she 
 played with whole heart at the same time it must be 
 acknowledged that her fortune her whole life her inmost thoughts 
 her best and most noble feelings in this world were all for him still 
 the more gloomy he looked the more her eyes laughed she could almost have kissed the fair englishman with the golden whiskers if by so doing she could have put rudy in a rage and made him run out of the house that would have proved how much he loved her all this was not right in babette but she was only nineteen years of age and she did not reflect on what she did neither did she think that her 
 conduct would appear to the young englishman as light and not even 
 becoming the modest and daughter of the miller 
 
 the mill at bex stood in the highway which passed under the 
 mountains and not far from a rapid whose waters seemed to have been lashed into a foam like 
 this stream however did not pass near enough to the mill and therefore the was turned by a smaller stream which tumbled down the rocks on the opposite side where it was opposed by a stone and obtained greater strength and speed till it fell into a large basin and from thence through a channel to the 
 this channel sometimes overflowed and made the path so slippery that any one passing that way might easily fall in and be carried towards the mill wheel with frightful rapidity such a catastrophe nearly happened to the young englishman he had dressed himself in white clothes like a man and was climbing the path to the 
 house but he had never been taught to climb and therefore 
 slipped and nearly went in he managed however to 
 scramble out with wet sleeves and bespattered trousers still wet and 
 splashed with mud he contrived to reach window to which he had been guided by the light that shone from it here he climbed the old that stood near it and began to imitate the voice 
 of an owl the only bird he could venture to mimic babette heard 
 the noise and glanced through the thin window curtain but when she 
 saw the man in white and guessed who he was her little heart beat 
 with terror as well as anger she quickly put out the light felt if 
 the fastening of the window was secure and then left him to howl as 
 long as he liked how dreadful it would be thought babette if rudy 
 were here in the house but rudy was not in the house no it was much worse he was outside standing just under the he was speaking loud angry words he could fight and there might be murder 
 
 babette opened the window in alarm and called name she told him to go away she did not wish him to remain there 
 you do not wish me to stay cried he then this is an 
 appointment you expected this good friend whom you prefer to me 
 shame on you babette 
 you are detestable exclaimed babette bursting into tears 
 go away i hate you 
 i have not deserved this said rudy as he turned away his 
 cheeks burning and his heart like fire 
 babette threw herself on the bed and wept bitterly so much as i 
 loved thee rudy and yet thou canst think ill of me 
 thus her anger broke forth it relieved her however otherwise 
 she would have been more deeply grieved but now she could sleep 
 soundly as youth only can sleep 
 
 xii evil powers 
 rudy left bex and took his way home along the mountain path 
 the air was fresh but cold for here amidst the deep snow the ice 
 maiden reigned he was so high up that the large trees beneath him 
 with their thick foliage appeared like garden plants and the pines 
 and bushes even less the alpine roses grew near the snow which lay in detached stripes and looked like linen laid out to bleach a 
 blue gentian grew in his path and he crushed it with the butt end 
 of his gun a little higher up he espied two chamois eyes 
 glistened and his thoughts flew at once in a different direction but 
 he was not near enough to take a sure aim he ascended still higher 
 to a spot where a few rough blades of grass grew between the blocks of stone and the chamois passed quietly on over the 
 rudy walked hurriedly while the clouds of mist gathered round him 
 suddenly he found himself on the brink of a precipitous rock the rain was falling in torrents he felt a burning thirst his head was hot 
 and his limbs trembled with cold he seized his but 
 it was empty he had not thought of filling it before ascending the 
 mountain he had never been ill in his life nor ever experienced such 
 sensations as those he now felt he was so tired that he could 
 scarcely resist lying down at his full length to sleep although the 
 ground was flooded with the rain yet when he tried to rouse himself a little every object around him danced and trembled before his eyes 
 suddenly he observed in the doorway of a hut newly built under the 
 rock a young maiden he did not remember having seen this hut before yet there it stood and he thought at first that the young maiden was annette the daughter whom he had once kissed in the dance the maiden was not annette yet it seemed as if he had seen 
 her somewhere before perhaps near grindelwald on the evening of 
 his return home from interlachen after the 
 how did you come here he asked 
 i am at home she replied i am watching my flocks 
 your flocks he exclaimed where do they find pasture there is 
 nothing here but snow and rocks 
 much you know of what grows here she replied laughing not 
 far beneath us there is beautiful my goats go there i 
 tend them carefully i never miss one what is once mine remains 
 mine 
 
 you are bold said rudy 
 and so are you she answered 
 have you any milk in the house he asked if so give me some 
 to drink my thirst is intolerable 
 i have something better than milk she replied which i will 
 give you some travellers who were here yesterday with their guide 
 left behind them a half a flask of wine such as you have never 
 tasted they will not come back to fetch it i know and i shall not 
 drink it so you shall have it 
 
 then the maiden went to fetch the wine poured some into a 
 wooden cup and offered it to rudy 
 
 how good it is said he i have never before tasted such 
 warm invigorating wine and his eyes sparkled with new life a 
 glow diffused itself over his frame it seemed as if every sorrow 
 every oppression were banished from his mind and a fresh free nature were stirring within him you are surely annette the 
 daughter cried he will you give me a kiss 
 yes if you will give me that beautiful ring which you wear on 
 your finger 
 my betrothal ring he replied 
 yes just so said the maiden as she poured out some more wine 
 and held it to his lips again he drank and a living joy streamed 
 through every vein 
 the whole world is mine why therefore should i grieve 
 thought he everything is created for our enjoyment and happiness 
 the stream of life is a stream of happiness let us flow on with it to 
 joy and felicity 
 
 rudy gazed on the young maiden it was annette and yet it was not 
 annette still less did he suppose it was the spectral phantom whom 
 he had met near grindelwald the maiden up here on the mountain was fresh as the new fallen snow blooming as an alpine rose and as 
 as a young kid still she was one of race 
 like rudy he flung his arms round the beautiful being and gazed into 
 her wonderfully clear eyes only for a moment but in that moment 
 words cannot express the effect of his gaze was it the spirit of life 
 or of death that overpowered him was he rising higher or sinking 
 lower and lower into the deep deadly abyss he knew not but the 
 walls of ice shone like glass innumerable clefts yawned 
 around him and the tinkled like the chiming of church 
 bells and shone clearly as pearls in the light of a 
 flame the ice maiden for she it was kissed him and her kiss sent a 
 chill as of ice through his whole frame a cry of agony escaped from 
 him he struggled to get free and tottered from her for a moment all 
 was dark before his eyes but when he opened them again it was 
 light and the alpine maiden had vanished the powers of evil had 
 played their game the sheltering hut was no more to be seen the 
 water trickled down the naked sides of the rocks and snow lay thickly all around rudy shivered with cold he was wet through to the skin and his ring was gone the betrothal ring that babette had given him 
 
 his gun lay near him in the snow he took it up and tried to discharge 
 it but it missed fire heavy clouds lay on the mountain clefts 
 like firm masses of snow upon one of these vertigo sat lurking after 
 his powerless prey and from beneath came a sound as if a piece of 
 rock had fallen from the cleft and was crushing everything that stood 
 in its way or opposed its course 
 
 but at the babette sat alone and wept rudy had not 
 been to see her for six days he who was in the wrong and who ought to ask her forgiveness for did she not love him with her whole heart 
 
 xiii at the mill 
 what strange creatures human beings are said the 
 to the babette and rudy have fallen out with each other 
 she sits and cries and he thinks no more about her 
 that does not please me to hear said the 
 nor me either replied the but i do not take it 
 to heart babette may fall in love with the red whiskers if she 
 likes but he has not been here since he tried to get on the roof 
 the powers of evil carry on their game both around us and within 
 us rudy knew this and thought a great deal about it what was it 
 that had happened to him on the mountain was it really a ghostly 
 apparition or a fever dream rudy knew nothing of fever or any other ailment but while he judged babette he began to examine his own conduct he had allowed wild thoughts to chase each other in his heart and a fierce tornado to break loose could he confess to 
 babette indeed every thought which in the hour of temptation might 
 have led him to wrong doing he had lost her ring and that very 
 loss had won him back to her could she expect him to confess he felt as if his heart would break while he thought of it and while so 
 many memories lingered on his mind he saw her again as she once 
 stood before him a laughing spirited child many loving words which she had spoken to him out of the fulness of her love came like a ray of sunshine into his heart and soon it was all sunshine as he 
 thought of babette but she must also confess she was wrong that 
 she should do 
 
 he went to the mill he went to confession it began with a 
 kiss and ended with rudy being considered the offender it was such a great fault to doubt truth it was most abominable of him 
 such mistrust such violence would cause them both great unhappiness 
 
 this certainly was very true she knew that and therefore babette 
 preached him a little sermon with which she was herself much 
 amused and during the preaching of which she looked quite lovely 
 she acknowledged however that on one point rudy was right her 
 nephew was a fop she intended to burn the book which he had given her so that not the slightest thing should remain to remind her of him 
 well that quarrel is all over said the rudy is 
 come back and they are friends again which they say is the 
 greatest of all pleasures 
 i heard the rats say one night said the that 
 the greatest pleasure in the world was to eat tallow candles and to 
 feast on rancid bacon which are we to believe the rats or the 
 lovers 
 neither of them said the it is always the safest 
 plan to believe nothing you hear 
 
 the greatest happiness was coming for rudy and babette the 
 happy day as it is called that is their was near at 
 hand they were not to be married at the church at bex nor at the 
 house godmother wished the nuptials to be 
 solemnized at montreux in the pretty little church in that town 
 
 the miller was very anxious that this arrangement should be agreed to 
 
 he alone knew what the couple would receive from 
 godmother and he knew also that it was a wedding present 
 well worth a concession the day was fixed and they were to travel as far as villeneuve the evening before to be in time for the steamer 
 which sailed in the morning for montreux and the 
 daughters were to dress and adorn the bride 
 
 here in this house there ought to be a kept said 
 the or else i would not give a mew for the whole affair 
 there is going to be great feasting replied the 
 ducks and pigeons have been killed and a whole roebuck hangs on 
 the wall it makes me lick my lips when i think of it 
 morning they will begin the journey 
 yes and this evening for the last time rudy and 
 babette sat in the house as an engaged couple outside the 
 alps glowed in the evening sunset the evening bells chimed and the 
 children of the sunbeam sang whatever happens is best 
 
 xiv night visions 
 the sun had gone down and the clouds lay low on the valley of the 
 rhone the wind blew from the south across the mountains it was an 
 african wind a wind which scattered the clouds for a moment and then suddenly fell the broken clouds hung in fantastic forms upon the hills by the rapid rhone they assumed the shapes of antediluvian animals of eagles hovering in the air of frogs 
 leaping over a marsh and then sunk down upon the rushing stream and appeared to sail upon it although floating in the air an uprooted 
 was being carried away by the current and marking out its 
 path by eddying circles on the water vertigo and his sisters were 
 dancing upon it and raising these circles on the foaming river the 
 moon lighted up the snow on the shone on the dark 
 woods and on the drifting clouds those fantastic forms which at night might be taken for spirits of the powers of nature the 
 saw them through the panes of his little window 
 they sailed in hosts before the ice maiden as she came out of her palace of ice then she seated herself on the trunk of the as on a broken skiff and the water from the glaciers carried her down the 
 river to the open lake 
 
 the wedding guests are coming sounded from air and sea these 
 were the sights and sounds without within there were visions for 
 babette had a wonderful dream she dreamt that she had been married to rudy for many years and that one day when he was out chamois hunting and she alone in their dwelling at home the young englishman 
 with the golden whiskers sat with her his eyes were quite eloquent 
 and his words possessed a magic power he offered her his hand and 
 she was obliged to follow him they went out of the house and 
 stepped downwards always downwards and it seemed to babette as if she had a weight on her heart which continually grew heavier she felt she was committing a sin against rudy a sin against god 
 suddenly she found herself forsaken her clothes torn by the thorns and her hair gray she looked upwards in her agony and there on the edge of the rock she espied rudy she stretched out her arms to him but she did not venture to call him or to pray and had she called him it would have been useless for it was not rudy only his hunting coat and hat hanging on an alpenstock as the hunters sometimes arrange them to deceive the chamois oh she exclaimed in her agony oh that i had died on the happiest day of my life my o my god it would have been a mercy and a blessing had rudy travelled far away from me and i had never known him none know what will happen in the future and then in ungodly despair she cast herself down into the deep rocky gulf the spell was broken a cry of terror escaped her and she awoke 
 the dream was over it had vanished but she knew she had dreamt 
 something frightful about the young englishman yet months had 
 passed since she had seen him or even thought of him was he still 
 at montreux and should she meet him there on her wedding day a 
 slight shadow passed over her pretty mouth as she thought of this and she knit her brows but the smile soon returned to her lip and joy 
 sparkled in her eyes for this was the morning of the day on which she 
 and rudy were to be married and the sun was shining brightly rudy 
 was already in the parlor when she entered it and they very soon 
 started for villeneuve both of them were overflowing with 
 happiness and the miller was in the best of tempers laughing and 
 merry he was a good honest soul and a kind father 
 now we are masters of the house said the 
 
 xv the conclusion 
 it was early in the afternoon and just at when the 
 three joyous travellers reached villeneuve after dinner the miller 
 placed himself in the smoked his pipe and had a little 
 nap the bridal pair went out through the town and along 
 the high road at the foot of the rocks and by the deep blue lake 
 
 the gray walls and the heavy towers of the 
 gloomy castle of chillon were reflected in the clear flood the 
 little island on which grew the three acacias lay at a short 
 distance looking like a bouquet rising from the lake how delightful 
 it must be to live there said babette who again felt the greatest 
 wish to visit the island and an opportunity offered to gratify her 
 wish at once for on the shore lay a boat and the rope by which it 
 was moored could be very easily loosened they saw no one near so 
 they took possession of it without asking permission of any one and 
 rudy could row very well the oars divided the pliant water like the 
 fins of a fish that water which with all its yielding softness is 
 so strong to bear and to carry so mild and smiling when at rest 
 and yet so terrible in its destroying power a white streak of foam 
 followed in the wake of the boat which in a few minutes carried 
 them both to the little island where they went on shore but there 
 was only just room enough for two to dance rudy swung babette round two or three times and then they sat down on a 
 little bench under the drooping and looked into each 
 eyes while everything around them glowed in the rays of the 
 setting sun 
 
 the forests on the mountains were covered with a purple 
 hue like the heather bloom and where the woods terminated and the 
 rocks became prominent they looked almost transparent in the rich 
 crimson glow of the evening sky the surface of the lake was like a 
 bed of pink 
 
 as the evening advanced the shadows fell upon the 
 mountains of savoy painting them in colors of deep blue while their 
 topmost peaks glowed like red lava and for a moment this light was 
 reflected on the cultivated parts of the mountains making them appear as if newly risen from the lap of earth and giving to the 
 peak of the dent du midi the appearance of the full 
 moon as it rises above the horizon 
 
 rudy and babette felt that they had never seen the alpine glow 
 in such perfection before how very beautiful it is and what 
 happiness to be here exclaimed babette 
 
 earth has nothing more to bestow upon me said rudy an evening 
 like this is worth a whole life often have i realized my good 
 fortune but never more than in this moment i feel that if my 
 existence were to end now i should still have lived a happy life 
 what a glorious world this is one day ends and another begins even 
 more beautiful than the last how infinitely good god is babette 
 i have such complete happiness in my heart said she 
 earth has no more to bestow answered rudy and then came the 
 sound of the evening bells borne upon the breeze over the mountains 
 of switzerland and savoy while still in the golden splendor of the 
 west stood the dark blue mountains of jura 
 god grant you all that is brightest and best exclaimed babette 
 he will said rudy he will you will be 
 wholly mine my own sweet wife 
 the boat cried babette suddenly the boat in which they were 
 to return had broken loose and was floating away from the island 
 i will fetch it back said rudy throwing off his coat and 
 boots he sprang into the lake and swam with strong efforts towards 
 it 
 
 the water from the glaciers of the mountains was icy 
 cold and very deep rudy gave but one glance into the water beneath 
 but in that one glance he saw a gold ring rolling glittering and 
 sparkling before him his engaged ring came into his mind but this 
 was larger and spread into a glittering circle in which appeared a 
 clear glacier deep chasms yawned around it the glittered as if lighted with blue flame and tinkled like the chiming of 
 church bells in one moment he saw what would require many words to describe young hunters and young maidens men and women who had sunk in the deep chasms of the glaciers stood before him here in lifelike forms with eyes open and smiles on their lips and far 
 beneath them could be heard the chiming of the church bells of 
 buried villages where the villagers knelt beneath the vaulted 
 arches of churches in which formed the organ pipes and the mountain stream the music 
 
 on the clear transparent ground sat the ice maiden she raised 
 herself towards rudy and kissed his feet and instantly a cold 
 deathly chill like an electric shock passed through his limbs ice 
 or fire it was impossible to tell the shock was so instantaneous 
 mine mine sounded around him and within him i kissed thee 
 when thou wert a little child i once kissed thee on the mouth and 
 now i have kissed thee from heel to toe thou art wholly mine and 
 then he disappeared in the clear blue water 
 
 all was still the church bells were silent the last tone floated 
 away with the last red glimmer on the evening clouds thou art mine sounded from the depths below but from the heights above from the eternal world also sounded the words thou art mine happy was he thus to pass from life to life from earth to heaven a chord was loosened and tones of sorrow burst forth the icy kiss of death had overcome the perishable body it was but the prelude before real drama could begin the discord which was quickly lost in harmony 
 
 do you think this a sad story poor babette for her it was 
 unspeakable anguish 
 
 the boat drifted farther and farther away no one on the 
 opposite shore knew that the betrothed pair had gone over to the 
 little island the clouds sunk as the evening drew on and it became 
 dark alone in despair she waited and trembled the weather became fearful flash after flash lighted up the mountains of jura savoy and switzerland while peals of thunder that lasted for many minutes rolled over her head the lightning was so vivid that every single vine stem could be seen for a moment as distinctly as in the 
 sunlight at and then all was veiled in darkness it 
 flashed across the lake in winding zigzag lines lighting it up on 
 all sides while the echoes of the thunder grew louder and stronger 
 on land the boats were all carefully drawn up on the beach every 
 living thing sought shelter and at length the rain poured down in 
 torrents 
 
 where can rudy and babette be in this awful weather said the 
 miller 
 
 poor babette sat with her hands clasped and her head bowed 
 down dumb with grief she had ceased to weep and cry for help 
 in the deep water she said to herself far down he lies as if 
 beneath a glacier 
 
 deep in her heart rested the memory of what rudy had told her of 
 the death of his mother and of his own recovery even after he had 
 been taken up as dead from the cleft in the glacier 
 
 ah she thought the ice maiden has him at last 
 suddenly there came a flash of lightning as dazzling as the 
 rays of the sun on the white snow the lake rose for a moment like a 
 shining glacier and before babette stood the pallid glittering 
 majestic form of the ice maiden and at her feet lay corpse 
 mine she cried and again all was darkness around the heaving 
 water 
 
 how cruel murmured babette why should he die just as the 
 day of happiness drew near merciful god enlighten my 
 understanding shed light upon my heart for i cannot comprehend the 
 arrangements of thy providence even while i bow to the decree of 
 thy almighty wisdom and power and god did enlighten her heart 
 
 a sudden flash of thought like a ray of mercy recalled her dream 
 of the preceding night all was vividly represented before her she 
 remembered the words and wishes she had then expressed that what 
 was best for her and for rudy she might piously submit to 
 woe is me she said was the germ of sin really in my heart 
 was my dream a glimpse into the course of my future life whose thread must be violently broken to rescue me from sin oh miserable creature that i am 
 
 thus she sat lamenting in the dark night while through the deep 
 stillness the last words of rudy seemed to ring in her ears this 
 earth has nothing more to bestow words uttered in the fulness of 
 joy were again heard amid the depths of sorrow 
 
 years have passed since this sad event happened the shores of the 
 peaceful lake still smile in beauty the vines are full of luscious 
 grapes steamboats with waving flags pass swiftly by 
 
 with their swelling sails skim lightly over the 
 watery mirror like white butterflies the railway is opened beyond 
 chillon and goes far into the deep valley of the rhone at every 
 station strangers alight with in their hands in 
 which they read of every place worth seeing they visit chillon and 
 observe on the lake the little island with the three acacias and then 
 read in their the story of the bridal pair who in the year 
 rowed over to it they read that the two were missing till the 
 next morning when some people on the shore heard the despairing cries of the bride and went to her assistance and by her were told of 
 the fate 
 
 but the does not speak of quiet life 
 afterwards with her father not at the mill strangers dwell there 
 now but in a pretty house in a row near the station on many an 
 evening she sits at her window and looks out over the 
 to the mountains on which rudy once roamed 
 
 she looks at the alpine glow in the evening sky which is caused by 
 the children of the sun retiring to rest on the and 
 again they breathe their song of the traveller whom the whirlwind 
 could deprive of his cloak but not of his life there is a rosy tint 
 on the mountain snow and there are rosy gleams in each heart in which dwells the thought god permits nothing to happen which is not the best for us but this is not often revealed to all as it was 
 revealed to babette in her wonderful dream

 chapter vi 
 
 sister simplice put to the proof 
 but at that moment fantine was joyous 
 she had passed a very bad night her cough was frightful her fever had doubled in intensity she had had dreams 
 in the morning when the doctor paid his visit she was delirious he assumed an alarmed look and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m madeleine arrived 
 all the morning she was melancholy said but little and laid plaits in her sheets murmuring the while in a low voice calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances her eyes were hollow and staring 
 they seemed almost extinguished at intervals then lighted up again and shone like stars it seems as though at the approach of a certain dark hour the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth 
 each time that sister simplice asked her how she felt she replied invariably well 
 i should like to see m madeleine 
 some months before this at the moment when fantine had just lost her last modesty her last shame and her last joy she was the shadow of herself now she was the spectre of herself 
 physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering 
 this creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow flabby cheeks pinched nostrils teeth from which the gums had receded a leaden complexion a bony neck prominent frail limbs a clayey skin and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray alas how illness improvises 
 at the physician returned gave some directions inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary and shook his head 
 m madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three as exactness is kindness he was exact 
 about two fantine began to be restless 
 in the course of twenty minutes she asked the nun more than ten times what time is it sister 
 three struck 
 at the third stroke fantine sat up in bed she who could in general hardly turn over joined her yellow fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp and the nun heard her utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection then fantine turned and looked at the door 
 no one entered the door did not open 
 she remained thus for a quarter of an hour her eyes riveted on the door motionless and apparently holding her breath 
 the sister dared not speak to her 
 the clock struck a quarter past three fantine fell back on her pillow 
 she said nothing but began to plait the sheets once more 
 half an hour passed then an hour no one came every time the clock struck fantine started up and looked towards the door then fell back again 
 her thought was clearly perceptible but she uttered no name she made no complaint she blamed no one 
 but she coughed in a melancholy way one would have said that something dark was descending upon her she was livid and her lips were blue 
 she smiled now and then 
 five struck 
 then the sister heard her say very low and gently he is wrong not to come since i am going away 
 sister simplice herself was surprised at m delay 
 in the meantime fantine was staring at the tester of her bed she seemed to be endeavoring to recall something 
 all at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath 
 the nun listened this is what fantine was things we will buy 
 as we stroll the faubourgs through 
 roses are pink are blue 
 i love my love are blue 
 the virgin mary came near my stove in a broidered mantle clad and said to me here hide neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me 
 haste to the city buy linen buy a needle buy thread 
 lovely things we will buy 
 as we stroll the faubourgs through 
 dear holy virgin beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbons decked 
 god may give me his loveliest star i prefer the child thou hast granted me 
 madame what shall i do with this linen of it clothes for thy babe 
 roses are pink and are blue 
 i love my love and are blue 
 wash this the stream 
 make of it soiling not spoiling not a petticoat fair with its bodice fine which i will embroider and fill with the child is no longer here what is to be make of it a in which to bury me 
 lovely things we will buy 
 as we stroll the faubourgs through 
 roses are pink are blue 
 i love my love are blue 
 this song was an old cradle romance with which she had in former days lulled her little cosette to sleep and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child 
 she sang it in so sad a voice and to so sweet an air that it was enough to make any one even a nun weep 
 the sister accustomed as she was to austerities felt a tear spring to her eyes 
 the clock struck six 
 fantine did not seem to hear it 
 she no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her 
 sister simplice sent a to inquire of the portress of the factory whether the mayor had returned and if he would not come to the infirmary soon 
 the girl returned in a few minutes 
 fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts 
 the servant informed sister simplice in a very low tone that the mayor had set out that morning before six in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse cold as the weather was that he had gone alone without even a driver that no one knew what road he had taken that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to arras that others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris that when he went away he had been very gentle as usual and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night 
 while the two women were whispering together with their backs turned to bed the sister interrogating the servant conjecturing fantine with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death had raised herself to her knees in bed with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains and was listening all at once she cried 
 you are speaking of m madeleine 
 why are you talking so low what is he doing 
 why does he not come 
 her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man they wheeled round in affright 
 answer me cried fantine 
 the servant stammered 
 the portress told me that he could not come 
 be calm my child said the sister lie down again 
 fantine without changing her attitude continued in a loud voice and with an accent that was both imperious and 
 he cannot come 
 why not 
 you know the reason 
 you are whispering it to each other there 
 i want to know it 
 the hastened to say in the ear say that he is busy with the city council 
 sister simplice blushed faintly for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her 
 on the other hand it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would without doubt deal her a terrible blow and that this was a serious matter in present state her flush did not last long the sister raised her calm sad eyes to fantine and said monsieur le maire has gone away 
 fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed her eyes sparkled indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face 
 gone she cried he has gone to get cosette 
 then she raised her arms to heaven and her white face became ineffable her lips moved she was praying in a low voice 
 when her prayer was finished sister she said i am willing to lie down again i will do anything you wish i was naughty just now i beg your pardon for having spoken so loud it is very wrong to talk loudly i know that well my good sister but you see i am very happy 
 the good god is good m madeleine is good just think he has gone to montfermeil to get my little cosette 
 she lay down again with the assistance helped the nun to arrange her pillow and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck and which sister simplice had given her 
 my child said the sister try to rest now and do not talk any more 
 fantine took the hand in her moist hands and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration 
 he set out this morning for paris in fact he need not even go through paris montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence do you remember how he said to me yesterday when i spoke to him of cosette soon soon 
 he wants to give me a surprise you know he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the thenardiers they cannot say anything can they they will give back cosette for they have been paid the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay do not make signs to me that i must not talk sister 
 i am extremely happy i am doing well i am not ill at all any more i am going to see cosette again i am even quite hungry it is nearly five years since i saw her last you cannot imagine how much attached one gets to children and then she will be so pretty you will see 
 if you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had 
 in the first place she will have very beautiful hands she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old like this she must be a big girl now she is seven years old she is quite a young lady i call her cosette but her name is really euphrasie stop this morning i was looking at the dust on the and i had a sort of idea come across me like that that i should see cosette again soon 
 mon dieu how wrong it is not to see children for years 
 one ought to reflect that life is not eternal oh how good m le maire is to go it is very cold it is true he had on his cloak at least he will be here will he not will be a festival day morning sister you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it what a place that montfermeil is 
 i took that journey on foot once it was very long for me but the diligences go very quickly he will be here with cosette 
 how far is it from here to montfermeil 
 the sister who had no idea of distances replied oh i think that be will be here 
 said fantine i shall see cosette you see good sister of the good god that i am no longer ill i am mad i could dance if any one wished it 
 a person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change she was all rosy now she spoke in a lively and natural voice her whole face was one smile now and then she talked she laughed softly the joy of a mother is almost infantile 
 well resumed the nun now that you are happy mind me and do not talk any more 
 fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice yes lie down again be good for you are going to have your child sister simplice is right every one here is right 
 and then without stirring without even moving her head she began to stare all about her with eyes and a joyous air and she said nothing more 
 the sister drew the curtains together again hoping that she would fall into a doze 
 between seven and eight the doctor came not hearing any sound he thought fantine was asleep entered softly and approached the bed on tiptoe he opened the curtains a little and by the light of the taper he saw big eyes gazing at him 
 she said to him she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed will she not sir 
 the doctor thought that she was delirious 
 she added 
 see there is just room 
 the doctor took sister simplice aside and she explained matters to him that m madeleine was absent for a day or two and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid who believed that the mayor had gone to montfermeil that it was possible after all that her guess was correct the doctor approved 
 he returned to bed and she went on 
 you see when she wakes up in the morning i shall be able to say good morning to her poor kitten and when i cannot sleep at night i can hear her asleep her little gentle breathing will do me good 
 give me your hand said the doctor 
 she stretched out her arm and exclaimed with a laugh 
 ah hold in truth you did not know it i am cured cosette will arrive 
 the doctor was surprised she was better the pressure on her chest had decreased her pulse had regained its strength a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor creature 
 doctor she went on did the sister tell you that m le maire has gone to get that mite of a child 
 the doctor recommended silence and that all painful emotions should be avoided he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona and in case the fever should increase again during the night a calming potion as he took his departure he said to the sister 
 she is doing better if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive with the child who knows there are crises so astounding great joy has been known to arrest maladies i know well that this is an organic disease and in an advanced state but all those things are such mysteries 
 we may be able to save her

 her thought was clearly perceptible but she uttered no name she made no complaint she blamed no one 
 but she coughed in a melancholy way one would have said that something dark was descending upon her she was livid and her lips were blue 
 she smiled now and then 
 five struck 
 then the sister heard her say very low and gently he is wrong not to come since i am going away 
 sister simplice herself was surprised at m delay 
 in the meantime fantine was staring at the tester of her bed she seemed to be endeavoring to recall something 
 all at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath 
 the nun listened this is what fantine was things we will buy 
 as we stroll the faubourgs through 
 roses are pink are blue 
 i love my love are blue 
 the virgin mary came near my stove in a broidered mantle clad and said to me here hide neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me 
 haste to the city buy linen buy a needle buy thread 
 lovely things we will buy 
 as we stroll the faubourgs through 
 dear holy virgin beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbons decked 
 god may give me his loveliest star i prefer the child thou hast granted me 
 madame what shall i do with this linen of it clothes for thy babe 
 roses are pink and are blue 
 i love my love and are blue 
 wash this the stream 
 make of it soiling not spoiling not a petticoat fair with its bodice fine which i will embroider and fill with the child is no longer here what is to be make of it a in which to bury me 
 lovely things we will buy 
 as we stroll the faubourgs through 
 roses are pink are blue 
 i love my love are blue 
 this song was an old cradle romance with which she had in former days lulled her little cosette to sleep and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child 
 she sang it in so sad a voice and to so sweet an air that it was enough to make any one even a nun weep 
 the sister accustomed as she was to austerities felt a tear spring to her eyes 
 the clock struck six 
 fantine did not seem to hear it 
 she no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her 
 sister simplice sent a to inquire of the portress of the factory whether the mayor had returned and if he would not come to the infirmary soon 
 the girl returned in a few minutes 
 fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts 
 the servant informed sister simplice in a very low tone that the mayor had set out that morning before six in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse cold as the weather was that he had gone alone without even a driver that no one knew what road he had taken that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to arras that others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris that when he went away he had been very gentle as usual and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night 
 while the two women were whispering together with their backs turned to bed the sister interrogating the servant conjecturing fantine with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death had raised herself to her knees in bed with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains and was listening all at once she cried 
 you are speaking of m madeleine 
 why are you talking so low what is he doing 
 why does he not come 
 her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man they wheeled round in affright 
 answer me cried fantine 
 the servant stammered 
 the portress told me that he could not come 
 be calm my child said the sister lie down again 
 fantine without changing her attitude continued in a loud voice and with an accent that was both imperious and 
 he cannot come 
 why not 
 you know the reason 
 you are whispering it to each other there 
 i want to know it 
 the hastened to say in the ear say that he is busy with the city council 
 sister simplice blushed faintly for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her 
 on the other hand it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would without doubt deal her a terrible blow and that this was a serious matter in present state her flush did not last long the sister raised her calm sad eyes to fantine and said monsieur le maire has gone away 
 fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed her eyes sparkled indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face 
 gone she cried he has gone to get cosette 
 then she raised her arms to heaven and her white face became ineffable her lips moved she was praying in a low voice 
 when her prayer was finished sister she said i am willing to lie down again i will do anything you wish i was naughty just now i beg your pardon for having spoken so loud it is very wrong to talk loudly i know that well my good sister but you see i am very happy 
 the good god is good m madeleine is good just think he has gone to montfermeil to get my little cosette 
 she lay down again with the assistance helped the nun to arrange her pillow and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck and which sister simplice had given her 
 my child said the sister try to rest now and do not talk any more 
 fantine took the hand in her moist hands and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration 
 he set out this morning for paris in fact he need not even go through paris montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence do you remember how he said to me yesterday when i spoke to him of cosette soon soon 
 he wants to give me a surprise you know he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the thenardiers they cannot say anything can they they will give back cosette for they have been paid the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay do not make signs to me that i must not talk sister 
 i am extremely happy i am doing well i am not ill at all any more i am going to see cosette again i am even quite hungry it is nearly five years since i saw her last you cannot imagine how much attached one gets to children and then she will be so pretty you will see 
 if you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had 
 in the first place she will have very beautiful hands she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old like this she must be a big girl now she is seven years old she is quite a young lady i call her cosette but her name is really euphrasie stop this morning i was looking at the dust on the and i had a sort of idea come across me like that that i should see cosette again soon 
 mon dieu how wrong it is not to see children for years 
 one ought to reflect that life is not eternal oh how good m le maire is to go it is very cold it is true he had on his cloak at least he will be here will he not will be a festival day morning sister you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it what a place that montfermeil is 
 i took that journey on foot once it was very long for me but the diligences go very quickly he will be here with cosette 
 how far is it from here to montfermeil 
 the sister who had no idea of distances replied oh i think that be will be here 
 said fantine i shall see cosette you see good sister of the good god that i am no longer ill i am mad i could dance if any one wished it 
 a person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change she was all rosy now she spoke in a lively and natural voice her whole face was one smile now and then she talked she laughed softly the joy of a mother is almost infantile 
 well resumed the nun now that you are happy mind me and do not talk any more 
 fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice yes lie down again be good for you are going to have your child sister simplice is right every one here is right 
 and then without stirring without even moving her head she began to stare all about her with eyes and a joyous air and she said nothing more 
 the sister drew the curtains together again hoping that she would fall into a doze 
 between seven and eight the doctor came not hearing any sound he thought fantine was asleep entered softly and approached the bed on tiptoe he opened the curtains a little and by the light of the taper he saw big eyes gazing at him 
 she said to him she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed will she not sir 
 the doctor thought that she was delirious 
 she added 
 see there is just room 
 the doctor took sister simplice aside and she explained matters to him that m madeleine was absent for a day or two and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid who believed that the mayor had gone to montfermeil that it was possible after all that her guess was correct the doctor approved 
 he returned to bed and she went on 
 you see when she wakes up in the morning i shall be able to say good morning to her poor kitten and when i cannot sleep at night i can hear her asleep her little gentle breathing will do me good 
 give me your hand said the doctor 
 she stretched out her arm and exclaimed with a laugh 
 ah hold in truth you did not know it i am cured cosette will arrive 
 the doctor was surprised she was better the pressure on her chest had decreased her pulse had regained its strength a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor creature 
 doctor she went on did the sister tell you that m le maire has gone to get that mite of a child 
 the doctor recommended silence and that all painful emotions should be avoided he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona and in case the fever should increase again during the night a calming potion as he took his departure he said to the sister 
 she is doing better if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive with the child who knows there are crises so astounding great joy has been known to arrest maladies i know well that this is an organic disease and in an advanced state but all those things are such mysteries 
 we may be able to save her

 chapter xiii 
 
 that same night rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of detachment his hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with our campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him in front of him was misty darkness rostov could see nothing peer as he would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there was something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes his eyes kept closing and in his fancy appeared now the emperor now denisov and now moscow memories and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding and sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figures of hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness why not it might easily happen thought rostov that the emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer say go and find out there there are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself what if he gave me a place near him oh how i would guard him how i would tell him the truth how i would unmask his deceivers and in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign rostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful german whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the emperor suddenly a distant shout aroused him he started and opened his eyes 
 where am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and watchword shaft olmutz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow he thought ask leave to go to the front this may be my only chance of seeing the emperor it be long now before i am off duty take another turn and when i get back go to the general and ask him he readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars it seemed to him that it was getting lighter to the left he saw a sloping descent lit up and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall on this knoll there was a white patch that rostov could not at all make out was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon or some unmelted snow or some white houses he even thought something moved on that white spot i expect snow that spot a spot une tache he thought there now not a tache natasha sister black eyes na tasha she be surprised when i tell her how seen the emperor natasha take my sabretache keep to the right your honor there are bushes here came the voice of an hussar past whom rostov was riding in the act of falling asleep rostov lifted his head that had sunk almost to his mane and pulled up beside the hussar he was succumbing to irresistible youthful childish drowsiness but what was i thinking i forget how shall i speak to the emperor no not it tomorrow oh yes natasha sabretache saber the hussars ah the hussars with mustaches along the tverskaya street rode the hussar with mustaches i thought about him too just opposite house old guryev oh but a fine fellow but all nonsense the chief thing is that the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to say something but dared not no it was i who dared not but nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important thing i was thinking of yes sabretache oh yes yes right and his head once more sank to his neck all at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at what what what cut them down what said rostov waking up at the moment he opened his eyes his eyes he heard in front of him where the enemy was the shouts of thousands of voices his horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts over there where the shouting came from a fire flared up and went out again then another and all along the french line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder rostov could hear the sound of french words but could not distinguish them the din of many voices was too great all he could hear was ahahah and rrrr 
 that what do you make of it said rostov to the hussar beside him that must be the camp 
 the hussar did not reply 
 why you hear it rostov asked again after waiting for a reply 
 who can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantly 
 from the direction it must be the enemy repeated rostov 
 it may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar dark steady he cried to his fidgeting horse 
 horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce the lights spread farther and farther probably along the line of the french camp rostov no longer wanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him vive he now heard distinctly 
 they be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to the hussar beside him 
 the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the sound of hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared looming huge as an elephant 
 your honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rostov 
 rostov still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line one was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the camp rostov rode up to bagration reported to him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying 
 believe me said prince dolgorukov addressing bagration it is nothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us 
 hardly said bagration i saw them this evening on that knoll if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too officer said bagration to rostov are the skirmishers still there 
 they were there this evening but now i know your excellency shall i go with some of my hussars to see replied rostov 
 bagration stopped and before replying tried to see face in the mist 
 well go and see he said after a pause 
 yes sir 
 rostov spurred his horse called to sergeant fedchenko and two other hussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream but rostov pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes having descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or the fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudly and distinctly in the valley he saw before him something like a river but when he reached it he found it was a road having come out onto the road he reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside to keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it follow me said he crossed the road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the french pickets had been standing that evening 
 your honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him and before rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a report and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan rostov turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followed at intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones rostov reined in his horse whose spirits had risen like his own at the firing and went back at a footpace well some more some more a merry voice was saying in his soul but no more shots came 
 only when approaching bagration did rostov let his horse gallop again and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general 
 dolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us 
 what does that prove he was saying as rostov rode up they might retreat and leave the pickets 
 plain that they have not all gone yet prince said bagration wait till tomorrow morning find out everything tomorrow 
 the picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was in the evening reported rostov stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets 
 very good very good said bagration thank you officer 
 your excellency said rostov may i ask a favor 
 what is it 
 tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attached to the first squadron 
 your name 
 count rostov 
 oh very well you may stay in attendance on me 
 count ilya son asked dolgorukov 
 but rostov did not reply 
 then i may reckon on it your excellency 
 i will give the order 
 tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperor thought rostov 
 thank god 
 the fires and shouting in the army were occasioned by the fact that while proclamation was being read to the troops the emperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing him lit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting vive proclamation was as follows 
 soldiers the russian army is advancing against you to avenge the austrian army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke at hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place the position we occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself direct your battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the ranks but should victory be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no doubt of victory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nation 
 do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where fresh french troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peace i shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myself

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the jumper 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the flea the grasshopper and the skipjack once wanted to see 
 which of them could jump highest and they invited the whole world 
 and whoever else would come to see the grand sight and there the 
 three famous jumpers were met together in the room 
 
 yes give my daughter to him who jumps highest said the 
 king for it would be mean to let these people jump for nothing 
 the flea stepped out first he had very pretty manners and 
 bowed in all directions for he had young ladies blood in his 
 veins and was accustomed to consort only with human beings and 
 that was of great consequence 
 
 then came the grasshopper he was certainly much heavier but he 
 had a good figure and wore the green uniform that was born with 
 him this person moreover maintained that he belonged to a very 
 old family in the land of egypt and that he was highly esteemed 
 there he had just come from the field he said and had been put into 
 a card house three stories high and all made of picture cards with 
 the figures turned inwards there were doors and windows in the house cut in the body of the queen of hearts 
 
 i sing so he said that sixteen native crickets who have 
 chirped from their youth up and have never yet had a card house of 
 their own would become thinner than they are with envy if they were 
 to hear me 
 
 both of them the flea and the grasshopper took care to 
 announce who they were and that they considered themselves entitled 
 to marry a princess 
 
 the skipjack said nothing but it was said of him that he thought all the more and directly the yard dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the skipjack was of good family and formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose 
 the old councillor who had received three medals for holding his tongue declared that the skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one and more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac 
 
 i shall not say anything more said the old king i only go 
 on quietly and always think the best 
 
 now they were to take their jump the flea sprang so high that 
 no one could see him and then they asserted that he had not jumped at all that was very mean the grasshopper only sprang half as high but he sprang straight into the face and the king declared that 
 was horribly rude the skipjack stood a long time considering at last 
 people thought that he could not jump at all 
 
 i only hope not become unwell said the yard dog and 
 then he smelt at him again 
 
 tap he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap of 
 the princess who sat on a low golden stool 
 
 then the king said the highest leap was taken by him who 
 jumped up to my daughter for therein lies the point but it 
 requires head to achieve that and the skipjack has shown that he 
 has a head 
 
 and so he had the princess 
 
 i jumped highest after all said the flea but all the 
 same let her have the with its lump of wax and bit of 
 stick i jumped to the highest but in this world a body is required 
 if one wishes to be seen 
 
 and the flea went into foreign military service where it is 
 said he was killed 
 
 the grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch and thought and 
 considered how things happened in the world and he too said body is required body is required and then he sang his own melancholy song and from that we have gathered this story which they say is not true though in print 
 
 the end

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the jumper 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the flea the grasshopper and the skipjack once wanted to see 
 which of them could jump highest and they invited the whole world 
 and whoever else would come to see the grand sight and there the 
 three famous jumpers were met together in the room 
 
 yes give my daughter to him who jumps highest said the 
 king for it would be mean to let these people jump for nothing 
 the flea stepped out first he had very pretty manners and 
 bowed in all directions for he had young ladies blood in his 
 veins and was accustomed to consort only with human beings and 
 that was of great consequence 
 
 then came the grasshopper he was certainly much heavier but he 
 had a good figure and wore the green uniform that was born with 
 him this person moreover maintained that he belonged to a very 
 old family in the land of egypt and that he was highly esteemed 
 there he had just come from the field he said and had been put into 
 a card house three stories high and all made of picture cards with 
 the figures turned inwards there were doors and windows in the house cut in the body of the queen of hearts 
 
 i sing so he said that sixteen native crickets who have 
 chirped from their youth up and have never yet had a card house of 
 their own would become thinner than they are with envy if they were 
 to hear me 
 
 both of them the flea and the grasshopper took care to 
 announce who they were and that they considered themselves entitled 
 to marry a princess 
 
 the skipjack said nothing but it was said of him that he thought all the more and directly the yard dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the skipjack was of good family and formed from the breastbone of an undoubted goose 
 the old councillor who had received three medals for holding his tongue declared that the skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one and more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac 
 
 i shall not say anything more said the old king i only go 
 on quietly and always think the best 
 
 now they were to take their jump the flea sprang so high that 
 no one could see him and then they asserted that he had not jumped at all that was very mean the grasshopper only sprang half as high but he sprang straight into the face and the king declared that 
 was horribly rude the skipjack stood a long time considering at last 
 people thought that he could not jump at all 
 
 i only hope not become unwell said the yard dog and 
 then he smelt at him again 
 
 tap he sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap of 
 the princess who sat on a low golden stool 
 
 then the king said the highest leap was taken by him who 
 jumped up to my daughter for therein lies the point but it 
 requires head to achieve that and the skipjack has shown that he 
 has a head 
 
 and so he had the princess 
 
 i jumped highest after all said the flea but all the 
 same let her have the with its lump of wax and bit of 
 stick i jumped to the highest but in this world a body is required 
 if one wishes to be seen 
 
 and the flea went into foreign military service where it is 
 said he was killed 
 
 the grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch and thought and 
 considered how things happened in the world and he too said body is required body is required and then he sang his own melancholy song and from that we have gathered this story which they say is not true though in print

 chapter vii 
 
 the traveller on his arrival takes precautions for departure 
 it was nearly eight in the evening when the cart which we left on the road entered the of the hotel de la poste in arras the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn sent back the extra horse and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable then he opened the door of a which was situated on the ground floor sat down there and leaned his elbows on a table he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault but at bottom he was not sorry 
 the landlady of the hotel entered 
 does monsieur wish a bed 
 does monsieur require supper 
 he made a sign of the head in the negative 
 the stableman says that horse is extremely fatigued 
 here he broke his silence 
 will not the horse be in a condition to set out again morning 
 oh monsieur he must rest for two days at least 
 he inquired 
 is not the located here 
 yes sir 
 the hostess conducted him to the office he showed his passport and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to m sur m by the the seat beside the chanced to be vacant he engaged it and paid for it 
 monsieur said the clerk do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one in the morning 
 this done he left the hotel and began to wander about the town 
 he was not acquainted with arras the streets were dark and he walked on at random but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the he crossed the little river crinchon and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way a citizen was passing along with a lantern 
 after some hesitation he decided to apply to this man not without having first glanced behind and in front of him as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put 
 monsieur said he where is the if you please 
 you do not belong in town sir replied the bourgeois who was an oldish man well follow me 
 i happen to be going in the direction of the that is to say in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture for the is undergoing repairs just at this moment and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture 
 is it there that the assizes are held he asked 
 certainly sir you see the prefecture of was the palace before the revolution 
 m de conzie who was bishop in built a grand hall there 
 it is in this grand hall that the court is held 
 on the way the bourgeois said to him 
 if monsieur desires to witness a case it is rather late the sittings generally close at six 
 when they arrived on the grand square however the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up in the front of a vast and gloomy building 
 upon my word sir you are in luck you have arrived in season do you see those four windows 
 that is the court of assizes there is light there so they are not through 
 the matter must have been greatly protracted and they are holding an evening session do you take an interest in this affair 
 is it a criminal case are you a witness 
 he replied 
 i have not come on any business i only wish to speak to one of the lawyers 
 that is different said the bourgeois 
 stop sir here is the door where the sentry stands 
 you have only to ascend the grand staircase 
 he conformed to the directions and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people and where groups intermingled with lawyers in their gowns were whispering together here and there 
 it is always a thing to see these congregations of men robed in black murmuring together in low voices on the threshold of the halls of justice 
 it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words 
 condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result 
 all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices 
 this spacious hall illuminated by a single lamp was the old hall of the episcopal palace and served as the large hall of the palace of justice 
 a door which was closed at that moment separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting 
 the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met 
 what stage have they reached sir he asked 
 it is finished said the lawyer 
 finished 
 this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round 
 excuse me sir perhaps you are a relative 
 no i know no one here 
 has judgment been pronounced 
 of course 
 nothing else was possible 
 to penal servitude 
 for life 
 he continued in a voice so weak that it was barely audible 
 then his identity was established 
 what identity replied the lawyer 
 there was no identity to be established 
 the matter was very simple 
 the woman had murdered her child the infanticide was proved the jury threw out the question of premeditation and she was condemned for life 
 so it was a woman said he 
 why certainly 
 the limosin woman 
 of what are you speaking 
 nothing 
 but since it is all over how comes it that the hall is still lighted 
 for another case which was begun about two hours ago 
 what other case 
 oh this one is a clear case also 
 it is about a sort of blackguard a man arrested for a second offence a convict who has been guilty of theft 
 i know his name exactly 
 a phiz for you 
 send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone 
 is there any way of getting into the sir said he 
 i really think that there is not 
 there is a great crowd however the hearing has been suspended 
 some people have gone out and when the hearing is resumed you might make an effort 
 where is the entrance 
 through yonder large door 
 the lawyer left him 
 in the course of a few moments he had experienced almost simultaneously almost intermingled with each other all possible emotions 
 the words of this indifferent spectator had in turn pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire when he saw that nothing was settled he breathed freely once more but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure 
 he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying the docket of the session was very heavy the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases 
 they had begun with the infanticide and now they had reached the convict the old offender the return horse 
 this man had stolen apples but that did not appear to be entirely proved what had been proved was that he had already been in the galleys at toulon it was that which lent a bad aspect to his case 
 however the examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed but the plea and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come it could not be finished before midnight 
 the man would probably be condemned the was very clever and never missed his culprits he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses 
 an usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the assizes he inquired of this usher 
 will the door be opened soon sir 
 it will not be opened at all replied the usher 
 what 
 it will not be opened when the hearing is resumed is not the hearing suspended 
 the hearing has just been begun again replied the usher but the door will not be opened again 
 why 
 because the hall is full 
 what 
 there is not room for one more 
 not another one 
 the door is closed 
 no one can enter now 
 the usher added after a pause 
 there are to tell the truth two or three extra places behind monsieur le president but monsieur le president only admits public functionaries to them 
 so saying the usher turned his back 
 he retired with bowed head traversed the antechamber and slowly descended the stairs as though hesitating at every step it is probable that he was holding counsel with himself the violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended and every moment he encountered some new phase of it 
 on reaching the he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms 
 all at once he opened his coat drew out his took from it a pencil tore out a leaf and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly by the light of the street lantern this line 
 m madeleine mayor of m sur m then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides made his way through the crowd walked straight up to the usher handed him the paper and said in an authoritative manner

 chapter xiv 
 
 at five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of the center the reserves and right flank had not yet moved but on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan were already up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which they were throwing everything superfluous made the eyes smart it was cold and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting the soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guides were moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds of the advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near a commanding quarters the regiment began to move the soldiers ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags into the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the officers buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and moved along the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave final instructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going 
 a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whatever strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship so the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the same sergeant major ivan mitrich the same company dog jack and the same commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing but on the day of battle heaven knows how and whence a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them 
 the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced for a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills avoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers became aware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columns were moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were going too 
 there now the kurskies have also gone past was being said in the ranks 
 wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last night i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regular moscow 
 though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troops marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to an attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly and irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army been alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but as it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters 
 why have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up against the french 
 no one hear them be firing if we had 
 they were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason all those damned germans muddling what stupid devils 
 yes send them on in front but no fear crowding up behind and now here we stand hungry 
 i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the way said an officer 
 ah those damned germans they know their own country said another 
 what division are you shouted an adjutant riding up 
 the eighteenth 
 then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you get there till evening 
 what stupid orders they themselves know what they are doing said the officer and rode off 
 then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russian 
 but what jabbering no one can make out said a soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away shoot them the scoundrels 
 we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we got halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides 
 and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the germans 
 the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry who had to wait 
 at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after an delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they were descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another at first irregularly at varying intervals trata tat and then more and more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream began 
 not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the action began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into the valley the fourth column with which kutuzov was stood on the pratzen heights 
 below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one knew till after eight 
 it was nine in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea down below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with his marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clear blue sky and the vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french army and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab horse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley not a single muscle of his face which in those days was still thin moved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot his predictions were being justified part of the russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist from information he had received the evening before from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted the center of the russian army and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not begin the engagement 
 today was a great day for him the anniversary of his coronation before dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he sat motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his cold face wore that special look of confident happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun floating up out of the mist 
 when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light as if he had only awaited this to begin the action he drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and a few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by russian troops moving down the valley to their left

 i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the way said an officer 
 ah those damned germans they know their own country said another 
 what division are you shouted an adjutant riding up 
 the eighteenth 
 then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you get there till evening 
 what stupid orders they themselves know what they are doing said the officer and rode off 
 then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russian 
 but what jabbering no one can make out said a soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away shoot them the scoundrels 
 we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we got halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides 
 and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the germans 
 the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry who had to wait 
 at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after an delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they were descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another at first irregularly at varying intervals trata tat and then more and more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream began 
 not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the action began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into the valley the fourth column with which kutuzov was stood on the pratzen heights 
 below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one knew till after eight 
 it was nine in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea down below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with his marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clear blue sky and the vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french army and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab horse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley not a single muscle of his face which in those days was still thin moved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot his predictions were being justified part of the russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist from information he had received the evening before from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted the center of the russian army and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not begin the engagement 
 today was a great day for him the anniversary of his coronation before dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he sat motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his cold face wore that special look of confident happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun floating up out of the mist 
 when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light as if he had only awaited this to begin the action he drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and a few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by russian troops moving down the valley to their left

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the last dream of the old oak 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the forest high up on the steep shore and not far from the 
 open seacoast stood a very old it was just three hundred 
 and years old but that long time was to the tree as the 
 same number of days might be to us we wake by day and sleep by night and then we have our dreams it is different with the tree it is 
 obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year and does 
 not get any sleep till winter comes winter is its time for rest its night after the long day of spring summer and autumn on many a warm summer the ephemera the flies that exist for only a day had fluttered about the old oak enjoyed life and felt happy and if for a moment one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves the tree would always say poor little creature your whole life consists only of a single day how very short it must be quite melancholy 
 
 melancholy what do you mean the little creature would always 
 reply everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm and 
 beautiful that it makes me joyous 
 
 but only for one day and then it is all over 
 
 over repeated the fly what is the meaning of all over are 
 you all over too 
 
 no i shall very likely live for thousands of your days and my 
 day is whole seasons long indeed it is so long that you could never 
 reckon it out 
 
 no then i understand you you may have thousands of my 
 days but i have thousands of moments in which i can be merry and 
 happy does all the beauty of the world cease when you die 
 
 no replied the tree it will certainly last much longer 
 infinitely longer than i can even think of well then said the 
 little fly we have the same time to live only we reckon 
 differently and the little creature danced and floated in the air 
 rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet rejoicing in 
 the balmy breezes laden with the fragrance of and 
 wild roses and honeysuckle from the garden hedges 
 wild thyme primroses and mint and the scent of all these was so 
 strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly the long 
 and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights that 
 when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and 
 enjoyment its wings could sustain it no longer and gently and slowly 
 it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass nodded its little 
 head as well as it could nod and slept peacefully and sweetly the 
 fly was dead 
 
 poor little ephemera said the oak what a terribly short 
 life and so on every summer day the dance was repeated the same 
 questions asked and the same answers given the same thing was 
 continued through many generations of ephemera all of them felt 
 equally merry and equally happy 
 
 the oak remained awake through the morning of spring the noon 
 of summer and the evening of autumn its time of rest its night drew 
 nigh winter was coming already the storms were singing here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf we will rock you and lull you go to sleep go to sleep we will sing you to sleep and shake you to sleep and it will do your old twigs good they will even crackle with pleasure sleep sweetly sleep sweetly it is your 
 night correctly speaking you are but a 
 youngster in the world sleep sweetly the clouds will drop snow 
 upon you which will be quite a warm and sheltering to your 
 feet sweet sleep to you and pleasant dreams and there stood the 
 oak stripped of all its leaves left to rest during the whole of a 
 long winter and to dream many dreams of events that had happened in its life as in the dreams of men the great tree had once been small indeed in its cradle it had been an acorn according to human 
 computation it was now in the fourth century of its existence it was 
 the largest and best tree in the forest its summit towered above 
 all the other trees and could be seen far out at sea so that it 
 served as a landmark to the sailors it had no idea how many eyes 
 looked eagerly for it in its topmost branches the built 
 her nest and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances and his notes echoed amid the boughs and in autumn when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates the birds of passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight across the sea but now it was winter the tree stood leafless so that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches that sprang forth from the trunk crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them and talked of the hard times which were beginning and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food 
 
 it was just about holy christmas time that the tree dreamed a 
 dream the tree had doubtless a kind of feeling that the festive 
 time had arrived and in his dream fancied he heard the bells 
 ringing from all the churches round and yet it seemed to him to be 
 a beautiful day mild and warm his mighty summits was 
 crowned with spreading fresh green foliage the sunbeams played 
 among the leaves and branches and the air was full of fragrance 
 from herb and blossom painted butterflies chased each other the 
 summer flies danced around him as if the world had been created 
 merely for them to dance and be merry in all that had happened to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him as in 
 a festive procession he saw the knights of olden times and noble 
 ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds with plumes 
 waving in their hats and falcons on their wrists the hunting horn 
 sounded and the dogs barked he saw hostile warriors in colored 
 dresses and glittering armor with spear and halberd pitching their 
 tents and anon striking them the watchfires again blazed and men 
 sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree he saw lovers 
 meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine and carve the 
 initials of their names in the bark on his trunk 
 
 once but long years had intervened since then guitars and eolian 
 harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers now they seemed to hang there again and he could hear their marvellous tones 
 the cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree and 
 the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every 
 fibre of root and stem and leaf rising even to the highest 
 branches the tree felt itself stretching and spreading out while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life as he 
 grew higher and still higher with increased strength his topmost 
 boughs became broader and fuller and in proportion to his growth 
 so was his increased and with it arose a joyous 
 longing to grow higher and higher to reach even to the warm bright 
 sun itself already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage or large white swans every leaf seemed gifted with sight as if it possessed eyes to see the stars became visible in broad daylight large and 
 sparkling like clear and gentle eyes they recalled to the memory the 
 look in the eyes of a child or in the eyes of lovers who 
 had once met beneath the branches of the old oak these were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree full of peace and joy and yet amidst all this happiness the tree felt a yearning longing desire that all the other trees bushes herbs and flowers beneath him 
 might be able also to rise higher as he had done and to see all this 
 splendor and experience the same happiness the grand majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment while all 
 the rest both great and small were not with him and this feeling of 
 yearning trembled through every branch through every leaf as 
 warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human 
 heart the summit of the tree waved to and fro and bent downwards 
 as if in his silent longing he sought for something then there came 
 to him the fragrance of thyme followed by the more powerful scent 
 of honeysuckle and violets and he fancied he heard the note of the 
 cuckoo at length his longing was satisfied up through the clouds 
 came the green summits of the forest trees and beneath him the oak 
 saw them rising and growing higher and higher bush and herb shot 
 upward and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise more 
 quickly the was the quickest of all like a lightning 
 flash the slender stem shot upwards in a zigzag line the branches 
 spreading around it like green gauze and banners every native of 
 the wood even to the brown and feathery rushes grew with the rest 
 while the birds ascended with the melody of song on a blade of grass that fluttered in the air like a long green ribbon sat a 
 grasshopper cleaning his wings with his legs may beetles hummed the bees murmured the birds sang each in his own way the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness 
 
 but where is the little blue flower that grows by the water 
 asked the oak and the purple and the daisy you see 
 the oak wanted to have them all with him 
 
 here we are we are here sounded in voice and song 
 but the beautiful thyme of last summer where is that and the 
 which last year covered the earth with their 
 bloom and the wild with its lovely blossoms and all the 
 glory of the wood which has flourished year after year even what may have but now sprouted forth could be with us here 
 
 we are here we are here sounded voices higher in the air as 
 if they had flown there beforehand 
 
 why this is beautiful too beautiful to be believed said the 
 oak in a joyful tone i have them all here both great and small not 
 one has been forgotten can such happiness be imagined it seemed 
 almost impossible 
 
 in heaven with the eternal god it can be imagined and it is 
 possible sounded the reply through the air 
 
 and the old tree as it still grew upwards and onwards felt 
 that his roots were loosening themselves from the earth 
 
 it is right so it is best said the tree no fetters hold me 
 now i can fly up to the very highest point in light and glory and 
 all i love are with me both small and great all all are here 
 
 such was the dream of the old oak and while he dreamed a 
 mighty storm came rushing over land and sea at the holy christmas 
 time the sea rolled in great billows towards the shore there was a 
 cracking and crushing heard in the tree the root was torn from the 
 ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was being 
 loosened from the earth he fell his three hundred and 
 years were passed as the single day of the ephemera on the morning of when the sun rose the storm had ceased from all the churches sounded the festive bells and from every hearth even of the smallest hut rose the smoke into the blue sky like the smoke from the festive on the druids altars the sea gradually became calm and on board a great ship that had withstood the tempest during the night all the flags were displayed as a token 
 of joy and festivity the tree is down the old oak our landmark on the coast exclaimed the sailors it must have fallen in the storm 
 of last night who can replace it alas no one this was a funeral 
 oration over the old tree short but there it lay 
 stretched on the shore and over it sounded the notes 
 of a song from the ship a song of christmas joy and of the 
 redemption of the soul of man and of eternal life through 
 atoning blood 
 sing aloud on the happy morn 
 all is fulfilled for christ is born 
 with songs of joy let us loudly sing 
 hallelujahs to christ our king 
 thus sounded the old christmas carol and every one on board the 
 ship felt his thoughts elevated through the song and the prayer even 
 as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last its beautiful dream on 
 that christmas morn

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter viii 
 
 an entrance by favor 
 although he did not suspect the fact the mayor of m sur m enjoyed a sort of celebrity 
 for the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of bas boulonnais it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments 
 besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of m sur m which was not indebted to him for some benefit 
 he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements 
 it was thus that he had when occasion offered supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne the industry at frevent and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at everywhere the name of m madeleine was pronounced with veneration arras and douai envied the happy little town of m sur m its mayor 
 the councillor of the royal court of douai who was presiding over this session of the assizes at arras was acquainted in common with the rest of the world with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored 
 when the usher discreetly opening the door which connected the with the bent over the back of the and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused adding 
 the gentleman desires to be present at the trial the president with a quick and deferential movement seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher saying admit him 
 the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him 
 in the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him will monsieur do me the honor to follow me it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously and who was now bowing to the earth before him at the same time the usher handed him the paper 
 he unfolded it and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it 
 the president of the court of assizes presents his respects to m madeleine 
 he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste 
 he followed the usher 
 a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet of severe aspect lighted by two wax candles placed upon a table with a green cloth 
 the last words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ears 
 monsieur you are now in the you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door and you will find yourself in the behind the chair these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed 
 the usher had left him alone 
 the supreme moment had arrived he sought to collect his faculties but could not 
 it is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life that the threads of thought snap within the brain 
 he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned 
 with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where so many lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his name and which his fate was at that moment traversing 
 he stared at the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he 
 he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the jolts of the cart but he was not conscious of it it seemed to him that he felt nothing 
 he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicolas pache mayor of paris and minister and dated through an error no doubt the th of june of the year ii and in which pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them 
 any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment and who had watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and he read it two or three times he read it without paying any attention to it and unconsciously he was thinking of fantine and cosette 
 as he dreamed he turned round and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes he had almost forgotten that door 
 his glance calm at first paused there remained fixed on that brass handle then grew terrified and little by little became impregnated with fear 
 beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples 
 at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which does so well convey pardieu who compels me to this then he wheeled briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him went to it opened it and passed out he was no longer in that chamber he was outside in a corridor a long narrow corridor broken by steps and gratings making all sorts of angles lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids the corridor through which he had approached he breathed he listened not a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as though pursued 
 when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listened the same silence reigned and there was the same darkness around him he was out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall the stone was cold the perspiration lay on his brow he straightened himself up with a shiver 
 then there alone in the darkness trembling with cold and with something else too perchance he meditated 
 he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard within him but one voice which said alas 
 a quarter of an hour passed thus

 an entrance by favor 
 although he did not suspect the fact the mayor of m sur m enjoyed a sort of celebrity 
 for the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of bas boulonnais it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments 
 besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of m sur m which was not indebted to him for some benefit 
 he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements 
 it was thus that he had when occasion offered supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne the industry at frevent and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at everywhere the name of m madeleine was pronounced with veneration arras and douai envied the happy little town of m sur m its mayor 
 the councillor of the royal court of douai who was presiding over this session of the assizes at arras was acquainted in common with the rest of the world with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored 
 when the usher discreetly opening the door which connected the with the bent over the back of the and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused adding 
 the gentleman desires to be present at the trial the president with a quick and deferential movement seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher saying admit him 
 the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him 
 in the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him will monsieur do me the honor to follow me it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously and who was now bowing to the earth before him at the same time the usher handed him the paper 
 he unfolded it and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it 
 the president of the court of assizes presents his respects to m madeleine 
 he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste 
 he followed the usher 
 a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet of severe aspect lighted by two wax candles placed upon a table with a green cloth 
 the last words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ears 
 monsieur you are now in the you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door and you will find yourself in the behind the chair these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed 
 the usher had left him alone 
 the supreme moment had arrived he sought to collect his faculties but could not 
 it is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life that the threads of thought snap within the brain 
 he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned 
 with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where so many lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his name and which his fate was at that moment traversing 
 he stared at the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he 
 he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the jolts of the cart but he was not conscious of it it seemed to him that he felt nothing 
 he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicolas pache mayor of paris and minister and dated through an error no doubt the th of june of the year ii and in which pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them 
 any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment and who had watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and he read it two or three times he read it without paying any attention to it and unconsciously he was thinking of fantine and cosette 
 as he dreamed he turned round and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes he had almost forgotten that door 
 his glance calm at first paused there remained fixed on that brass handle then grew terrified and little by little became impregnated with fear 
 beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples 
 at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which does so well convey pardieu who compels me to this then he wheeled briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him went to it opened it and passed out he was no longer in that chamber he was outside in a corridor a long narrow corridor broken by steps and gratings making all sorts of angles lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids the corridor through which he had approached he breathed he listened not a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as though pursued 
 when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listened the same silence reigned and there was the same darkness around him he was out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall the stone was cold the perspiration lay on his brow he straightened himself up with a shiver 
 then there alone in the darkness trembling with cold and with something else too perchance he meditated 
 he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard within him but one voice which said alas 
 a quarter of an hour passed thus 
 at length he bowed his head sighed with agony dropped his arms and retraced his steps he walked slowly and as though crushed 
 it seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back 
 he the the first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door 
 this knob which was round and of polished brass shone like a terrible star for him he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger 
 he could not take his eyes from it 
 from time to time he advanced a step and approached the door 
 had he listened he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur but he did not listen and he did not hear

 at eight kutuzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth column the one that was to take the place of and columns which had already gone down into the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he halted prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming the commander in suite he was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day of his toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did not know but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army his own strategic plan which obviously could not now be carried out was forgotten now entering into plan prince andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision 
 to the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight would concentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there thought he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there standard in hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me 
 he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions seeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with which i shall lead the army 
 in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like a sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb of the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably was for something could be descried on the right the guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist in front and behind moved infantry the commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutuzov seemed worn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being given apparently obstructed by something in front 
 do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village he said angrily to a general who had ridden up you understand your excellency my dear sir that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy 
 i intended to them beyond the village your excellency answered the general 
 kutuzov laughed bitterly 
 make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy very fine 
 the enemy is still far away your excellency according to the dispositions 
 the dispositions exclaimed kutuzov bitterly who told you that kindly do as you are ordered 
 yes sir 
 my dear fellow nesvitski whispered to prince andrew the old man is as surly as a dog 
 an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to kutuzov and asked in the name had the fourth column advanced into action 
 kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon prince andrew who was beside him seeing him malevolent and caustic expression softened as if admitting that what was being done was not his fault and still not answering the austrian adjutant he addressed bolkonski 
 go my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed the village tell it to stop and await my orders 
 hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him 
 and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added what are they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still not replying to the austrian 
 prince andrew galloped off to execute the order 
 overtaking the battalions that continued to advance he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in order to throw out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away there was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist having given orders in the commander in name to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kutuzov still in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes the troops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their muskets on the ground 
 all right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to a general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all the columns had already descended 
 plenty of time your excellency muttered kutuzov in the midst of a yawn plenty of time he repeated 
 just then at a distance behind kutuzov was heard the sound of regiments saluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in front of which kutuzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown along the road from pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of them rode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperors followed by their suites kutuzov affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front gave the command attention and rode up to the emperors with a salute his whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struck alexander unpleasantly he rode up and saluted 
 this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished after his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of olmutz where bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth 
 at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two miles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartoryski novosiltsev prince volkonsky strogonov and the others all richly dressed gay young men on splendid fresh only slightly heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the emperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat very erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question most likely he is asking at what they started thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at brunn in the emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the guard and line regiments russian and austrian among them were grooms leading the beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths 
 as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of success reached cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men 
 why you beginning michael ilarionovich said the emperor alexander hurriedly to kutuzov glancing courteously at the same time at the emperor francis 
 i am waiting your majesty answered kutuzov bending forward respectfully 
 the emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard 
 waiting your majesty repeated kutuzov prince andrew noted that upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waiting not all the columns have formed up yet your majesty 
 the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was near him as if complaining of kutuzov 
 you know michael ilarionovich we are not are not on the empress field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said the tsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the emperor francis continued to look about him and did not listen 
 that is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in a resounding voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard and again something in his face twitched that is just why i do not begin sire because we are not on parade and not on the empress field said clearly and distinctly 
 in the suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not he certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say 
 the tsar looked intently and observantly into eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more but kutuzov with respectfully bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for about a minute 
 however if you command it your majesty said kutuzov lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but submissive general 
 he touched his horse and having called miloradovich the commander of the column gave him the order to advance 
 the troops again began to move and two battalions of the novgorod and one of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperor 
 as this apsheron battalion marched by the miloradovich without his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the emperor 
 god be with you general said the emperor 
 ma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite sire he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the suite by his poor french 
 indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to do sire 
 miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the emperor the apsheron men excited by the presence passed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold brisk pace 
 lads shouted miloradovich in a loud and cheery voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of battle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons his comrades in time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that he forgot the sovereigns presence lads not the first village had to take cried he 
 glad to do our best shouted the soldiers 
 the horse started at the sudden cry this horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the empress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that was being said thought and felt that day by its rider 
 the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him pointing to the gallant apsherons

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the last pearl 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we are in a rich happy house where the master the servants the 
 friends of the family are full of joy and felicity for on this day 
 a son and heir has been born and mother and child are doing well 
 the lamp in the had been partly shaded and the windows were covered with heavy curtains of some costly silken material the carpet was thick and soft like a covering of moss everything invited to slumber everything had a charming look of repose and so the nurse had discovered for she slept and well she might sleep while everything around her told of happiness and blessing the guardian angel of the house leaned against the head of the bed while over the child was spread as t were a net of shining stars and each star was a pearl of happiness all the good stars of life had brought their gifts to the newly born here sparkled health wealth fortune and love in short there seemed to be everything for which man could wish on earth 
 
 everything has been bestowed here said the guardian angel 
 no not everything said a voice near him the voice of the good 
 angel of the child one fairy has not yet brought her gift but she 
 will even if years should elapse she will bring her gift it is 
 the last pearl that is wanting 
 
 wanting cried the guardian angel nothing must be wanting 
 here and if it is so let us fetch it let us seek the powerful 
 fairy let us go to her 
 
 she will come she will come some day unsought 
 her pearl must not be missing it must be there that the 
 crown when worn may be complete where is she to be found 
 where does she dwell said the guardian angel tell me and i will procure the pearl 
 
 will you do that replied the good angel of the child then i 
 will lead you to her directly wherever she may be she has no abiding 
 place she rules in the palace of the emperor sometimes she enters 
 the humble cot she passes no one without leaving a trace of 
 her presence she brings her gift with her whether it is a world or a 
 bauble to this child she must come you think that to wait for this 
 time would be long and useless well then let us go for this 
 pearl the only one lacking amidst all this wealth 
 
 then they floated away to the spot where the fairy 
 was now lingering it was in a large house with dark windows and empty rooms in which a peculiar stillness reigned a whole row of windows stood open so that the rude wind could enter at its pleasure and the long white curtains waved to and fro in the current of air in the centre of one of the rooms stood an open coffin in which lay the body of a woman still in the bloom of youth and very beautiful fresh roses were scattered over her the delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the solemn earnest look which spoke of an entrance into a better world were alone visible around the coffin stood the husband and children a whole troop the youngest in the arms they were come to take a last farewell look of their mother the husband kissed her hand which now lay like a withered leaf but which a short time before had been diligently employed in deeds of love for them all tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks and fell in heavy drops on the floor but not a word was spoken the silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief 
 
 with silent steps still sobbing they left the room a burning 
 light remained in the room and a long red wick rose far above the 
 flame which fluttered in the draught of air strange men came in 
 and placed the lid of the coffin over the dead and drove the nails 
 firmly in while the blows of the hammer resounded through the 
 house and echoed in the hearts that were bleeding 
 
 whither art thou leading me asked the guardian angel here 
 dwells no fairy whose pearl could be counted amongst the best gifts of life 
 
 yes she is here here in this sacred hour replied the angel 
 pointing to a corner of the room and there where in her 
 the mother had taken her seat amidst flowers and 
 pictures in that spot where she like the blessed fairy of the 
 house had welcomed husband children and friends and like a 
 sunbeam had spread joy and cheerfulness around her the centre and 
 heart of them all there in that very spot sat a strange woman 
 clothed in long flowing garments and occupying the place of the dead wife and mother it was the fairy and her name was sorrow 
 a hot tear rolled into her lap and formed itself into a pearl glowing with all the colors of the rainbow the angel seized it the pearl 
 glittered like a star with radiance the pearl of sorrow 
 the last which must not be wanting increases the lustre and 
 explains the meaning of all the other pearls 
 
 do you see the shimmer of the rainbow which unites earth to 
 heaven so has there been a bridge built between this world and the 
 next through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the 
 stars to the end of all things then we glance at the pearl of sorrow 
 in which are concealed the wings which shall carry us away to 
 eternal happiness

 will lead you to her directly wherever she may be she has no abiding 
 place she rules in the palace of the emperor sometimes she enters 
 the humble cot she passes no one without leaving a trace of 
 her presence she brings her gift with her whether it is a world or a 
 bauble to this child she must come you think that to wait for this 
 time would be long and useless well then let us go for this 
 pearl the only one lacking amidst all this wealth 
 
 then they floated away to the spot where the fairy 
 was now lingering it was in a large house with dark windows and empty rooms in which a peculiar stillness reigned a whole row of windows stood open so that the rude wind could enter at its pleasure and the long white curtains waved to and fro in the current of air in the centre of one of the rooms stood an open coffin in which lay the body of a woman still in the bloom of youth and very beautiful fresh roses were scattered over her the delicate folded hands and the noble face glorified in death by the solemn earnest look which spoke of an entrance into a better world were alone visible around the coffin stood the husband and children a whole troop the youngest in the arms they were come to take a last farewell look of their mother the husband kissed her hand which now lay like a withered leaf but which a short time before had been diligently employed in deeds of love for them all tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks and fell in heavy drops on the floor but not a word was spoken the silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief 
 
 with silent steps still sobbing they left the room a burning 
 light remained in the room and a long red wick rose far above the 
 flame which fluttered in the draught of air strange men came in 
 and placed the lid of the coffin over the dead and drove the nails 
 firmly in while the blows of the hammer resounded through the 
 house and echoed in the hearts that were bleeding 
 
 whither art thou leading me asked the guardian angel here 
 dwells no fairy whose pearl could be counted amongst the best gifts of life 
 
 yes she is here here in this sacred hour replied the angel 
 pointing to a corner of the room and there where in her 
 the mother had taken her seat amidst flowers and 
 pictures in that spot where she like the blessed fairy of the 
 house had welcomed husband children and friends and like a 
 sunbeam had spread joy and cheerfulness around her the centre and 
 heart of them all there in that very spot sat a strange woman 
 clothed in long flowing garments and occupying the place of the dead wife and mother it was the fairy and her name was sorrow 
 a hot tear rolled into her lap and formed itself into a pearl glowing with all the colors of the rainbow the angel seized it the pearl 
 glittered like a star with radiance the pearl of sorrow 
 the last which must not be wanting increases the lustre and 
 explains the meaning of all the other pearls 
 
 do you see the shimmer of the rainbow which unites earth to 
 heaven so has there been a bridge built between this world and the 
 next through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the 
 stars to the end of all things then we glance at the pearl of sorrow 
 in which are concealed the wings which shall carry us away to 
 eternal happiness

 a place where convictions are in process of formation 
 he advanced a pace closed the door mechanically behind him and remained standing contemplating what he saw 
 it was a vast and badly lighted apartment now full of uproar now full of silence where all the apparatus of a criminal case with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng was in process of development 
 at the one end of the hall the one where he was were judges with abstracted air in threadbare robes who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids at the other end a ragged crowd lawyers in all sorts of attitudes soldiers with hard but honest faces ancient spotted woodwork a dirty ceiling tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green doors blackened by handmarks lamps which emitted more smoke than light suspended from nails in the wainscot on the tables candles in brass candlesticks darkness ugliness sadness and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law and that grand divine thing which is called justice 
 no one in all that throng paid any attention to him all glances were directed towards a single point a wooden bench placed against a small door in the stretch of wall on the left on this bench illuminated by several candles sat a man between two gendarmes 
 this man was the man 
 he did not seek him he saw him his eyes went thither naturally as though they had known beforehand where that figure was 
 he thought he was looking at himself grown old not absolutely the same in face of course but exactly similar in attitude and aspect with his bristling hair with that wild and uneasy eye with that blouse just as it was on the day when he entered d full of hatred concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison 
 he said to himself with a shudder good god shall i become like that again 
 this creature seemed to be at least sixty there was something indescribably coarse stupid and frightened about him 
 at the sound made by the opening door people had drawn aside to make way for him the president had turned his head and understanding that the personage who had just entered was the mayor of m sur m he had bowed to him the who had seen m madeleine at m sur m whither the duties of his office had called him more than once recognized him and saluted him also 
 he had hardly perceived it he was the victim of a sort of hallucination he was watching 
 judges clerks gendarmes a throng of cruelly curious heads all these he had already beheld once in days gone by years before he had encountered those fatal things once more there they were they moved they existed it was no longer an effort of his memory a mirage of his thought they were real gendarmes and real judges a real crowd and real men of flesh and blood 
 it was all over he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him with all that there is formidable in reality 
 all this was yawning before him 
 he was horrified by it he shut his eyes and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul never 
 and by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble and rendered him nearly mad it was another self of his that was there all called that man who was being tried jean valjean 
 under his very eyes vision he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life enacted by his spectre 
 everything was there the apparatus was the same the hour of the night the faces of the judges of soldiers and of spectators all were the same only above the head there hung a crucifix something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation god had been absent when he had been judged 
 there was a chair behind him he dropped into it terrified at the thought that he might be seen when he was seated he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes which stood on the desk to conceal his face from the whole room he could now see without being seen he had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things gradually he recovered he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen 
 m bamatabois was one of the jurors 
 he looked for javert but did not see him the seat of the witnesses was hidden from him by the table and then as we have just said the hall was sparely lighted 
 at the moment of this entrance the lawyer had just finished his plea 
 the attention of all was excited to the highest pitch the affair had lasted for three hours 
 for three hours that crowd had been watching a strange man a miserable specimen of humanity either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness 
 this man as the reader already knows was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples broken in the orchard of a neighbor called the pierron orchard 
 who was this man an examination had been made witnesses had been heard and they were unanimous light had abounded throughout the entire debate the accusation said we have in our grasp not only a marauder a stealer of fruit we have here in our hands a bandit an old offender who has broken his ban an a miscreant of the most dangerous description a malefactor named jean valjean whom justice has long been in search of and who eight years ago on emerging from the galleys at toulon committed a highway robbery accompanied by violence on the person of a child a savoyard named little gervais a crime provided for by article of the penal code the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter when his identity shall have been judicially established 
 he has just committed a fresh theft it is a case of a second offence condemn him for the fresh deed later on he will be judged for the old crime 
 in the face of this accusation in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey no or else he stared at the ceiling 
 he spoke with difficulty replied with embarrassment but his whole person from head to foot was a denial he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him nevertheless it was a question of the most menacing future for him the likeness increased every moment and the entire crowd surveyed with more anxiety than he did himself that sentence freighted with calamity which descended ever closer over his head there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded besides the galleys a possible death penalty in case his identity were established and the affair of little gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation who was this man what was the nature of his apathy was it imbecility or craft 
 did he understand too well or did he not understand at all these were questions which divided the crowd and seemed to divide the jury there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case 
 the drama was not only melancholy it was also obscure 
 the counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well in that provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar and which was formerly employed by all advocates at paris as well as at romorantin or at montbrison and which having become classic is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic stride a tongue in which a husband is called a consort and a woman a spouse paris the centre of art and civilization the king the monarch monseigneur the bishop a sainted pontiff the the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution the arguments the accents which we have just listened to the age of louis xiv the grand age a theatre the temple of melpomene the reigning family the august blood of our kings a concert a musical solemnity the general commandant of the province the illustrious warrior who etc the pupils in the seminary these tender levities errors imputed to newspapers the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs etc the lawyer had accordingly begun with an explanation as to the theft of the awkward matter couched in fine style but benigne bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion 
 the lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved his client whom he in his character of counsel persisted in calling champmathieu had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that branch by any one 
 he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer preferred to call a bough in his possession but he said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground and had picked it up 
 where was there any proof to the contrary no doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall then thrown away by the alarmed marauder there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case but what proof was there that that thief had been champmathieu one thing only 
 his character as an the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be unhappily well attested the accused had resided at faverolles the accused had exercised the calling of a there the name of champmathieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu all that was true in short four witnesses recognize champmathieu positively and without hesitation as that convict jean valjean to these signs to this testimony the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client the denial of an interested party but supposing that he was the convict jean valjean did that prove that he was the thief of the apples that was a presumption at the most not a proof the prisoner it was true and his counsel in good faith was obliged to admit it had adopted a bad system of defence he obstinately denied everything the theft and his character of convict an admission upon this last point would certainly have been better and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges the counsel had advised him to do this but the accused had obstinately refused thinking no doubt that he would save everything by admitting nothing it was an error but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration 
 this man was visibly stupid wretchedness in the galleys long misery outside the galleys had brutalized him etc 
 he defended himself badly was that a reason for condemning him 
 as for the affair with little gervais the counsel need not discuss it it did not enter into the case 
 the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court if the identity of jean valjean appeared to them to be evident to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence 
 the answered the counsel for the defence he was violent and florid as usually are 
 he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty 
 he reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer 
 the advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was jean valjean 
 he took note of this so this man was jean valjean 
 this point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed 
 here by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime the thundered against the immorality of the romantic school then dawning under the name of the satanic school which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the quotidienne and the oriflamme he attributed not without some probability to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of champmathieu or rather to speak more correctly of jean valjean 
 having exhausted these considerations he passed on to jean valjean himself who was this jean valjean 
 description of jean valjean

 chapter xvi 
 
 kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers 
 when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an inn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both 
 the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on the left the firing became more distinct kutuzov had stopped and was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass 
 look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the distance but down the hill before him the french 
 the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mile and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us 
 the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is that said different voices 
 with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more than five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing a dense french column coming up to meet the apsherons 
 here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thought prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutuzov 
 the apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quite close at hand and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from prince andrew shouted brothers lost and at this as if at a command everyone began to run 
 confused and crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to lose touch with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face red and unlike himself was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing from his cheek prince andrew forced his way to him 
 you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw 
 the wound is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right 
 a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it 
 the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and fired in the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutuzov with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutuzov saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached kutuzov of suite only four remained they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence 
 stop those wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commander pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across suite like a flock of little birds 
 the french had attacked the battery and seeing kutuzov were firing at him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without orders 
 oh oh oh groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked around bolkonski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age bolkonski he whispered pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy that 
 but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard 
 forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a 
 here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him several soldiers fell 
 hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him 
 and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah and overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in prince hands but he was immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned their guns were running toward him he also saw french infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of him at the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a gunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men who evidently did not realize what they were doing 
 what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them why the gunner run away as he is unarmed why the frenchman stab him he will not get away before the frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him 
 and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to the struggling men and the fate of the gunner who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at 
 this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he and fell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle of the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the sky the lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not at all as i ran thought prince andrew not as we ran shouting and fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that lofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it at last yes all is vanity all falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothing nothing but that but even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peace thank god

 book three 
 chapter xvi 
 
 kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers 
 when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an inn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both 
 the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on the left the firing became more distinct kutuzov had stopped and was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass 
 look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the distance but down the hill before him the french 
 the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mile and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us 
 the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is that said different voices 
 with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more than five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing a dense french column coming up to meet the apsherons 
 here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thought prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutuzov 
 the apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quite close at hand and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from prince andrew shouted brothers lost and at this as if at a command everyone began to run 
 confused and crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to lose touch with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face red and unlike himself was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing from his cheek prince andrew forced his way to him 
 you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw 
 the wound is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right 
 a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it 
 the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and fired in the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutuzov with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutuzov saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached kutuzov of suite only four remained they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence 
 stop those wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commander pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across suite like a flock of little birds 
 the french had attacked the battery and seeing kutuzov were firing at him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without orders 
 oh oh oh groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked around bolkonski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age bolkonski he whispered pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy that 
 but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard 
 forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a 
 here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him several soldiers fell 
 hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him 
 and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah and overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in prince hands but he was immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned their guns were running toward him he also saw french infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of him at the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a gunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men who evidently did not realize what they were doing

 and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to the struggling men and the fate of the gunner who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the little mother 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a little boy who had caught cold he had gone out 
 and got wet feet nobody had the least idea how it had happened the 
 weather was quite dry his mother undressed him put him to bed and ordered the teapot to be brought in that she might make him a good cup of tea from the blossoms which is so warming 
 at the same time the old man who lived by himself in the upper storey of the house came in he led a lonely life for he had no wife and children but he loved the children of others very much 
 and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories that it was a 
 pleasure to hear him 
 
 now drink your tea said the mother perhaps you will hear a 
 story 
 
 yes if i only knew a fresh one said the old man and nodded 
 smilingly but how did the little fellow get his wet feet he then 
 asked 
 
 that replied the mother nobody can understand 
 
 will you tell me a story asked the boy 
 
 yes if you can tell me as nearly as possible how deep is the 
 gutter in the little street where you go to school 
 
 just half as high as my replied the boy but then 
 i must stand in the deepest holes 
 
 there now we know where you got your wet feet said the old 
 man i ought to tell you a story but the worst of it is i do not 
 know any more 
 
 you can make one up said the little boy mother says you can 
 tell a fairy tale about anything you look at or touch 
 
 that is all very well but such tales or stories are worth 
 nothing no the right ones come by themselves and knock at my 
 forehead saying here i am 
 
 will not one knock soon asked the boy and the mother smiled 
 while she put blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling 
 water over them pray tell me a story 
 
 yes if stories came by themselves they are so proud they 
 only come when they please but wait he said suddenly there is 
 one look at the teapot there is a story in it now 
 
 and the little boy looked at the teapot the lid rose up 
 gradually the blossoms sprang forth one by one fresh 
 and white long boughs came forth even out of the spout they grew 
 up in all directions and formed a bush nay a large elder tree 
 which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains 
 aside and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance 
 in the midst of the tree sat a old woman with a strange 
 dress it was as green as the leaves and trimmed with large white 
 blossoms so that it was difficult to say whether it was real cloth 
 or the leaves and blossoms of the 
 
 what is this name asked the little boy 
 
 well the romans and greeks used to call her a dryad said the 
 old man but we do not understand that out in the sailors quarter 
 they give her a better name there she is called mother 
 now you must attentively listen to her and look at the beautiful 
 
 
 just such a large tree covered with flowers stands out there 
 it grew in the corner of an humble little yard under this tree sat 
 two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine he was an old old sailor and she his old wife they had already 
 and were soon to celebrate their golden 
 wedding but they could not remember the date and the 
 mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here 
 i know very well when the golden wedding is to take place she said 
 but they did not hear it they were talking of bygone days 
 
 well do you remember said the old sailor when we were quite 
 small and used to run about and play it was in the very same yard 
 where we now are we used to put little branches into the ground and 
 make a garden 
 
 yes said the old woman i remember it very well we used to 
 water the branches and one of them an branch took 
 root and grew and became the large tree under which we are now 
 sitting as old people 
 
 certainly you are right he said and in yonder corner 
 stood a large there i used to sail my boat which i had cut 
 out myself it sailed so well but soon i had to sail somewhere else 
 
 but first we went to school to learn something she said 
 and then we were confirmed we both wept on that day but in the 
 afternoon we went out hand in hand and ascended the high round 
 tower and looked out into the wide world right over copenhagen and the sea then we walked to fredericksburg where the king and the queen were sailing about in their magnificent boat on the canals 
 
 but soon i had to sail about somewhere else and for many 
 years i was travelling about far away from home 
 
 and i often cried about you for i was afraid lest you were 
 drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea many a time i got up in 
 the night and looked if the weathercock had turned it turned often 
 but you did not return i remember one day distinctly the rain was 
 pouring down in torrents the had come to the house where i was in service i went down with the and stood for a moment in the doorway and looked at the dreadful weather then the postman gave me a letter it was from you heavens how that letter had travelled about i tore it open and read it i cried and laughed at 
 the same time and was so happy therein was written that you were 
 staying in the hot countries where the coffee grows these must be 
 marvellous countries you said a great deal about them and i read all 
 while the rain was pouring down and i was standing there with the 
 then suddenly some one put his arm round my waist 
 
 yes and you gave him a hearty smack on the cheek said the old 
 man 
 
 i did not know that it was you you had come as quickly as 
 your letter and you looked so handsome and so you do still you 
 had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a shining 
 hat on you looked so well and the weather in the street was 
 horrible 
 
 then we married he said do you remember how we got our first 
 boy and then mary niels peter john and christian 
 
 oh yes and now they have all grown up and have become useful 
 members of society whom everybody cares for 
 
 and their children have had children again said the old 
 sailor yes these are children and they are strong and 
 healthy if i am not mistaken our wedding took place at this season 
 of the year 
 
 yes is your golden said the little 
 mother stretching her head down between the two old 
 people who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them they looked at each other and clasped hands soon afterwards the children and grandchildren came for they knew very well that it was the golden they had already wished them joy and happiness in the morning but the old people had forgotten it although they remembered things so well that had passed many many years ago the smelt strongly and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people so that they looked quite rosy the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening for they were to have hot potatoes and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried hooray with the others 
 
 but that was no fairy tale said the little boy who had listened 
 to it 
 
 you will presently understand it said the old man who told 
 the story let us ask little mother about it 
 
 that was no fairy tale said the little mother 
 
 but now it comes real life furnishes us with subjects for the most 
 wonderful fairy tales for otherwise my beautiful could not 
 have grown forth out of the teapot 
 
 and then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him on 
 her bosom the elder branches full of blossoms closed over them 
 it was as if they sat in a thick leafy bower which flew with them 
 through the air it was beautiful beyond all description the little 
 mother had suddenly become a charming young girl but her dress was still of the same green material covered with white 
 blossoms as the mother had worn she had a real elder 
 blossom on her bosom and a wreath of the same flowers was wound round her curly golden hair her eyes were so large and so blue that it 
 was wonderful to look at them she and the boy kissed each other 
 and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys they walked hand in hand out of the bower and now stood at home in a beautiful flower garden near the green lawn the was tied to a post there was life in this stick for the little ones for as 
 soon as they seated themselves upon it the polished knob turned into a neighing head a long black mane was fluttering in the wind 
 and four strong slender legs grew out the animal was fiery and 
 spirited they galloped round the lawn hooray now we shall ride far 
 away many miles said the boy we shall ride to the 
 estate where we were last year and they rode round the lawn again 
 and the little girl who as we know was no other than the little 
 mother continually cried now we are in the country do 
 you see the farmhouse there with the large baking stove which 
 projects like a gigantic egg out of the wall into the road the 
 spreads its branches over it and the cock struts about and 
 scratches for the hens look how proud he is now we are near the 
 church it stands on a high hill under the spreading oak trees one 
 of them is half dead now we are at the smithy where the fire roars 
 and the men beat with their hammers so that the sparks 
 fly far and wide be off to the beautiful farm and they passed 
 by everything the little girl who was sitting behind on the stick 
 described and the boy saw it and yet they only went round the 
 lawn then they played in a and marked out a little 
 garden on the ground she took out of her hair and 
 planted them and they grew exactly like those the old people 
 planted when they were children as we have heard before they 
 walked about hand in hand just as the old couple had done when they were little but they did not go to the round tower nor to the 
 fredericksburg garden no the little girl seized the boy round the 
 waist and then they flew far into the country it was spring and it 
 became summer it was autumn and it became winter and thousands of pictures reflected themselves in the eyes and heart and the 
 little girl always sang again you will never forget that and 
 during their whole flight the smelt so sweetly he 
 noticed the roses and the fresh beeches but the smelt much 
 stronger for the flowers were fixed on the little bosom 
 against which the boy often rested his head during the flight 
 it is beautiful here in spring said the little girl and they 
 were again in the green beechwood where the thyme breathed forth 
 sweet fragrance at their feet and the pink anemones looked lovely 
 in the green moss oh that it were always spring in the fragrant 
 beechwood 
 
 here it is splendid in summer she said and they passed by 
 old castles of the age of chivalry the high walls and indented 
 battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches on which swans 
 were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues the corn waved in the field like a yellow sea red and yellow flowers grew in the ditches wild hops and convolvuli in full bloom in the hedges in 
 the evening the moon rose large and round and the hayricks in the 
 meadows smelt sweetly one can never forget it 
 
 here it is beautiful in autumn said the little girl and the 
 atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue while the wood shone with crimson green and gold the hounds were running off flocks of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows while the bramble bushes twined round the old stones the sea was covered with ships and in the barns sat old women girls and 
 children picking hops into a large tub the young ones sang songs and the old people told fairy tales about goblins and sorcerers it 
 could not be more pleasant anywhere 
 
 here agreeable in winter said the little girl and all the 
 trees were covered with so that they looked like white 
 coral the snow creaked under feet as if one had new boots 
 on one shooting star after another traversed the sky in the room the 
 christmas tree was lit and there were song and merriment in the 
 cottage the violin sounded and games were played for 
 apple quarters even the poorest child said it is beautiful in 
 winter 
 
 and indeed it was beautiful and the little girl showed everything 
 to the boy and the continued to breathe forth sweet 
 perfume while the red flag with the white cross was streaming in 
 the wind it was the flag under which the old sailor had served the 
 boy became a youth he was to go out into the wide world far away 
 to the countries where the coffee grows but at parting the little 
 girl took an from her breast and gave it to him as a 
 keepsake he placed it in his and when he opened it in 
 distant lands it was always at the place where the flower of 
 remembrance was lying and the more he looked at it the fresher it 
 became so that he could almost smell the fragrance of the woods at 
 home he distinctly saw the little girl with her bright blue eyes 
 peeping out from behind the petals and heard her whispering here it is beautiful in spring in summer in autumn and in winter and 
 hundreds of pictures passed through his mind 
 
 thus many years rolled by he had now become an old man and was 
 sitting with his old wife under an in full bloom they 
 held each other by the hand exactly as the and the 
 had done outside and like them they talked 
 about bygone days and of their golden wedding the little girl with 
 the blue eyes and in her hair was sitting high up in 
 the tree and nodded to them saying is the golden 
 wedding and then she took two flowers out of her wreath and kissed them they glittered at first like silver then like gold and when 
 she placed them on the heads of the old people each flower became a 
 golden crown there they both sat like a king and queen under the 
 tree which looked exactly like an and he 
 told his wife the story of the mother as it had been told 
 him when he was a little boy they were both of opinion that the story 
 contained many points like their own and these similarities they 
 liked best 
 
 yes so it is said the little girl in the tree some call me 
 little mother others a dryad but my real name is 
 remembrance it is i who sit in the tree which grows and grows i 
 can remember things and tell stories but see if you have 
 still got your flower 
 
 and the old man opened his the was 
 still in it and as fresh as if it had only just been put in 
 remembrance nodded and the two old people with the golden crowns on their heads sat in the glowing evening sun they closed their eyes and and 
 
 well now the story is ended the little boy in bed did not know 
 whether he had dreamt it or heard it told the teapot stood on the 
 table but no was growing out of it and the old man who 
 had told the story was on the point of leaving the room and he did go 
 out 
 
 how beautiful it was said the little boy mother i have 
 been to warm countries 
 
 i believe you said the mother if one takes two cups of hot 
 it is quite natural that one gets into warm countries 
 and she covered him up well so that he might not take cold you have slept soundly while i was arguing with the old man whether it was a story or a fairy tale 
 
 and what has become of the little mother asked the 
 boy 
 
 she is in the teapot said the mother and there she may 
 remain

 projects like a gigantic egg out of the wall into the road the 
 spreads its branches over it and the cock struts about and 
 scratches for the hens look how proud he is now we are near the 
 church it stands on a high hill under the spreading oak trees one 
 of them is half dead now we are at the smithy where the fire roars 
 and the men beat with their hammers so that the sparks 
 fly far and wide be off to the beautiful farm and they passed 
 by everything the little girl who was sitting behind on the stick 
 described and the boy saw it and yet they only went round the 
 lawn then they played in a and marked out a little 
 garden on the ground she took out of her hair and 
 planted them and they grew exactly like those the old people 
 planted when they were children as we have heard before they 
 walked about hand in hand just as the old couple had done when they were little but they did not go to the round tower nor to the 
 fredericksburg garden no the little girl seized the boy round the 
 waist and then they flew far into the country it was spring and it 
 became summer it was autumn and it became winter and thousands of pictures reflected themselves in the eyes and heart and the 
 little girl always sang again you will never forget that and 
 during their whole flight the smelt so sweetly he 
 noticed the roses and the fresh beeches but the smelt much 
 stronger for the flowers were fixed on the little bosom 
 against which the boy often rested his head during the flight 
 it is beautiful here in spring said the little girl and they 
 were again in the green beechwood where the thyme breathed forth 
 sweet fragrance at their feet and the pink anemones looked lovely 
 in the green moss oh that it were always spring in the fragrant 
 beechwood 
 
 here it is splendid in summer she said and they passed by 
 old castles of the age of chivalry the high walls and indented 
 battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches on which swans 
 were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues the corn waved in the field like a yellow sea red and yellow flowers grew in the ditches wild hops and convolvuli in full bloom in the hedges in 
 the evening the moon rose large and round and the hayricks in the 
 meadows smelt sweetly one can never forget it 
 
 here it is beautiful in autumn said the little girl and the 
 atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue while the wood shone with crimson green and gold the hounds were running off flocks of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows while the bramble bushes twined round the old stones the sea was covered with ships and in the barns sat old women girls and 
 children picking hops into a large tub the young ones sang songs and the old people told fairy tales about goblins and sorcerers it 
 could not be more pleasant anywhere 
 
 here agreeable in winter said the little girl and all the 
 trees were covered with so that they looked like white 
 coral the snow creaked under feet as if one had new boots 
 on one shooting star after another traversed the sky in the room the 
 christmas tree was lit and there were song and merriment in the 
 cottage the violin sounded and games were played for 
 apple quarters even the poorest child said it is beautiful in 
 winter 
 
 and indeed it was beautiful and the little girl showed everything 
 to the boy and the continued to breathe forth sweet 
 perfume while the red flag with the white cross was streaming in 
 the wind it was the flag under which the old sailor had served the 
 boy became a youth he was to go out into the wide world far away 
 to the countries where the coffee grows but at parting the little 
 girl took an from her breast and gave it to him as a 
 keepsake he placed it in his and when he opened it in 
 distant lands it was always at the place where the flower of 
 remembrance was lying and the more he looked at it the fresher it 
 became so that he could almost smell the fragrance of the woods at 
 home he distinctly saw the little girl with her bright blue eyes 
 peeping out from behind the petals and heard her whispering here it is beautiful in spring in summer in autumn and in winter and 
 hundreds of pictures passed through his mind 
 
 thus many years rolled by he had now become an old man and was 
 sitting with his old wife under an in full bloom they 
 held each other by the hand exactly as the and the 
 had done outside and like them they talked 
 about bygone days and of their golden wedding the little girl with 
 the blue eyes and in her hair was sitting high up in 
 the tree and nodded to them saying is the golden 
 wedding and then she took two flowers out of her wreath and kissed them they glittered at first like silver then like gold and when 
 she placed them on the heads of the old people each flower became a 
 golden crown there they both sat like a king and queen under the 
 tree which looked exactly like an and he 
 told his wife the story of the mother as it had been told 
 him when he was a little boy they were both of opinion that the story 
 contained many points like their own and these similarities they 
 liked best 
 
 yes so it is said the little girl in the tree some call me 
 little mother others a dryad but my real name is 
 remembrance it is i who sit in the tree which grows and grows i 
 can remember things and tell stories but see if you have 
 still got your flower 
 
 and the old man opened his the was 
 still in it and as fresh as if it had only just been put in 
 remembrance nodded and the two old people with the golden crowns on their heads sat in the glowing evening sun they closed their eyes and and 
 
 well now the story is ended the little boy in bed did not know 
 whether he had dreamt it or heard it told the teapot stood on the 
 table but no was growing out of it and the old man who 
 had told the story was on the point of leaving the room and he did go 
 out 
 
 how beautiful it was said the little boy mother i have 
 been to warm countries 
 
 i believe you said the mother if one takes two cups of hot 
 it is quite natural that one gets into warm countries 
 and she covered him up well so that he might not take cold you have slept soundly while i was arguing with the old man whether it was a story or a fairy tale 
 
 and what has become of the little mother asked the 
 boy 
 
 she is in the teapot said the mother and there she may 
 remain

 chapter x 
 
 the system of denials 
 the moment for closing the debate had arrived 
 the president had the accused stand up and addressed to him the customary question have you anything to add to your defence 
 the man did not appear to understand as he stood there twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had 
 the president repeated the question 
 this time the man heard it 
 he seemed to understand 
 he made a motion like a man who is just waking up cast his eyes about him stared at the audience the gendarmes his counsel the jury the court laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench took another look and all at once fixing his glance upon the he began to speak 
 it was like an eruption it seemed from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth incoherent impetuous tumbling over each other as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once he said 
 this is what i have to say 
 that i have been a wheelwright in paris and that it was with monsieur baloup 
 it is a hard trade in the trade one works always in the open air in courtyards under sheds when the masters are good never in closed workshops because space is required you see 
 in winter one gets so cold that one beats arms together to warm self but the masters like it they say it wastes time handling iron when there is ice between the is hard work that wears a man out quickly one is old while he is still quite young in that trade 
 at forty a man is done for 
 i was i was in a bad state 
 and then workmen are so mean 
 when a man is no longer young they call him nothing but an old bird old beast i was not earning more than thirty sous a day 
 they paid me as little as possible 
 the masters took advantage of my age and then i had my daughter who was a laundress at the river she earned a little also 
 it sufficed for us two 
 she had trouble also all day long up to her waist in a tub in rain in snow when the wind cuts your face when it freezes it is all the same you must still wash 
 there are people who have not much linen and wait until late if you do not wash you lose your custom the planks are badly joined and water drops on you from everywhere you have your petticoats all damp above and below 
 that penetrates she has also worked at the laundry of the where the water comes through faucets 
 you are not in the tub there you wash at the faucet in front of you and rinse in a basin behind you 
 as it is enclosed you are not so cold but there is that hot steam which is terrible and which ruins your eyes she came home at seven in the evening and went to bed at once she was so tired 
 her husband beat her 
 she is dead we have not been very happy 
 she was a good girl who did not go to the ball and who was very peaceable 
 i remember one when she went to bed at eight there i am telling the truth you have only to ask 
 ah yes how stupid i am 
 paris is a gulf who knows father champmathieu there 
 but m baloup does i tell you go see at m and after all i know what is wanted of me 
 the man ceased speaking and remained standing 
 he had said these things in a loud rapid hoarse voice with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness 
 once he paused to salute some one in the crowd the sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came like hiccoughs and to each he added the gesture of a who is splitting wood 
 when he had finished the audience burst into a laugh 
 he stared at the public and perceiving that they were laughing and not understanding why he began to laugh himself 
 it was inauspicious 
 the president an attentive and benevolent man raised his voice 
 he reminded the gentlemen of the jury that the sieur baloup formerly a with whom the accused stated that he had served had been summoned in vain 
 he had become bankrupt and was not to be found 
 then turning to the accused he enjoined him to listen to what he was about to say and added 
 you are in a position where reflection is necessary 
 the gravest presumptions rest upon you and may induce vital results 
 prisoner in your own interests i summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points 
 in the first place did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard break the branch and steal the apples that is to say commit the crime of breaking in and theft in the second place are you the discharged convict jean valjean yes or no 
 the prisoner shook his head with a capable air like a man who has thoroughly understood and who knows what answer he is going to make he opened his mouth turned towards the president and said 
 in the first place 
 then he stared at his cap stared at the ceiling and held his peace 
 prisoner said the in a severe voice pay attention 
 you are not answering anything that has been asked of you 
 your embarrassment condemns you 
 it is evident that your name is not champmathieu that you are the convict jean valjean concealed first under the name of jean mathieu which was the name of his mother that you went to auvergne that you were born at faverolles where you were a pruner of trees it is evident that you have been guilty of entering and of the theft of ripe apples from the pierron orchard 
 the gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion 
 the prisoner had finally resumed his seat he arose abruptly when the had finished and exclaimed 
 you are very wicked that you are 
 this what i wanted to say i could not find words for it at first 
 i have stolen nothing i am a man who does not have something to eat every day i was coming from ailly i was walking through the country after a shower which had made the whole country yellow 
 even the ponds were overflowed and nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside 
 i found a broken branch with apples on the ground i picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble 
 i have been in prison and they have been dragging me about for the last three months more than that i cannot say people talk against me they tell me answer the gendarme who is a good fellow nudges my elbow and says to me in a low voice come answer 
 i know how to explain i have no education i am a poor man that is where they wrong me because they do not see this 
 i have not stolen i picked up from the ground things that were lying there you say jean valjean jean mathieu 
 i know those persons they are villagers 
 i worked for m baloup boulevard de my name is champmathieu 
 you are very clever to tell me where i was born i know myself 
 not everybody who has a house in which to come into the world that would be too convenient i think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways i know nothing different 
 when i was a child they called me young fellow now they call me old fellow those are my baptismal names take that as you like 
 i have been in auvergne i have been at faverolles 
 pardi 
 well a man have been in auvergne or at faverolles without having been in the galleys i tell you that i have not stolen and that i am father champmathieu i have been with m baloup i have had a settled residence you worry me with your nonsense there 
 why is everybody pursuing me so furiously 
 the had remained standing he addressed the president 
 monsieur le president in view of the confused but exceedingly clever denials of the prisoner who would like to pass himself off as an idiot but who will not succeed in so doing we shall attend to demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this place the convicts brevet cochepaille and chenildieu and javert and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict jean valjean 
 i would remind the said the president that javert recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement left the and the town as soon as he had made his deposition we have accorded him permission with the consent of the and of the counsel for the prisoner 
 that is true mr president responded the in the absence of sieur javert i think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago javert is an estimable man who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions 
 these are the terms of his deposition 
 i do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the denial i recognize him perfectly 
 the name of this man is not champmathieu he is an named jean valjean and is very vicious and much to be feared 
 it is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term 
 he underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft 
 he made five or six attempts to escape besides the theft from little gervais and from the pierron orchard i suspect him of a theft committed in the house of his grace the late bishop of d i often saw him at the time when i was adjutant of the at the prison in toulon 
 i repeat that i recognize him perfectly 
 this extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression on the public and on the jury 
 the concluded by insisting that in default of javert the three witnesses brevet chenildieu and cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated 
 the president transmitted the order to an usher and a moment later the door of the witnesses room opened 
 the usher accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance introduced the convict brevet 
 the audience was in suspense and all breasts heaved as though they had contained but one soul 
 the brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons 
 brevet was a person sixty years of age who had a sort of business face and the air of a rascal the two sometimes go together 
 in prison whither fresh misdeeds had led him he had become something in the nature of a turnkey he was a man of whom his superiors said he tries to make himself of use 
 the chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits it must not be forgotten that this passed under the restoration 
 brevet said the president you have undergone an ignominious sentence and you cannot take an oath 
 brevet dropped his eyes 
 nevertheless continued the president even in the man whom the law has degraded there may remain when the divine mercy permits it a sentiment of honor and of equity 
 it is to this sentiment that i appeal at this decisive hour 
 if it still exists in i hope it before replying to me consider on the one hand this man whom a word from you may ruin on the other hand justice which a word from you may enlighten the instant is solemn there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken 
 rise prisoner 
 brevet take a good look at the accused recall your souvenirs and tell us on your soul and conscience if you persist in recognizing this man as your former companion in the galleys jean valjean 
 brevet looked at the prisoner then turned towards the court 
 yes mr president i was the first to recognize him and i stick to it that man is jean valjean who entered at toulon in and left in 
 i left a year later 
 he has the air of a brute now but it must be because age has brutalized him he was sly at the galleys i recognize him positively 
 take your seat said the president 
 prisoner remain standing 
 chenildieu was brought in a prisoner for life as was indicated by his red cassock and his green cap 
 he was serving out his sentence at the galleys of toulon whence he had been brought for this case he was a small man of about fifty brisk wrinkled frail yellow feverish who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person and an immense force in his glance his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him dieu chenildieu 
 the president addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used to brevet 
 at the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which deprived him of the right to take an oath chenildieu raised his head and looked the crowd in the face 
 the president invited him to reflection and asked him as he had asked brevet if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner 
 chenildieu burst out laughing 
 pardieu as if i recognize him 
 we were attached to the same chain for five years 
 so you are sulking old fellow 
 go take your seat said the president 
 the usher brought in cochepaille 
 he was another convict for life who had come from the galleys and was dressed in red like chenildieu was a peasant from lourdes and a of the pyrenees he had guarded the flocks among the mountains and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand 
 cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner 
 he was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys 
 the president tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words and asked him as he had asked the other two if he persisted without hesitation or trouble in recognizing the man who was standing before him 
 he is jean valjean said cochepaille 
 he was even called because he was so strong 
 each of these affirmations from these three men evidently sincere and in good faith had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding 
 the prisoner had listened to them with that astounded face which was according to the accusation his principal means of defence at the first the gendarmes his neighbors had heard him mutter between his teeth 
 ah well a nice one after the second he said a little louder with an air that was almost that of satisfaction good at the third he cried famous 
 the president addressed him 
 have you heard prisoner 
 what have you to say 
 he replied 
 i say famous 
 an uproar broke out among the audience and was communicated to the jury it was evident that the man was lost 
 ushers said the president enforce silence 
 i am going to sum up the arguments 
 at that moment there was a movement just beside the president a voice was heard crying 
 brevet 
 chenildieu 
 cochepaille look here 
 all who heard that voice were chilled so lamentable and terrible was it all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded a man placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court had just risen had pushed open the which separated the tribunal from the audience and was standing in the middle of the hall the president the m bamatabois twenty persons recognized him and exclaimed in concert

 on our right flank commanded by bagration at nine the battle had not yet begun not wishing to agree to demand to commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself prince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of the commander in chief bagration knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed which he very likely would be and found the commander in chief which would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before evening 
 bagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite and the boyish face rostov breathless with excitement and hope was the first to catch his eye he sent him 
 and if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in chief your excellency said rostov with his hand to his cap 
 you can give the message to his majesty said dolgorukov hurriedly interrupting bagration 
 on being relieved from picket duty rostov had managed to get a few hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy 
 all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a message to kutuzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joy and happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line at first he rode along the line of troops which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless then he came to the region occupied by cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having passed cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louder 
 in the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar 
 he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading and mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons 
 rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why whither and who they were it was impossible to make out these sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on the contrary they stimulated his energy and determination 
 go on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action 
 how it will be there i know but all will be well thought rostov 
 after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line the guards was already in action 
 so much the better i shall see it close he thought 
 he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack rostov got out of their way involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped on 
 that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him and across his path rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of the horses were already galloping rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and even their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guards advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet them 
 the horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horses rostov could already see their faces and heard the command charge shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed rostov fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the french galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still was not in time to avoid them 
 the last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily on seeing rostov before him with whom he would inevitably collide this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his bedouin over rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses had it not occurred to rostov to flourish his whip before the eyes of the horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail and extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guards passed rostov before he heard them shout hurrah and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets probably french he could see nothing more for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything 
 at that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared in the smoke rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards that amazed the french themselves rostov was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant rich youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their horses only eighteen were left after the charge 
 why should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall see the emperor immediately thought rostov and galloped on 
 when he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers 
 passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard a voice calling him by name 
 rostov 
 what he answered not recognizing boris 
 i say been in the front line our regiment attacked said boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time 
 rostov stopped 
 have you he said well how did it go 
 we drove them back said boris with animation growing talkative can you imagine it and he began describing how the guards having taken up their position and seeing troops before them thought they were austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action rostov without hearing boris to the end spurred his horse 
 where are you off to asked boris 
 with a message to his majesty 
 there he is said boris thinking rostov had said his highness and pointing to the grand duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and horse guards jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed austrian officer 
 but the grand duke and i want the commander in chief or the emperor said rostov and was about to spur his horse 
 count count shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eager as boris count i am wounded in my right hand and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained at the front i held my sword in my left hand count all our family the von bergs have been knights 
 he said something more but rostov did not wait to hear it and rode away 
 having passed the guards and traversed an empty space rostov to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horse guards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops where he could never have expected the enemy to be 
 what can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our army impossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle but be that what it may he reflected there is no riding round it now i must look for the commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest 
 the foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds 
 what does it mean what is it whom are they firing at who is firing rostov kept asking as he came up to russian and austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path 
 the devil knows killed everybody all up now he was told in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did 
 kill the germans shouted one 
 may the devil take them the traitors 
 zum henker diese russen muttered a german 
 hang these russians 
 several wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screams and groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died down rostov learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firing at one another 
 my god what does it all mean thought he and here where at any moment the emperor may see them but no these must be only a handful of scoundrels it will soon be over it be that it be only to get past them quicker quicker 
 the idea of defeat and flight could not enter head though he saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief he could not did not wish to believe that

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the little 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it was terribly cold and nearly dark on the last evening of the 
 old year and the snow was falling fast in the cold and the darkness 
 a poor little girl with bare head and naked feet roamed through 
 the streets it is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left 
 home but they were not of much use they were very large so large 
 indeed that they had belonged to her mother and the poor little 
 creature had lost them in running across the street to avoid two 
 carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate one of the 
 slippers she could not find and a boy seized upon the other and ran 
 away with it saying that he could use it as a cradle when he had 
 children of his own so the little girl went on with her little 
 naked feet which were quite red and blue with the cold in an old 
 apron she carried a number of matches and had a bundle of them in her hands no one had bought anything of her the whole day nor had any one given here even a penny shivering with cold and hunger she crept along poor little child she looked the picture of misery the 
 snowflakes fell on her long fair hair which hung in curls on her 
 shoulders but she regarded them not 
 
 lights were shining from every window and there was a savory 
 smell of roast goose for it was eve yes she remembered 
 that in a corner between two houses one of which projected beyond the other she sank down and huddled herself together she had drawn her little feet under her but she could not keep off the cold and she dared not go home for she had sold no matches and could not take home even a penny of money her father would certainly beat her besides it was almost as cold at home as here for they had only the roof to cover them through which the wind howled although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags 
 her little hands were almost frozen with the cold ah perhaps a burning match might be some good if she could draw it from the bundle and strike it against the wall just to warm her fingers she drew one how it sputtered as it burnt it gave a warm bright light like a little candle as she held her hand over it it was 
 really a wonderful light it seemed to the little girl that she was 
 sitting by a large iron stove with polished brass feet and a brass 
 ornament how the fire burned and seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them when lo the flame 
 of the match went out the stove vanished and she had only the 
 remains of the match in her hand 
 
 she rubbed another match on the wall it burst into a flame and 
 where its light fell upon the wall it became as transparent as a veil 
 and she could see into the room the table was covered with a snowy 
 white on which stood a splendid dinner service and a 
 steaming roast goose stuffed with apples and dried plums and what 
 was still more wonderful the goose jumped down from the dish and 
 waddled across the floor with a knife and fork in its breast to 
 the little girl then the match went out and there remained nothing 
 but the thick damp cold wall before her 
 
 she lighted another match and then she found herself sitting 
 under a beautiful it was larger and more beautifully 
 decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door at 
 the rich thousands of tapers were burning upon the green 
 branches and colored pictures like those she had seen in the 
 looked down upon it all the little one stretched out 
 her hand towards them and the match went out 
 
 the christmas lights rose higher and higher till they looked to 
 her like the stars in the sky then she saw a star fall leaving 
 behind it a bright streak of fire some one is dying thought the 
 little girl for her old grandmother the only one who had ever 
 loved her and who was now dead had told her that when a star 
 falls a soul was going up to god 
 
 she again rubbed a match on the wall and the light shone round 
 her in the brightness stood her old grandmother clear and shining 
 yet mild and loving in her appearance grandmother cried the little 
 one o take me with you i know you will go away when the match burns out you will vanish like the warm stove the roast goose and the large glorious and she made haste to light the whole bundle of matches for she wished to keep her grandmother there and the matches glowed with a light that was brighter than the and her grandmother had never appeared so large or so beautiful she took the little girl in her arms and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain for they were with god 
 
 in the dawn of morning there lay the poor little one with pale 
 cheeks and smiling mouth leaning against the wall she had been 
 frozen to death on the last evening of the year and the 
 sun rose and shone upon a little corpse the child still sat in the 
 stiffness of death holding the matches in her hand one bundle of 
 which was burnt she tried to warm herself said some no one 
 imagined what beautiful things she had seen nor into what glory she 
 had entered with her grandmother on day

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter xi 
 
 champmathieu more and more astonished 
 it was he in fact 
 the lamp illumined his countenance he held his hat in his hand there was no disorder in his clothing his coat was carefully buttoned he was very pale and he trembled slightly his hair which had still been gray on his arrival in arras was now entirely white 
 it had turned white during the hour he had sat there 
 all heads were raised 
 the sensation was indescribable there was a momentary hesitation in the audience the voice had been so the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first 
 they asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry 
 this indecision only lasted a few seconds 
 even before the president and the could utter a word before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture the man whom all still called at that moment m madeleine had advanced towards the witnesses cochepaille brevet and chenildieu 
 do you not recognize me said he 
 all three remained speechless and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him 
 cochepaille who was intimidated made a military salute 
 m madeleine turned towards the jury and the court and said in a gentle voice 
 gentlemen of the jury order the prisoner to be released mr president have me arrested 
 he is not the man whom you are in search of it is i i am jean valjean 
 not a mouth breathed the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done 
 in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the and a few words with the assistant judges he addressed the public and asked in accents which all understood 
 is there a physician present 
 the took the word 
 gentlemen of the jury the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us like yourselves only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express you all know by reputation at least the honorable m madeleine mayor of m sur m if there is a physician in the audience we join the president in requesting him to attend to m madeleine and to conduct him to his home 
 did not allow the to finish he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority these are the words which he uttered here they are literally as they were written down immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago 
 i thank you mr but i am not mad you shall see you were on the point of committing a great error release this man i am fulfilling a duty i am that miserable criminal 
 i am the only one here who sees the matter clearly and i am telling you the truth 
 god who is on high looks down on what i am doing at this moment and that suffices 
 you can take me for here i am but i have done my best i concealed myself under another name i have become rich i have become a mayor i have tried to the ranks of the honest 
 it seems that that is not to be done in short there are many things which i cannot tell 
 i will not narrate the story of my life to you you will hear it one of these days i robbed monseigneur the bishop it is true it is true that i robbed little gervais they were right in telling you that jean valjean was a very vicious wretch 
 perhaps it was not altogether his fault 
 listen honorable judges a man who has been so greatly humbled as i have has neither any remonstrances to make to providence nor any advice to give to society but you see the infamy from which i have tried to escape is an injurious thing the galleys make the convict what he is reflect upon that if you please before going to the galleys i was a poor peasant with very little intelligence a sort of idiot the galleys wrought a change in me 
 i was stupid i became vicious 
 i was a block of wood i became a firebrand 
 later on indulgence and kindness saved me as severity had ruined me 
 but pardon me you cannot understand what i am saying 
 you will find at my house among the ashes in the fireplace the piece which i stole seven years ago from little gervais 
 i have nothing farther to add take me good god the shakes his head you say m madeleine has gone mad you do not believe me that is distressing 
 do not at least condemn this man 
 what these men do not recognize me i wish javert were here he would recognize me 
 nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words 
 he turned to the three convicts and said 
 well i recognize you do you remember brevet 
 he paused hesitated for an instant and said 
 do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys 
 brevet gave a start of surprise and surveyed him from head to foot with a frightened air 
 he continued 
 chenildieu you who conferred on yourself the name of your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn because you one day laid your shoulder against the full of coals in order to efface the three letters t f p which are still visible nevertheless answer is this true 
 it is true said chenildieu 
 he addressed himself to cochepaille 
 cochepaille you have near the bend in your left arm a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder the date is that of the landing of the emperor at cannes march pull up your sleeve 
 cochepaille pushed up his sleeve all eyes were focused on him and on his bare arm 
 a gendarme held a light close to it there was the date 
 the unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it 
 it was a smile of triumph it was also a smile of despair 
 you see plainly he said that i am jean valjean 
 in that chamber there were no longer either judges accusers nor gendarmes there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts 
 no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play the forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting the president that he was there to preside the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend it was a striking circumstance that no question was put that no authority intervened 
 the peculiarity of sublime spectacles is that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators no one probably could have explained what he felt no one probably said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light 
 all felt themselves inwardly dazzled 
 it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes that was clear 
 the appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously without any further explanation 
 the whole crowd as by a sort of electric revelation understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead the details the hesitations little possible oppositions were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact 
 it was an impression which vanished speedily but which was irresistible at the moment 
 i do not wish to disturb the court further resumed jean valjean i shall withdraw since you do not arrest me 
 i have many things to do the knows who i am he knows whither i am going he can have me arrested when he likes 
 he directed his steps towards the door 
 not a voice was raised not an arm extended to hinder him 
 all stood aside 
 at that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man 
 he traversed the crowd slowly it was never known who opened the door but it is certain that he found the door open when he reached it 
 on arriving there he turned round and said 
 i am at your command mr 
 then he addressed the audience 
 all of you all who are me worthy of pity do you not 
 good god 
 when i think of what i was on the point of doing i consider that i am to be envied 
 nevertheless i should have preferred not to have had this occur 
 he withdrew and the door closed behind him as it had opened for those who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some one in the crowd 
 less than an hour after this the verdict of the jury freed the said champmathieu from all accusations and champmathieu being at once released went off in a state of stupefaction thinking that all men were fools and comprehending nothing of this vision

 book champmathieu affair 
 chapter xi 
 
 champmathieu more and more astonished 
 it was he in fact 
 the lamp illumined his countenance he held his hat in his hand there was no disorder in his clothing his coat was carefully buttoned he was very pale and he trembled slightly his hair which had still been gray on his arrival in arras was now entirely white 
 it had turned white during the hour he had sat there 
 all heads were raised 
 the sensation was indescribable there was a momentary hesitation in the audience the voice had been so the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first 
 they asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry 
 this indecision only lasted a few seconds 
 even before the president and the could utter a word before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture the man whom all still called at that moment m madeleine had advanced towards the witnesses cochepaille brevet and chenildieu 
 do you not recognize me said he 
 all three remained speechless and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him 
 cochepaille who was intimidated made a military salute 
 m madeleine turned towards the jury and the court and said in a gentle voice 
 gentlemen of the jury order the prisoner to be released mr president have me arrested 
 he is not the man whom you are in search of it is i i am jean valjean 
 not a mouth breathed the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done 
 in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the and a few words with the assistant judges he addressed the public and asked in accents which all understood 
 is there a physician present 
 the took the word 
 gentlemen of the jury the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us like yourselves only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express you all know by reputation at least the honorable m madeleine mayor of m sur m if there is a physician in the audience we join the president in requesting him to attend to m madeleine and to conduct him to his home 
 did not allow the to finish he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority these are the words which he uttered here they are literally as they were written down immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago 
 i thank you mr but i am not mad you shall see you were on the point of committing a great error release this man i am fulfilling a duty i am that miserable criminal 
 i am the only one here who sees the matter clearly and i am telling you the truth 
 god who is on high looks down on what i am doing at this moment and that suffices 
 you can take me for here i am but i have done my best i concealed myself under another name i have become rich i have become a mayor i have tried to the ranks of the honest 
 it seems that that is not to be done in short there are many things which i cannot tell 
 i will not narrate the story of my life to you you will hear it one of these days i robbed monseigneur the bishop it is true it is true that i robbed little gervais they were right in telling you that jean valjean was a very vicious wretch 
 perhaps it was not altogether his fault 
 listen honorable judges a man who has been so greatly humbled as i have has neither any remonstrances to make to providence nor any advice to give to society but you see the infamy from which i have tried to escape is an injurious thing the galleys make the convict what he is reflect upon that if you please before going to the galleys i was a poor peasant with very little intelligence a sort of idiot the galleys wrought a change in me 
 i was stupid i became vicious 
 i was a block of wood i became a firebrand 
 later on indulgence and kindness saved me as severity had ruined me 
 but pardon me you cannot understand what i am saying 
 you will find at my house among the ashes in the fireplace the piece which i stole seven years ago from little gervais 
 i have nothing farther to add take me good god the shakes his head you say m madeleine has gone mad you do not believe me that is distressing 
 do not at least condemn this man 
 what these men do not recognize me i wish javert were here he would recognize me 
 nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words 
 he turned to the three convicts and said 
 well i recognize you do you remember brevet 
 he paused hesitated for an instant and said 
 do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys 
 brevet gave a start of surprise and surveyed him from head to foot with a frightened air 
 he continued 
 chenildieu you who conferred on yourself the name of your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn because you one day laid your shoulder against the full of coals in order to efface the three letters t f p which are still visible nevertheless answer is this true 
 it is true said chenildieu 
 he addressed himself to cochepaille 
 cochepaille you have near the bend in your left arm a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder the date is that of the landing of the emperor at cannes march pull up your sleeve

 book three 
 chapter xviii 
 
 rostov had been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor near the village of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officer were there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds he urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but the farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of all sorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded and some not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries stationed on the pratzen heights 
 where is the emperor where is kutuzov rostov kept asking everyone he could stop but got no answer from anyone 
 at last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer 
 eh brother all bolted long ago said the soldier laughing for some reason and shaking himself free 
 having left that soldier who was evidently drunk rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him the man announced that the tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded 
 it be said rostov it must have been someone else 
 i saw him myself replied the man with a smile of derision i ought to know the emperor by now after the times seen him in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat in the carriage as pale as anything how they made the four black horses fly gracious me they did rattle past time i knew the imperial horses and ilya ivanych i think ilya drives anyone except the tsar 
 rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a wounded officer passing by addressed him 
 who is it you want he asked the commander in chief he was killed by a cannon ball struck in the breast before our regiment 
 not killed wounded another officer corrected him 
 who kutuzov asked rostov 
 not kutuzov but his name well never mind there are not many left alive go that way to that village all the commanders are there said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek and he walked on 
 rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going the emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible to doubt it now rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in which he saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now to say to the tsar or to kutuzov even if they were alive and unwounded 
 take this road your honor that way you will be killed at once a soldier shouted to him kill you there 
 oh what are you talking about said another where is he to go that way is nearer 
 rostov considered and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed 
 all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to save myself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from pratzen the french had not yet occupied that region and the russians the uninjured and slightly wounded had left it long ago all about the field like heaps of manure on plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres the wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feigned or so it seemed to rostov he put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men and he felt afraid afraid not for his life but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates 
 the french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots the sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself he remembered his last letter what would she feel thought he if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me 
 in the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from the field of battle who though still in some confusion were less disordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the emperor or kutuzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded was correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified count tolstoy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the suite one officer told rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left and thither rostov rode not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience when he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russian troops he saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men on horseback facing the ditch one with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to rostov the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which rostov fancied he had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with his spurs and giving it the rein leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the hind hoofs turning the horse sharply he again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same the rider whose figure seemed familiar to rostov and involuntarily riveted his attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch 
 but it be he alone in the midst of this empty field thought rostov at that moment alexander turned his head and rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the emperor was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm the mildness of his features was all the greater rostov was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false he was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver 
 but as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the moment comes and he is alone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so 
 what it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to him now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall those speeches were intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved 
 besides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four and the battle is lost no certainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on his reflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him rostov decided and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsar who still remained in the same attitude of indecision 
 while rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing the emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling unwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke long and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von hand 
 and i might have been in his place thought rostov and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utter despair not knowing where to or why he was now riding 
 his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause his grief 
 he might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign it was a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had not made use of it what have i done thought he and he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor but there was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriages were passing by from one of the drivers he learned that staff were not far off in the village the vehicles were going to rostov followed them in front of him walked groom leading horses in horsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an old domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat 
 tit i say tit said the groom 
 what answered the old man 
 go tit thresh a bit 
 oh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed in silence and then the same joke was repeated 
 before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points more than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the french 
 przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses 
 the remains of and mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesd 
 after five it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade delivered by the french alone was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights directed at our retreating forces 
 in the rearguard dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops it was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which for so many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one another dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way 
 every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some and splashing with blood those near them 
 dolokhov now an officer wounded in the arm and on foot with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company represented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by the crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed in on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someone behind them another fell in front and splashed dolokhov with blood the crowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a few steps and again stopped 
 move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here another two minutes and it is certain death thought each one 
 dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool 
 turn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked under him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun it bears 
 the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even under his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bank hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address dolokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him 
 get onto the ice over the ice go on turn you hear go on innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were shouting 
 one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped into the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop go on go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held under those on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another 
 still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam the pond and the bank

 the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even under his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bank hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address dolokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him 
 get onto the ice over the ice go on turn you hear go on innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were shouting 
 one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped into the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop go on go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held under those on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another 
 still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam the pond and the bank

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the little mermaid 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far out in the ocean where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal it is very very deep so deep indeed that no cable could fathom it many church steeples piled one upon another would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above there dwell the sea king and his subjects we must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand no indeed the most singular flowers and plants grow there the leaves and stems of which are so pliant that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life fishes both large and small glide between the branches as birds fly among the trees here upon land in the deepest spot of all stands the castle of the sea king 
 
 its walls are built of coral and the long gothic windows are of 
 the clearest amber the roof is formed of shells that open and 
 close as the water flows over them their appearance is very 
 beautiful for in each lies a glittering pearl which would be fit for 
 the diadem of a queen 
 
 the sea king had been a widower for many years and his aged 
 mother kept house for him she was a very wise woman and 
 exceedingly proud of her high birth on that account she wore twelve 
 oysters on her tail while others also of high rank were only 
 allowed to wear six she was however deserving of very great praise especially for her care of the little her 
 they were six beautiful children but the youngest 
 was the prettiest of them all her skin was as clear and delicate as a 
 and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea but like all 
 the others she had no feet and her body ended in a tail 
 
 all day long they played in the great halls of the castle or among 
 the living flowers that grew out of the walls the large amber windows 
 were open and the fish swam in just as the swallows fly into our 
 houses when we open the windows excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses ate out of their hands and allowed themselves to be stroked outside the castle there was a beautiful garden in 
 which grew bright red and dark blue flowers and blossoms like 
 flames of fire the fruit glittered like gold and the leaves and 
 stems waved to and fro continually the earth itself was the finest 
 sand but blue as the flame of burning sulphur over everything lay 
 a peculiar blue radiance as if it were surrounded by the air from 
 above through which the blue sky shone instead of the dark depths of the sea in calm weather the sun could be seen looking like a 
 purple flower with the light streaming from the calyx each of the 
 young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden where 
 she might dig and plant as she pleased one arranged her 
 into the form of a whale another thought it better to make hers 
 like the figure of a little mermaid but that of the youngest was 
 round like the sun and contained flowers as red as his rays at 
 sunset she was a strange child quiet and thoughtful and while her 
 sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they 
 obtained from the wrecks of vessels she cared for nothing but her 
 pretty red flowers like the sun excepting a beautiful marble statue 
 it was the representation of a handsome boy carved out of pure 
 white stone which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck 
 
 she planted by the statue a weeping willow it grew 
 splendidly and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue 
 almost down to the blue sands the shadow had a violet tint and waved to and fro like the branches it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play and trying to kiss each other nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea 
 she made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns the people and the animals to her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance and not those below the sea that the trees of the forest should be green and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly that it was quite a pleasure to hear them her grandmother 
 called the little birds fishes or she would not have understood 
 her for she had never seen birds 
 
 when you have reached your fifteenth year said the 
 you will have permission to rise up out of the sea 
 to sit on the rocks in the moonlight while the great ships are 
 sailing by and then you will see both forests and towns 
 
 in the following year one of the sisters would be fifteen but as 
 each was a year younger than the other the youngest would have to 
 wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the 
 ocean and see the earth as we do however each promised to tell 
 the others what she saw on her first visit and what she thought the 
 most beautiful for their grandmother could not tell them enough 
 there were so many things on which they wanted information none of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest she who had the longest time to wait and who was so quiet and thoughtful 
 
 many nights she stood by the open window looking up through the 
 dark blue water and watching the fish as they splashed about with 
 their fins and tails she could see the moon and stars shining 
 faintly but through the water they looked larger than they do to 
 our eyes when something like a black cloud passed between her and 
 them she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head or a ship full of human beings who never imagined that a pretty little 
 mermaid was standing beneath them holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship 
 
 as soon as the eldest was fifteen she was allowed to rise to 
 the surface of the ocean when she came back she had hundreds of 
 things to talk about but the most beautiful she said was to lie 
 in the moonlight on a sandbank in the quiet sea near the coast and 
 to gaze on a large town nearby where the lights were twinkling like 
 hundreds of stars to listen to the sounds of the music the noise 
 of carriages and the voices of human beings and then to hear the 
 merry bells peal out from the church steeples and because she could 
 not go near to all those wonderful things she longed for them more 
 than ever oh did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all these 
 descriptions and afterwards when she stood at the open window 
 looking up through the dark blue water she thought of the great city 
 with all its bustle and noise and even fancied she could hear the 
 sound of the church bells down in the depths of the sea 
 in another year the second sister received permission to rise to 
 the surface of the water and to swim about where she pleased she 
 rose just as the sun was setting and this she said was the most 
 beautiful sight of all the whole sky looked like gold while violet 
 and clouds which she could not describe floated over 
 her and still more rapidly than the clouds flew a large flock of 
 wild swans towards the setting sun looking like a long white veil 
 across the sea she also swam towards the sun but it sunk into the 
 waves and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea 
 
 the third turn followed she was the boldest of them all 
 and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea on the 
 banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines palaces and 
 castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest she 
 heard the birds singing and the rays of the sun were so powerful that 
 she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face in a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children quite naked and sporting about in the water she wanted to play with them but they fled in a great fright and then a 
 little black animal came to the water it was a dog but she did not 
 know that for she had never before seen one this animal barked at 
 her so terribly that she became frightened and rushed back to the 
 open sea but she said she should never forget the beautiful forest 
 the green hills and the pretty little children who could swim in 
 the water although they had not tails 
 
 the fourth sister was more timid she remained in the midst of the 
 sea but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the 
 land she could see for so many miles around her and the sky above 
 looked like a bell of glass she had seen the ships but at such a 
 great distance that they looked like the dolphins sported 
 in the waves and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils 
 till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every 
 direction 
 the fifth birthday occurred in the winter so when her 
 turn came she saw what the others had not seen the first time they 
 went up the sea looked quite green and large icebergs were 
 floating about each like a pearl she said but larger and loftier 
 than the churches built by men they were of the most singular shapes 
 and glittered like diamonds she had seated herself upon one of the 
 largest and let the wind play with her long hair and she remarked 
 that all the ships sailed by rapidly and steered as far away as 
 they could from the iceberg as if they were afraid of it towards 
 evening as the sun went down dark clouds covered the sky the 
 thunder rolled and the lightning flashed and the red light glowed 
 on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea on all 
 the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling while she sat 
 calmly on the floating iceberg watching the blue lightning as it 
 darted its forked flashes into the sea 
 
 when first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface they 
 were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw but 
 now as girls they could go when they pleased and they 
 had become indifferent about it they wished themselves back again 
 in the water and after a month had passed they said it was much 
 more beautiful down below and pleasanter to be at home yet often in the evening hours the five sisters would twine their arms round 
 each other and rise to the surface in a row they had more beautiful 
 voices than any human being could have and before the approach of a storm and when they expected a ship would be lost they swam before the vessel and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom but the sailors could not understand the song they took it for the howling of the storm and these things were never to be 
 beautiful for them for if the ship sank the men were drowned and 
 their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the sea king 
 
 when the sisters rose through the water in this 
 way their youngest sister would stand quite alone looking after 
 them ready to cry only that the mermaids have no tears and 
 therefore they suffer more oh were i but fifteen years old said 
 she i know that i shall love the world up there and all the 
 people who live in it 
 
 at last she reached her fifteenth year well now you are 
 grown up said the old dowager her grandmother so you must let 
 me adorn you like your other sisters and she placed a wreath of 
 white lilies in her hair and every flower leaf was half a pearl then 
 the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the 
 tail of the princess to show her high rank 
 
 but they hurt me so said the little mermaid 
 
 pride must suffer pain replied the old lady oh how gladly she 
 would have shaken off all this grandeur and laid aside the heavy 
 wreath the red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better but she could not help herself so she said farewell and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water the sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty the sea was calm and the air mild and fresh a large ship with three masts lay becalmed on the water with only one sail set for not a breeze stiffed and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging there was music and song on board and as darkness came on a hundred colored lanterns were lighted as if the flags of all nations waved in the air the little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows and now and then as the waves lifted her up she could look in through clear glass and see a number of people within 
 among them was a young prince the most beautiful of all with large black eyes he was sixteen years of age and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing the sailors were dancing on deck but when the prince came out of the cabin more than a hundred rockets rose in 
 the air making it as bright as day the little mermaid was so 
 startled that she dived under water and when she again stretched 
 out her head it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling 
 around her she had never seen such fireworks before great suns 
 spurted fire about splendid fireflies flew into the blue air and 
 everything was reflected in the clear calm sea beneath the ship 
 itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people and even the 
 smallest rope could be distinctly and plainly seen and how 
 handsome the young prince looked as he pressed the hands of all 
 present and smiled at them while the music resounded through the 
 clear night air 
 
 it was very late yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes 
 from the ship or from the beautiful prince the colored lanterns 
 had been extinguished no more rockets rose in the air and the cannon had ceased firing but the sea became restless and a moaning 
 grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves still the little 
 mermaid remained by the cabin window rocking up and down on the 
 water which enabled her to look in after a while the sails were 
 quickly unfurled and the noble ship continued her passage but soon 
 the waves rose higher heavy clouds darkened the sky and lightning 
 appeared in the distance a dreadful storm was approaching once 
 more the sails were reefed and the great ship pursued her flying 
 course over the raging sea the waves rose mountains high as if 
 they would have overtopped the mast but the ship dived like a swan 
 between them and then rose again on their lofty foaming crests to 
 the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport not so to the 
 sailors at length the ship groaned and creaked the thick planks gave 
 way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck the 
 mainmast snapped asunder like a reed the ship lay over on her side 
 and the water rushed in the little mermaid now perceived that the 
 crew were in danger even she herself was obliged to be careful to 
 avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the 
 water at one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a 
 single object but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene 
 she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince 
 when the ship parted she had seen him sink into the deep waves and 
 she was glad for she thought he would now be with her and then she 
 remembered that human beings could not live in the water so that when he got down to her palace he would be quite dead but he must not die so she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea forgetting that they could crush her to pieces then she dived deeply under the dark waters rising and 
 falling with the waves till at length she managed to reach the 
 young prince who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea his limbs were failing him his beautiful eyes were closed and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his 
 assistance she held his head above the water and let the waves drift 
 them where they would 
 
 in the morning the storm had ceased but of the ship not a 
 single fragment could be seen the sun rose up red and glowing from 
 the water and its beams brought back the hue of health to the 
 cheeks but his eyes remained closed the mermaid kissed 
 his high smooth forehead and stroked back his wet hair he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden and she kissed him 
 again and wished that he might live presently they came in sight 
 of land she saw lofty blue mountains on which the white snow 
 rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them near the coast 
 were beautiful green forests and close by stood a large building 
 whether a church or a convent she could not tell orange and citron 
 trees grew in the garden and before the door stood lofty palms the 
 sea here formed a little bay in which the water was quite still 
 but very deep so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach 
 which was covered with fine white sand and there she laid him in the 
 warm sunshine taking care to raise his head higher than his body 
 
 then bells sounded in the large white building and a number of 
 young girls came into the garden the little mermaid swam out 
 farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen and watched to see what would become of the poor prince she did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay 
 she seemed frightened at first but only for a moment then she fetched a number of people and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again and smiled upon those who stood round him but to her he sent no smile he knew not that she had saved him this made her very unhappy and when he was led away into the great building she dived down sorrowfully into the water and returned to her castle she had always been silent and thoughtful and now she was more so than ever her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water but she would tell them nothing many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince she saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away but she never saw the prince and therefore she returned home always more sorrowful than before it was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince but she gave up tending her flowers and they grew in wild confusion over the paths twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees so that the whole place became dark and gloomy at length she could bear it no longer and told one of her sisters all about it then the others heard the secret and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was she had also seen the festival on board ship and she told them where the prince came from and where his palace stood 
 
 come little sister said the other princesses then they 
 entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the 
 water close by the spot where they knew the palace stood it 
 was built of bright yellow shining stone with long flights of 
 marble steps one of which reached quite down to the sea splendid 
 gilded cupolas rose over the roof and between the pillars that 
 surrounded the whole building stood statues of marble 
 
 through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble 
 rooms with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry while the 
 walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to 
 look at in the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its 
 sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling through 
 which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful 
 plants growing round the basin of the fountain now that she knew 
 where he lived she spent many an evening and many a night on the 
 water near the palace she would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony which threw a broad shadow on the water here she would sit and watch the young prince who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight she saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat with music playing and flags waving she peeped out from among the green rushes and if the wind caught her long veil those who saw it believed it to be a swan spreading out its wings on many a night too when the fishermen with their torches were out at sea she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about on the waves and she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom and how heartily she had kissed him but he knew nothing of all this and could not even dream of her she grew more and more fond of human beings and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own 
 
 they could fly over the sea in ships and mount the high hills which 
 were far above the clouds and the lands they possessed their woods 
 and their fields stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight 
 
 there was so much that she wished to know and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions then she applied to her old 
 grandmother who knew all about the upper world which she very 
 rightly called the lands above the sea 
 
 if human beings are not drowned asked the little mermaid 
 
 can they live forever do they never die as we do here in the sea 
 
 yes replied the old lady they must also die and their term 
 of life is even shorter than ours we sometimes live to three 
 hundred years but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water and we have not even a grave down here of those we love we have not immortal souls we shall never live again but like the green when once it has been cut off we can never flourish more human beings on the contrary have a soul which lives forever lives after the body has been turned to dust 
 
 it rises up through the clear pure air beyond the glittering stars 
 as we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth 
 so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never 
 see 
 
 why have not we an immortal soul asked the little mermaid 
 mournfully i would give gladly all the hundreds of years that i have 
 to live to be a human being only for one day and to have the hope of 
 knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars 
 
 you must not think of that said the old woman we feel 
 ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings 
 
 so i shall die said the little mermaid and as the foam of the 
 sea i shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the 
 waves or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun is there anything 
 i can do to win an immortal soul 
 
 no said the old woman unless a man were to love you so much 
 that you were more to him than his father or mother and if all his 
 thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you and the priest placed 
 his right hand in yours and he promised to be true to you here and 
 hereafter then his soul would glide into your body and you would 
 obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind he would give a 
 soul to you and retain his own as well but this can never happen 
 your tail which amongst us is considered so beautiful is 
 thought on earth to be quite ugly they do not know any better and 
 they think it necessary to have two stout props which they call legs 
 in order to be handsome 
 
 then the little mermaid sighed and looked sorrowfully at her 
 tail let us be happy said the old lady and dart and 
 spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live 
 which is really quite long enough after that we can rest ourselves 
 all the better this evening we are going to have a court ball 
 
 it is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on 
 earth the walls and the ceiling of the large were of thick 
 but transparent crystal may hundreds of colossal shells some of a 
 deep red others of a grass green stood on each side in rows with 
 blue fire in them which lighted up the whole saloon and shone 
 through the walls so that the sea was also illuminated innumerable 
 fishes great and small swam past the crystal walls on some of 
 them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy and on others they 
 shone like silver and gold through the halls flowed a broad stream 
 and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing no one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs 
 
 the little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all the whole court 
 applauded her with hands and tails and for a moment her heart felt 
 quite gay for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or 
 in the sea but she soon thought again of the world above her for she 
 could not forget the charming prince nor her sorrow that she had 
 not an immortal soul like his therefore she crept away silently out 
 of her palace and while everything within was gladness and 
 song she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone then she 
 heard the bugle sounding through the water and thought he is 
 certainly sailing above he on whom my wishes depend and in whose 
 hands i should like to place the happiness of my life i will 
 venture all for him and to win an immortal soul while my sisters are 
 dancing in my palace i will go to the sea witch of whom i 
 have always been so much afraid but she can give me counsel and 
 help 
 
 and then the little mermaid went out from her garden and took the 
 road to the foaming whirlpools behind which the sorceress lived 
 she had never been that way before neither flowers nor grass grew 
 there nothing but bare gray sandy ground stretched out to the 
 whirlpool where the water like foaming whirled round 
 everything that it seized and cast it into the fathomless deep 
 through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid 
 was obliged to pass to reach the dominions of the sea witch and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm bubbling mire called by the witch her turfmoor beyond this stood her house in the centre of a strange forest in which all the trees and flowers were polypi half animals and half plants they looked like 
 serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground the 
 branches were long slimy arms with fingers like flexible worms 
 moving limb after limb from the root to the top all that could be 
 reached in the sea they seized upon and held fast so that it never 
 escaped from their clutches the little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw that she stood still and her heart beat with fear and she was very nearly turning back but she thought of the prince and of the human soul for which she longed and her courage returned she fastened her long flowing hair round her head so that the polypi 
 might not seize hold of it she laid her hands together across her 
 bosom and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi which were stretched out on each side of her she saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms as if they were iron bands the white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea and had sunk down into the deep waters skeletons of land animals oars rudders and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms even a little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled and this seemed the most shocking of all to the 
 little princess 
 
 she now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood where large 
 fat were rolling in the mire and showing their ugly 
 bodies in the midst of this spot stood a house built 
 with the bones of shipwrecked human beings there sat the sea witch 
 allowing a toad to eat from her mouth just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar she called the ugly her 
 little chickens and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom 
 
 i know what you want said the sea witch it is very stupid 
 of you but you shall have your way and it will bring you to 
 sorrow my pretty princess you want to get rid of your tail 
 and to have two supports instead of it like human beings on earth so 
 that the young prince may fall in love with you and that you may have 
 an immortal soul and then the witch laughed so loud and 
 disgustingly that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground and lay 
 there wriggling about you are but just in time said the witch 
 for after sunrise i should not be able to help you till the 
 end of another year i will prepare a draught for you with which 
 you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise and sit down on the 
 shore and drink it your tail will then disappear and shrink up 
 into what mankind calls legs and you will feel great pain as if a 
 sword were passing through you but all who see you will say that 
 you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw you will still 
 have the same floating gracefulness of movement and no dancer will 
 ever tread so lightly but at every step you take it will feel as if 
 you were treading upon sharp knives and that the blood must flow 
 if you will bear all this i will help you 
 
 yes i will said the little princess in a trembling voice as 
 she thought of the prince and the immortal soul 
 
 but think again said the witch for when once your shape has 
 become like a human being you can no more be a mermaid you will 
 never return through the water to your sisters or to your 
 palace again and if you do not win the love of the prince so that he 
 is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake and to 
 love you with his whole soul and allow the priest to join your 
 hands that you may be man and wife then you will never have an 
 immortal soul the first morning after he marries another your heart 
 will break and you will become foam on the crest of the waves 
 i will do it said the little mermaid and she became pale as 
 death 
 
 but i must be paid also said the witch and it is not a trifle 
 that i ask you have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the 
 depths of the sea and you believe that you will be able to charm 
 the prince with it also but this voice you must give to me the 
 best thing you possess will i have for the price of my draught my own blood must be mixed with it that it may be as sharp as a sword 
 
 but if you take away my voice said the little mermaid what is 
 left for me 
 
 your beautiful form your graceful walk and your expressive 
 eyes surely with these you can enchain a heart well have 
 you lost your courage put out your little tongue that i may cut it 
 off as my payment then you shall have the powerful draught 
 
 it shall be said the little mermaid then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire to prepare the magic draught 
 
 cleanliness is a good thing said she scouring the vessel 
 with snakes which she had tied together in a large knot then she 
 pricked herself in the breast and let the black blood drop into it 
 the steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no 
 one could look at them without fear every moment the witch threw 
 something else into the vessel and when it began to boil the sound 
 was like the weeping of a crocodile when at last the magic draught 
 was ready it looked like the clearest water there it is for you 
 said the witch then she cut off the tongue so that she 
 became dumb and would never again speak or sing if the polypi 
 should seize hold of you as you return through the wood said the 
 witch throw over them a few drops of the potion and their fingers 
 will be torn into a thousand pieces but the little mermaid had no 
 occasion to do this for the polypi sprang back in terror when they 
 caught sight of the glittering draught which shone in her hand like a 
 twinkling star 
 
 so she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh and 
 between the rushing whirlpools she saw that in her palace 
 the torches in the ballroom were extinguished and all within 
 asleep but she did not venture to go in to them for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever she felt as if her heart would break 
 
 she stole into the garden took a flower from the of 
 each of her sisters kissed her hand a thousand times towards the 
 palace and then rose up through the dark blue waters the sun had not risen when she came in sight of the palace and approached the beautiful marble steps but the moon shone clear and bright 
 then the little mermaid drank the magic draught and it seemed as if a 
 sword went through her delicate body she fell into a swoon and lay like one dead when the sun arose and shone over the sea she recovered and felt a sharp pain but just before her stood the 
 handsome young prince he fixed his eyes upon her so 
 earnestly that she cast down her own and then became aware that her 
 tail was gone and that she had as pretty a pair of white 
 legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have but she had no 
 clothes so she wrapped herself in her long thick hair the prince 
 asked her who she was and where she came from and she looked at 
 him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes but she could 
 not speak every step she took was as the witch had said it would 
 be she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp 
 knives but she bore it willingly and stepped as lightly by the 
 side as a so that he and all who saw her 
 wondered at her movements she was very soon 
 arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin and was the most beautiful 
 creature in the palace but she was dumb and could neither speak 
 nor sing 
 
 beautiful female slaves dressed in silk and gold stepped forward 
 and sang before the prince and his royal parents one sang better than 
 all the others and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her 
 this was great sorrow to the little mermaid she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once and she thought oh if he 
 could only know that i have given away my voice forever to be with 
 him 
 
 the slaves next performed some pretty dances to the 
 sound of beautiful music then the little mermaid raised her lovely 
 white arms stood on the tips of her toes and glided over the 
 floor and danced as no one yet had been able to dance at each moment her beauty became more revealed and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves every one was enchanted especially the prince who called her his little foundling and she danced again quite readily to please him though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives 
 the prince said she should remain with him always and she 
 received permission to sleep at his door on a velvet cushion he 
 had a dress made for her that she might accompany him on 
 horseback they rode together through the woods where the green boughs touched their shoulders and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves she climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains and although her tender feet bled so that even her 
 steps were marked she only laughed and followed him till they 
 could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds 
 travelling to distant lands while at the palace and when 
 all the household were asleep she would go and sit on the broad 
 marble steps for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the 
 cold and then she thought of all those below in the deep 
 once during the night her sisters came up singing 
 sorrowfully as they floated on the water she beckoned to them and 
 then they recognized her and told her how she had grieved them 
 after that they came to the same place every night and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years and the old sea king her father with his crown on his head they stretched out their hands towards her but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did 
 
 as the days passed she loved the prince more fondly and he loved 
 her as he would love a little child but it never came into his head 
 to make her his wife yet unless he married her she could not 
 receive an immortal soul and on the morning after his marriage 
 with another she would dissolve into the foam of the sea 
 
 do you not love me the best of them all the eyes of the 
 little mermaid seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her fair forehead 
 
 yes you are dear to me said the prince for you have the best 
 heart and you are the most devoted to me you are like a young maiden whom i once saw but whom i shall never meet again i was in a ship that was wrecked and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple where several young maidens performed the service the youngest of them found me on the shore and saved my life i saw her but twice and she is the only one in the world whom i could love but you are like her and you have almost driven her image out of my mind she belongs to the holy temple and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her and we will never part 
 
 ah he knows not that it was i who saved his life thought the 
 little mermaid i carried him over the sea to the wood where the 
 temple stands i sat beneath the foam and watched till the human 
 beings came to help him i saw the pretty maiden that he loves 
 better than he loves me and the mermaid sighed deeply but she could not shed tears he says the maiden belongs to the holy temple 
 therefore she will never return to the world they will meet no 
 more while i am by his side and see him every day i will take 
 care of him and love him and give up my life for his sake 
 
 very soon it was said that the prince must marry and that the 
 beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife for a fine 
 ship was being fitted out although the prince gave out that he merely 
 intended to pay a visit to the king it was generally supposed that he 
 really went to see his daughter a great company were to go with 
 him the little mermaid smiled and shook her head she knew the 
 thoughts better than any of the others 
 
 i must travel he had said to her i must see this beautiful 
 princess my parents desire it but they will not oblige me to bring 
 her home as my bride i cannot love her she is not like the beautiful 
 maiden in the temple whom you resemble if i were forced to choose 
 a bride i would rather choose you my dumb foundling with those 
 expressive eyes and then he kissed her rosy mouth played with her 
 long waving hair and laid his head on her heart while she dreamed of 
 human happiness and an immortal soul you are not afraid of the 
 sea my dumb child said he as they stood on the deck of the noble 
 ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king 
 and then he told her of storm and of calm of strange fishes in the 
 deep beneath them and of what the divers had seen there and she 
 smiled at his descriptions for she knew better than any one what 
 wonders were at the bottom of the sea 
 
 in the moonlight when all on board were asleep excepting the man 
 at the helm who was steering she sat on the deck gazing down 
 through the clear water she thought she could distinguish her 
 castle and upon it her aged grandmother with the silver 
 crown on her head looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the 
 vessel then her sisters came up on the waves and gazed at her 
 mournfully wringing their white hands she beckoned to them and 
 smiled and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was but 
 the approached and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw 
 
 the next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful 
 town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit the 
 church bells were ringing and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets and soldiers with flying colors and glittering bayonets lined the rocks through which they passed every day was a festival balls and entertainments followed one another 
 
 but the princess had not yet appeared people said that she was 
 being brought up and educated in a religious house where she was 
 learning every royal virtue at last she came then the little 
 mermaid who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty her skin was delicately fair and beneath her long dark her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity 
 
 it was you said the prince who saved my life when i lay 
 dead on the beach and he folded his blushing bride in his arms oh i am too happy said he to the little mermaid my fondest hopes are all fulfilled you will rejoice at my happiness for your devotion to me is great and sincere 
 
 the little mermaid kissed his hand and felt as if her heart 
 were already broken his wedding morning would bring death to her and she would change into the foam of the sea all the church bells 
 rung and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal 
 perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar the 
 priests waved the censers while the bride and bridegroom joined their 
 hands and received the blessing of the bishop the little mermaid 
 dressed in silk and gold held up the train but her ears 
 heard nothing of the festive music and her eyes saw not the holy 
 ceremony she thought of the night of death which was coming to her 
 and of all she had lost in the world on the same evening the bride 
 and bridegroom went on board ship cannons were roaring flags waving and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected it contained elegant couches for the reception of the bridal pair during the night the ship with swelling sails and a 
 favorable wind glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea 
 when it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit and the 
 sailors danced merrily on the deck the little mermaid could not 
 help thinking of her first rising out of the sea when she had seen 
 similar festivities and joys and she joined in the dance poised 
 herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey and all 
 present cheered her with wonder she had never danced so elegantly 
 before her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives but she 
 cared not for it a sharper pang had pierced through her heart she 
 knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince for 
 whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home she had given up her beautiful voice and suffered pain daily for him while 
 he knew nothing of it this was the last evening that she would 
 breathe the same air with him or gaze on the starry sky and the 
 deep sea an eternal night without a thought or a dream awaited her 
 she had no soul and now she could never win one all was joy and 
 gayety on board ship till long after midnight she laughed and 
 danced with the rest while the thoughts of death were in her heart 
 the prince kissed his beautiful bride while she played with his raven 
 hair till they went to rest in the splendid tent then all 
 became still on board the ship the helmsman alone awake stood at 
 the helm the little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of 
 the vessel and looked towards the east for the first blush of 
 morning for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death she 
 saw her sisters rising out of the flood they were as pale as herself 
 but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind and had 
 been cut off 
 
 we have given our hair to the witch said they to obtain 
 help for you that you may not die she has given us a knife 
 here it is see it is very sharp before the sun rises you must plunge 
 it into the heart of the prince when the warm blood falls upon your 
 feet they will grow together again and form into a tail and 
 you will be once more a mermaid and return to us to live out your 
 three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea 
 foam haste then he or you must die before sunrise our old 
 grandmother moans so for you that her white hair is falling off 
 from sorrow as ours fell under the scissors kill the 
 prince and come back hasten do you not see the first red streaks 
 in the sky in a few minutes the sun will rise and you must die and 
 then they sighed deeply and mournfully and sank down beneath the 
 waves 
 
 the little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent 
 and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the 
 breast she bent down and kissed his fair brow then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter then she glanced at the sharp knife and again fixed her eyes on the prince who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams she was in his thoughts and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid then she flung it far away from her into the waves the water turned red where it fell and the drops that spurted up looked like blood she cast one more lingering glance at the prince and then threw herself from the ship into the sea and thought her body was 
 dissolving into foam the sun rose above the waves and his warm 
 rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid who did not feel 
 as if she were dying she saw the bright sun and all around her 
 floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings she could see 
 through them the white sails of the ship and the red clouds in the 
 sky their speech was melodious but too ethereal to be heard by 
 mortal ears as they were also unseen by mortal eyes the little 
 mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs and that she 
 continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam where am i 
 asked she and her voice sounded ethereal as the voice of those who 
 were with her no earthly music could imitate it 
 
 among the daughters of the air answered one of them a mermaid 
 has not an immortal soul nor can she obtain one unless she wins the 
 love of a human being on the power of another hangs her eternal 
 destiny but the daughters of the air although they do not possess an 
 immortal soul can by their good deeds procure one for themselves 
 we fly to warm countries and cool the sultry air that destroys 
 mankind with the pestilence we carry the perfume of the flowers to 
 spread health and restoration after we have striven for three hundred 
 years to all the good in our power we receive an immortal soul and 
 take part in the happiness of mankind you poor little mermaid 
 have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing you have 
 suffered and endured and raised yourself to the by your 
 good deeds and now by striving for three hundred years in the same 
 way you may obtain an immortal soul 
 
 the little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun 
 and felt them for the first time filling with tears on the ship in 
 which she had left the prince there were life and noise she saw 
 him and his beautiful bride searching for her sorrowfully they 
 gazed at the pearly foam as if they knew she had thrown herself 
 into the waves unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride and 
 fanned the prince and then mounted with the other children of the air 
 to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether 
 
 after three hundred years thus shall we float into the kingdom 
 of heaven said she and we may even get there sooner whispered 
 one of her companions unseen we can enter the houses of men where there are children and for every day on which we find a good child who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love our time of probation is shortened the child does not know when we fly through the room that we smile with joy at his good conduct for we can count one year less of our three hundred years but when we see a naughty or a wicked child we shed tears of sorrow and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the little mermaid 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far out in the ocean where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal it is very very deep so deep indeed that no cable could fathom it many church steeples piled one upon another would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above there dwell the sea king and his subjects we must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand no indeed the most singular flowers and plants grow there the leaves and stems of which are so pliant that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life fishes both large and small glide between the branches as birds fly among the trees here upon land in the deepest spot of all stands the castle of the sea king 
 
 its walls are built of coral and the long gothic windows are of 
 the clearest amber the roof is formed of shells that open and 
 close as the water flows over them their appearance is very 
 beautiful for in each lies a glittering pearl which would be fit for 
 the diadem of a queen 
 
 the sea king had been a widower for many years and his aged 
 mother kept house for him she was a very wise woman and 
 exceedingly proud of her high birth on that account she wore twelve 
 oysters on her tail while others also of high rank were only 
 allowed to wear six she was however deserving of very great praise especially for her care of the little her 
 they were six beautiful children but the youngest 
 was the prettiest of them all her skin was as clear and delicate as a 
 and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea but like all 
 the others she had no feet and her body ended in a tail 
 
 all day long they played in the great halls of the castle or among 
 the living flowers that grew out of the walls the large amber windows 
 were open and the fish swam in just as the swallows fly into our 
 houses when we open the windows excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses ate out of their hands and allowed themselves to be stroked outside the castle there was a beautiful garden in 
 which grew bright red and dark blue flowers and blossoms like 
 flames of fire the fruit glittered like gold and the leaves and 
 stems waved to and fro continually the earth itself was the finest 
 sand but blue as the flame of burning sulphur over everything lay 
 a peculiar blue radiance as if it were surrounded by the air from 
 above through which the blue sky shone instead of the dark depths of the sea in calm weather the sun could be seen looking like a 
 purple flower with the light streaming from the calyx each of the 
 young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden where 
 she might dig and plant as she pleased one arranged her 
 into the form of a whale another thought it better to make hers 
 like the figure of a little mermaid but that of the youngest was 
 round like the sun and contained flowers as red as his rays at 
 sunset she was a strange child quiet and thoughtful and while her 
 sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they 
 obtained from the wrecks of vessels she cared for nothing but her 
 pretty red flowers like the sun excepting a beautiful marble statue 
 it was the representation of a handsome boy carved out of pure 
 white stone which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck 
 
 she planted by the statue a weeping willow it grew 
 splendidly and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue 
 almost down to the blue sands the shadow had a violet tint and waved to and fro like the branches it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play and trying to kiss each other nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea 
 she made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns the people and the animals to her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance and not those below the sea that the trees of the forest should be green and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly that it was quite a pleasure to hear them her grandmother 
 called the little birds fishes or she would not have understood 
 her for she had never seen birds 
 
 when you have reached your fifteenth year said the 
 you will have permission to rise up out of the sea 
 to sit on the rocks in the moonlight while the great ships are 
 sailing by and then you will see both forests and towns 
 
 in the following year one of the sisters would be fifteen but as 
 each was a year younger than the other the youngest would have to 
 wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the 
 ocean and see the earth as we do however each promised to tell 
 the others what she saw on her first visit and what she thought the 
 most beautiful for their grandmother could not tell them enough 
 there were so many things on which they wanted information none of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest she who had the longest time to wait and who was so quiet and thoughtful 
 
 many nights she stood by the open window looking up through the 
 dark blue water and watching the fish as they splashed about with 
 their fins and tails she could see the moon and stars shining 
 faintly but through the water they looked larger than they do to 
 our eyes when something like a black cloud passed between her and 
 them she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head or a ship full of human beings who never imagined that a pretty little 
 mermaid was standing beneath them holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship 
 
 as soon as the eldest was fifteen she was allowed to rise to 
 the surface of the ocean when she came back she had hundreds of 
 things to talk about but the most beautiful she said was to lie 
 in the moonlight on a sandbank in the quiet sea near the coast and 
 to gaze on a large town nearby where the lights were twinkling like 
 hundreds of stars to listen to the sounds of the music the noise 
 of carriages and the voices of human beings and then to hear the 
 merry bells peal out from the church steeples and because she could 
 not go near to all those wonderful things she longed for them more 
 than ever oh did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all these 
 descriptions and afterwards when she stood at the open window 
 looking up through the dark blue water she thought of the great city 
 with all its bustle and noise and even fancied she could hear the 
 sound of the church bells down in the depths of the sea 
 in another year the second sister received permission to rise to 
 the surface of the water and to swim about where she pleased she 
 rose just as the sun was setting and this she said was the most 
 beautiful sight of all the whole sky looked like gold while violet 
 and clouds which she could not describe floated over 
 her and still more rapidly than the clouds flew a large flock of 
 wild swans towards the setting sun looking like a long white veil 
 across the sea she also swam towards the sun but it sunk into the 
 waves and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea 
 
 the third turn followed she was the boldest of them all 
 and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea on the 
 banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines palaces and 
 castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest she 
 heard the birds singing and the rays of the sun were so powerful that 
 she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face in a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children quite naked and sporting about in the water she wanted to play with them but they fled in a great fright and then a 
 little black animal came to the water it was a dog but she did not 
 know that for she had never before seen one this animal barked at 
 her so terribly that she became frightened and rushed back to the 
 open sea but she said she should never forget the beautiful forest 
 the green hills and the pretty little children who could swim in 
 the water although they had not tails 
 
 the fourth sister was more timid she remained in the midst of the 
 sea but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the 
 land she could see for so many miles around her and the sky above 
 looked like a bell of glass she had seen the ships but at such a 
 great distance that they looked like the dolphins sported 
 in the waves and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils 
 till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every 
 direction 
 the fifth birthday occurred in the winter so when her 
 turn came she saw what the others had not seen the first time they 
 went up the sea looked quite green and large icebergs were 
 floating about each like a pearl she said but larger and loftier 
 than the churches built by men they were of the most singular shapes 
 and glittered like diamonds she had seated herself upon one of the 
 largest and let the wind play with her long hair and she remarked 
 that all the ships sailed by rapidly and steered as far away as 
 they could from the iceberg as if they were afraid of it towards 
 evening as the sun went down dark clouds covered the sky the 
 thunder rolled and the lightning flashed and the red light glowed 
 on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea on all 
 the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling while she sat 
 calmly on the floating iceberg watching the blue lightning as it 
 darted its forked flashes into the sea 
 
 when first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface they 
 were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw but 
 now as girls they could go when they pleased and they 
 had become indifferent about it they wished themselves back again 
 in the water and after a month had passed they said it was much 
 more beautiful down below and pleasanter to be at home yet often in the evening hours the five sisters would twine their arms round 
 each other and rise to the surface in a row they had more beautiful 
 voices than any human being could have and before the approach of a storm and when they expected a ship would be lost they swam before the vessel and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom but the sailors could not understand the song they took it for the howling of the storm and these things were never to be 
 beautiful for them for if the ship sank the men were drowned and 
 their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the sea king 
 
 when the sisters rose through the water in this 
 way their youngest sister would stand quite alone looking after 
 them ready to cry only that the mermaids have no tears and 
 therefore they suffer more oh were i but fifteen years old said 
 she i know that i shall love the world up there and all the 
 people who live in it 
 
 at last she reached her fifteenth year well now you are 
 grown up said the old dowager her grandmother so you must let 
 me adorn you like your other sisters and she placed a wreath of 
 white lilies in her hair and every flower leaf was half a pearl then 
 the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the 
 tail of the princess to show her high rank 
 
 but they hurt me so said the little mermaid 
 
 pride must suffer pain replied the old lady oh how gladly she 
 would have shaken off all this grandeur and laid aside the heavy 
 wreath the red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better but she could not help herself so she said farewell and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water the sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty the sea was calm and the air mild and fresh a large ship with three masts lay becalmed on the water with only one sail set for not a breeze stiffed and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging there was music and song on board and as darkness came on a hundred colored lanterns were lighted as if the flags of all nations waved in the air the little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows and now and then as the waves lifted her up she could look in through clear glass and see a number of people within 
 among them was a young prince the most beautiful of all with large black eyes he was sixteen years of age and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing the sailors were dancing on deck but when the prince came out of the cabin more than a hundred rockets rose in 
 the air making it as bright as day the little mermaid was so 
 startled that she dived under water and when she again stretched 
 out her head it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling 
 around her she had never seen such fireworks before great suns 
 spurted fire about splendid fireflies flew into the blue air and 
 everything was reflected in the clear calm sea beneath the ship 
 itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people and even the 
 smallest rope could be distinctly and plainly seen and how 
 handsome the young prince looked as he pressed the hands of all 
 present and smiled at them while the music resounded through the 
 clear night air 
 
 it was very late yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes 
 from the ship or from the beautiful prince the colored lanterns 
 had been extinguished no more rockets rose in the air and the cannon had ceased firing but the sea became restless and a moaning 
 grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves still the little 
 mermaid remained by the cabin window rocking up and down on the 
 water which enabled her to look in after a while the sails were 
 quickly unfurled and the noble ship continued her passage but soon 
 the waves rose higher heavy clouds darkened the sky and lightning 
 appeared in the distance a dreadful storm was approaching once 
 more the sails were reefed and the great ship pursued her flying 
 course over the raging sea the waves rose mountains high as if 
 they would have overtopped the mast but the ship dived like a swan 
 between them and then rose again on their lofty foaming crests to 
 the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport not so to the 
 sailors at length the ship groaned and creaked the thick planks gave 
 way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck the 
 mainmast snapped asunder like a reed the ship lay over on her side 
 and the water rushed in the little mermaid now perceived that the 
 crew were in danger even she herself was obliged to be careful to 
 avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the 
 water at one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a 
 single object but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene 
 she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince 
 when the ship parted she had seen him sink into the deep waves and 
 she was glad for she thought he would now be with her and then she 
 remembered that human beings could not live in the water so that when he got down to her palace he would be quite dead but he must not die so she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea forgetting that they could crush her to pieces then she dived deeply under the dark waters rising and 
 falling with the waves till at length she managed to reach the 
 young prince who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea his limbs were failing him his beautiful eyes were closed and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his 
 assistance she held his head above the water and let the waves drift 
 them where they would 
 
 in the morning the storm had ceased but of the ship not a 
 single fragment could be seen the sun rose up red and glowing from 
 the water and its beams brought back the hue of health to the 
 cheeks but his eyes remained closed the mermaid kissed 
 his high smooth forehead and stroked back his wet hair he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden and she kissed him 
 again and wished that he might live presently they came in sight 
 of land she saw lofty blue mountains on which the white snow 
 rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them near the coast 
 were beautiful green forests and close by stood a large building 
 whether a church or a convent she could not tell orange and citron 
 trees grew in the garden and before the door stood lofty palms the 
 sea here formed a little bay in which the water was quite still 
 but very deep so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach 
 which was covered with fine white sand and there she laid him in the 
 warm sunshine taking care to raise his head higher than his body 
 
 then bells sounded in the large white building and a number of 
 young girls came into the garden the little mermaid swam out 
 farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen and watched to see what would become of the poor prince she did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay 
 she seemed frightened at first but only for a moment then she fetched a number of people and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again and smiled upon those who stood round him but to her he sent no smile he knew not that she had saved him this made her very unhappy and when he was led away into the great building she dived down sorrowfully into the water and returned to her castle she had always been silent and thoughtful and now she was more so than ever her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water but she would tell them nothing many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince she saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away but she never saw the prince and therefore she returned home always more sorrowful than before it was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince but she gave up tending her flowers and they grew in wild confusion over the paths twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees so that the whole place became dark and gloomy at length she could bear it no longer and told one of her sisters all about it then the others heard the secret and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was she had also seen the festival on board ship and she told them where the prince came from and where his palace stood 
 
 come little sister said the other princesses then they 
 entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the 
 water close by the spot where they knew the palace stood it 
 was built of bright yellow shining stone with long flights of 
 marble steps one of which reached quite down to the sea splendid 
 gilded cupolas rose over the roof and between the pillars that 
 surrounded the whole building stood statues of marble 
 
 through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble 
 rooms with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry while the 
 walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to 
 look at in the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its 
 sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling through 
 which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful 
 plants growing round the basin of the fountain now that she knew 
 where he lived she spent many an evening and many a night on the 
 water near the palace she would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony which threw a broad shadow on the water here she would sit and watch the young prince who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight she saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat with music playing and flags waving she peeped out from among the green rushes and if the wind caught her long veil those who saw it believed it to be a swan spreading out its wings on many a night too when the fishermen with their torches were out at sea she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about on the waves and she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom and how heartily she had kissed him but he knew nothing of all this and could not even dream of her she grew more and more fond of human beings and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own 
 
 they could fly over the sea in ships and mount the high hills which 
 were far above the clouds and the lands they possessed their woods 
 and their fields stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight 
 
 there was so much that she wished to know and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions then she applied to her old 
 grandmother who knew all about the upper world which she very 
 rightly called the lands above the sea 
 
 if human beings are not drowned asked the little mermaid 
 
 can they live forever do they never die as we do here in the sea 
 
 yes replied the old lady they must also die and their term 
 of life is even shorter than ours we sometimes live to three 
 hundred years but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water and we have not even a grave down here of those we love we have not immortal souls we shall never live again but like the green when once it has been cut off we can never flourish more human beings on the contrary have a soul which lives forever lives after the body has been turned to dust 
 
 it rises up through the clear pure air beyond the glittering stars 
 as we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth 
 so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never 
 see 
 
 why have not we an immortal soul asked the little mermaid 
 mournfully i would give gladly all the hundreds of years that i have 
 to live to be a human being only for one day and to have the hope of 
 knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars 
 
 you must not think of that said the old woman we feel 
 ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings 
 
 so i shall die said the little mermaid and as the foam of the 
 sea i shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the 
 waves or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun is there anything 
 i can do to win an immortal soul 
 
 no said the old woman unless a man were to love you so much 
 that you were more to him than his father or mother and if all his 
 thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you and the priest placed 
 his right hand in yours and he promised to be true to you here and 
 hereafter then his soul would glide into your body and you would 
 obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind he would give a 
 soul to you and retain his own as well but this can never happen 
 your tail which amongst us is considered so beautiful is 
 thought on earth to be quite ugly they do not know any better and 
 they think it necessary to have two stout props which they call legs 
 in order to be handsome 
 
 then the little mermaid sighed and looked sorrowfully at her 
 tail let us be happy said the old lady and dart and 
 spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live 
 which is really quite long enough after that we can rest ourselves 
 all the better this evening we are going to have a court ball 
 
 it is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on 
 earth the walls and the ceiling of the large were of thick 
 but transparent crystal may hundreds of colossal shells some of a 
 deep red others of a grass green stood on each side in rows with 
 blue fire in them which lighted up the whole saloon and shone 
 through the walls so that the sea was also illuminated innumerable 
 fishes great and small swam past the crystal walls on some of 
 them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy and on others they 
 shone like silver and gold through the halls flowed a broad stream 
 and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing no one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs 
 
 the little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all the whole court 
 applauded her with hands and tails and for a moment her heart felt 
 quite gay for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or 
 in the sea but she soon thought again of the world above her for she 
 could not forget the charming prince nor her sorrow that she had 
 not an immortal soul like his therefore she crept away silently out 
 of her palace and while everything within was gladness and 
 song she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone then she 
 heard the bugle sounding through the water and thought he is 
 certainly sailing above he on whom my wishes depend and in whose 
 hands i should like to place the happiness of my life i will 
 venture all for him and to win an immortal soul while my sisters are 
 dancing in my palace i will go to the sea witch of whom i 
 have always been so much afraid but she can give me counsel and 
 help 
 
 and then the little mermaid went out from her garden and took the 
 road to the foaming whirlpools behind which the sorceress lived 
 she had never been that way before neither flowers nor grass grew 
 there nothing but bare gray sandy ground stretched out to the 
 whirlpool where the water like foaming whirled round 
 everything that it seized and cast it into the fathomless deep 
 through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid 
 was obliged to pass to reach the dominions of the sea witch and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm bubbling mire called by the witch her turfmoor beyond this stood her house in the centre of a strange forest in which all the trees and flowers were polypi half animals and half plants they looked like 
 serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground the 
 branches were long slimy arms with fingers like flexible worms 
 moving limb after limb from the root to the top all that could be 
 reached in the sea they seized upon and held fast so that it never 
 escaped from their clutches the little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw that she stood still and her heart beat with fear and she was very nearly turning back but she thought of the prince and of the human soul for which she longed and her courage returned she fastened her long flowing hair round her head so that the polypi 
 might not seize hold of it she laid her hands together across her 
 bosom and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi which were stretched out on each side of her she saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms as if they were iron bands the white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea and had sunk down into the deep waters skeletons of land animals oars rudders and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms even a little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled and this seemed the most shocking of all to the 
 little princess 
 
 she now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood where large 
 fat were rolling in the mire and showing their ugly 
 bodies in the midst of this spot stood a house built 
 with the bones of shipwrecked human beings there sat the sea witch 
 allowing a toad to eat from her mouth just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar she called the ugly her 
 little chickens and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom 
 
 i know what you want said the sea witch it is very stupid 
 of you but you shall have your way and it will bring you to 
 sorrow my pretty princess you want to get rid of your tail 
 and to have two supports instead of it like human beings on earth so 
 that the young prince may fall in love with you and that you may have 
 an immortal soul and then the witch laughed so loud and 
 disgustingly that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground and lay 
 there wriggling about you are but just in time said the witch 
 for after sunrise i should not be able to help you till the 
 end of another year i will prepare a draught for you with which 
 you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise and sit down on the 
 shore and drink it your tail will then disappear and shrink up 
 into what mankind calls legs and you will feel great pain as if a 
 sword were passing through you but all who see you will say that 
 you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw you will still 
 have the same floating gracefulness of movement and no dancer will 
 ever tread so lightly but at every step you take it will feel as if 
 you were treading upon sharp knives and that the blood must flow 
 if you will bear all this i will help you 
 
 yes i will said the little princess in a trembling voice as 
 she thought of the prince and the immortal soul 
 
 but think again said the witch for when once your shape has 
 become like a human being you can no more be a mermaid you will 
 never return through the water to your sisters or to your 
 palace again and if you do not win the love of the prince so that he 
 is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake and to 
 love you with his whole soul and allow the priest to join your 
 hands that you may be man and wife then you will never have an 
 immortal soul the first morning after he marries another your heart 
 will break and you will become foam on the crest of the waves 
 i will do it said the little mermaid and she became pale as 
 death 
 
 but i must be paid also said the witch and it is not a trifle 
 that i ask you have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the 
 depths of the sea and you believe that you will be able to charm 
 the prince with it also but this voice you must give to me the 
 best thing you possess will i have for the price of my draught my own blood must be mixed with it that it may be as sharp as a sword 
 
 but if you take away my voice said the little mermaid what is 
 left for me 
 
 your beautiful form your graceful walk and your expressive 
 eyes surely with these you can enchain a heart well have 
 you lost your courage put out your little tongue that i may cut it 
 off as my payment then you shall have the powerful draught 
 
 it shall be said the little mermaid then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire to prepare the magic draught 
 
 cleanliness is a good thing said she scouring the vessel 
 with snakes which she had tied together in a large knot then she 
 pricked herself in the breast and let the black blood drop into it 
 the steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no 
 one could look at them without fear every moment the witch threw 
 something else into the vessel and when it began to boil the sound 
 was like the weeping of a crocodile when at last the magic draught 
 was ready it looked like the clearest water there it is for you 
 said the witch then she cut off the tongue so that she 
 became dumb and would never again speak or sing if the polypi 
 should seize hold of you as you return through the wood said the 
 witch throw over them a few drops of the potion and their fingers 
 will be torn into a thousand pieces but the little mermaid had no 
 occasion to do this for the polypi sprang back in terror when they 
 caught sight of the glittering draught which shone in her hand like a 
 twinkling star 
 
 so she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh and 
 between the rushing whirlpools she saw that in her palace 
 the torches in the ballroom were extinguished and all within 
 asleep but she did not venture to go in to them for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever she felt as if her heart would break 
 
 she stole into the garden took a flower from the of 
 each of her sisters kissed her hand a thousand times towards the 
 palace and then rose up through the dark blue waters the sun had not risen when she came in sight of the palace and approached the beautiful marble steps but the moon shone clear and bright 
 then the little mermaid drank the magic draught and it seemed as if a 
 sword went through her delicate body she fell into a swoon and lay like one dead when the sun arose and shone over the sea she recovered and felt a sharp pain but just before her stood the 
 handsome young prince he fixed his eyes upon her so 
 earnestly that she cast down her own and then became aware that her 
 tail was gone and that she had as pretty a pair of white 
 legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have but she had no 
 clothes so she wrapped herself in her long thick hair the prince 
 asked her who she was and where she came from and she looked at 
 him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes but she could 
 not speak every step she took was as the witch had said it would 
 be she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp 
 knives but she bore it willingly and stepped as lightly by the 
 side as a so that he and all who saw her 
 wondered at her movements she was very soon 
 arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin and was the most beautiful 
 creature in the palace but she was dumb and could neither speak 
 nor sing 
 
 beautiful female slaves dressed in silk and gold stepped forward 
 and sang before the prince and his royal parents one sang better than 
 all the others and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her 
 this was great sorrow to the little mermaid she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once and she thought oh if he 
 could only know that i have given away my voice forever to be with 
 him 
 
 the slaves next performed some pretty dances to the 
 sound of beautiful music then the little mermaid raised her lovely 
 white arms stood on the tips of her toes and glided over the 
 floor and danced as no one yet had been able to dance at each moment her beauty became more revealed and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves every one was enchanted especially the prince who called her his little foundling and she danced again quite readily to please him though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives 
 the prince said she should remain with him always and she 
 received permission to sleep at his door on a velvet cushion he 
 had a dress made for her that she might accompany him on 
 horseback they rode together through the woods where the green boughs touched their shoulders and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves she climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains and although her tender feet bled so that even her 
 steps were marked she only laughed and followed him till they 
 could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds 
 travelling to distant lands while at the palace and when 
 all the household were asleep she would go and sit on the broad 
 marble steps for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the 
 cold and then she thought of all those below in the deep 
 once during the night her sisters came up singing 
 sorrowfully as they floated on the water she beckoned to them and 
 then they recognized her and told her how she had grieved them 
 after that they came to the same place every night and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years and the old sea king her father with his crown on his head they stretched out their hands towards her but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did 
 
 as the days passed she loved the prince more fondly and he loved 
 her as he would love a little child but it never came into his head 
 to make her his wife yet unless he married her she could not 
 receive an immortal soul and on the morning after his marriage 
 with another she would dissolve into the foam of the sea 
 
 do you not love me the best of them all the eyes of the 
 little mermaid seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her fair forehead 
 
 yes you are dear to me said the prince for you have the best 
 heart and you are the most devoted to me you are like a young maiden whom i once saw but whom i shall never meet again i was in a ship that was wrecked and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple where several young maidens performed the service the youngest of them found me on the shore and saved my life i saw her but twice and she is the only one in the world whom i could love but you are like her and you have almost driven her image out of my mind she belongs to the holy temple and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her and we will never part 
 
 ah he knows not that it was i who saved his life thought the 
 little mermaid i carried him over the sea to the wood where the 
 temple stands i sat beneath the foam and watched till the human 
 beings came to help him i saw the pretty maiden that he loves 
 better than he loves me and the mermaid sighed deeply but she could not shed tears he says the maiden belongs to the holy temple 
 therefore she will never return to the world they will meet no 
 more while i am by his side and see him every day i will take 
 care of him and love him and give up my life for his sake 
 
 very soon it was said that the prince must marry and that the 
 beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife for a fine 
 ship was being fitted out although the prince gave out that he merely 
 intended to pay a visit to the king it was generally supposed that he 
 really went to see his daughter a great company were to go with 
 him the little mermaid smiled and shook her head she knew the 
 thoughts better than any of the others 
 
 i must travel he had said to her i must see this beautiful 
 princess my parents desire it but they will not oblige me to bring 
 her home as my bride i cannot love her she is not like the beautiful 
 maiden in the temple whom you resemble if i were forced to choose 
 a bride i would rather choose you my dumb foundling with those 
 expressive eyes and then he kissed her rosy mouth played with her 
 long waving hair and laid his head on her heart while she dreamed of 
 human happiness and an immortal soul you are not afraid of the 
 sea my dumb child said he as they stood on the deck of the noble 
 ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king 
 and then he told her of storm and of calm of strange fishes in the 
 deep beneath them and of what the divers had seen there and she 
 smiled at his descriptions for she knew better than any one what 
 wonders were at the bottom of the sea 
 
 in the moonlight when all on board were asleep excepting the man 
 at the helm who was steering she sat on the deck gazing down 
 through the clear water she thought she could distinguish her 
 castle and upon it her aged grandmother with the silver 
 crown on her head looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the 
 vessel then her sisters came up on the waves and gazed at her 
 mournfully wringing their white hands she beckoned to them and 
 smiled and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was but 
 the approached and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw 
 
 the next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful 
 town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit the 
 church bells were ringing and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets and soldiers with flying colors and glittering bayonets lined the rocks through which they passed every day was a festival balls and entertainments followed one another 
 
 but the princess had not yet appeared people said that she was 
 being brought up and educated in a religious house where she was 
 learning every royal virtue at last she came then the little 
 mermaid who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty her skin was delicately fair and beneath her long dark her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity 
 
 it was you said the prince who saved my life when i lay 
 dead on the beach and he folded his blushing bride in his arms oh i am too happy said he to the little mermaid my fondest hopes are all fulfilled you will rejoice at my happiness for your devotion to me is great and sincere 
 
 the little mermaid kissed his hand and felt as if her heart 
 were already broken his wedding morning would bring death to her and she would change into the foam of the sea all the church bells 
 rung and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal 
 perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar the 
 priests waved the censers while the bride and bridegroom joined their 
 hands and received the blessing of the bishop the little mermaid 
 dressed in silk and gold held up the train but her ears 
 heard nothing of the festive music and her eyes saw not the holy 
 ceremony she thought of the night of death which was coming to her 
 and of all she had lost in the world on the same evening the bride 
 and bridegroom went on board ship cannons were roaring flags waving and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected it contained elegant couches for the reception of the bridal pair during the night the ship with swelling sails and a 
 favorable wind glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea 
 when it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit and the 
 sailors danced merrily on the deck the little mermaid could not 
 help thinking of her first rising out of the sea when she had seen 
 similar festivities and joys and she joined in the dance poised 
 herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey and all 
 present cheered her with wonder she had never danced so elegantly 
 before her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives but she 
 cared not for it a sharper pang had pierced through her heart she 
 knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince for 
 whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home she had given up her beautiful voice and suffered pain daily for him while 
 he knew nothing of it this was the last evening that she would 
 breathe the same air with him or gaze on the starry sky and the 
 deep sea an eternal night without a thought or a dream awaited her 
 she had no soul and now she could never win one all was joy and 
 gayety on board ship till long after midnight she laughed and 
 danced with the rest while the thoughts of death were in her heart 
 the prince kissed his beautiful bride while she played with his raven 
 hair till they went to rest in the splendid tent then all 
 became still on board the ship the helmsman alone awake stood at 
 the helm the little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of 
 the vessel and looked towards the east for the first blush of 
 morning for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death she 
 saw her sisters rising out of the flood they were as pale as herself 
 but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind and had 
 been cut off 
 
 we have given our hair to the witch said they to obtain 
 help for you that you may not die she has given us a knife 
 here it is see it is very sharp before the sun rises you must plunge 
 it into the heart of the prince when the warm blood falls upon your 
 feet they will grow together again and form into a tail and 
 you will be once more a mermaid and return to us to live out your 
 three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea 
 foam haste then he or you must die before sunrise our old 
 grandmother moans so for you that her white hair is falling off 
 from sorrow as ours fell under the scissors kill the 
 prince and come back hasten do you not see the first red streaks 
 in the sky in a few minutes the sun will rise and you must die and 
 then they sighed deeply and mournfully and sank down beneath the 
 waves 
 
 the little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent 
 and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the 
 breast she bent down and kissed his fair brow then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter then she glanced at the sharp knife and again fixed her eyes on the prince who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams she was in his thoughts and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid then she flung it far away from her into the waves the water turned red where it fell and the drops that spurted up looked like blood she cast one more lingering glance at the prince and then threw herself from the ship into the sea and thought her body was 
 dissolving into foam the sun rose above the waves and his warm 
 rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid who did not feel 
 as if she were dying she saw the bright sun and all around her 
 floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings she could see 
 through them the white sails of the ship and the red clouds in the 
 sky their speech was melodious but too ethereal to be heard by 
 mortal ears as they were also unseen by mortal eyes the little 
 mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs and that she 
 continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam where am i 
 asked she and her voice sounded ethereal as the voice of those who 
 were with her no earthly music could imitate it 
 
 among the daughters of the air answered one of them a mermaid 
 has not an immortal soul nor can she obtain one unless she wins the 
 love of a human being on the power of another hangs her eternal 
 destiny but the daughters of the air although they do not possess an 
 immortal soul can by their good deeds procure one for themselves 
 we fly to warm countries and cool the sultry air that destroys 
 mankind with the pestilence we carry the perfume of the flowers to 
 spread health and restoration after we have striven for three hundred 
 years to all the good in our power we receive an immortal soul and 
 take part in the happiness of mankind you poor little mermaid 
 have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing you have 
 suffered and endured and raised yourself to the by your 
 good deeds and now by striving for three hundred years in the same 
 way you may obtain an immortal soul 
 
 the little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun 
 and felt them for the first time filling with tears on the ship in 
 which she had left the prince there were life and noise she saw 
 him and his beautiful bride searching for her sorrowfully they 
 gazed at the pearly foam as if they knew she had thrown herself 
 into the waves unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride and 
 fanned the prince and then mounted with the other children of the air 
 to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether 
 
 after three hundred years thus shall we float into the kingdom 
 of heaven said she and we may even get there sooner whispered 
 one of her companions unseen we can enter the houses of men where there are children and for every day on which we find a good child who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love our time of probation is shortened the child does not know when we fly through the room that we smile with joy at his good conduct for we can count one year less of our three hundred years but when we see a naughty or a wicked child we shed tears of sorrow and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial

 in what mirror m madeleine contemplates his hair 
 the day had begun to dawn 
 fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish night filled with happy visions at daybreak she fell asleep sister simplice who had been watching with her availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona the worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments bending over her drugs and phials and scrutinizing things very closely on account of the dimness which the of dawn spreads over all objects 
 suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek 
 m madeleine stood before her he had just entered silently 
 is it you mr mayor she exclaimed 
 he replied in a low voice 
 how is that poor woman 
 not so bad just now but we have been very uneasy 
 she explained to him what had passed 
 that fantine had been very ill the day before and that she was better now because she thought that the mayor had gone to montfermeil to get her child the sister dared not question the mayor but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there 
 all that is good said he you were right not to undeceive her 
 yes responded the sister but now mr mayor she will see you and will not see her child 
 what shall we say to her 
 he reflected for a moment 
 god will inspire us said he 
 but we cannot tell a lie murmured the sister half aloud 
 it was broad daylight in the room 
 the light fell full on m face 
 the sister chanced to raise her eyes to it 
 good god sir she exclaimed what has happened to you your hair is perfectly white 
 white said he 
 sister simplice had no mirror 
 she rummaged in a drawer and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed m madeleine took the mirror looked at his hair and said 
 well 
 he uttered the word indifferently and as though his mind were on something else 
 the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this 
 he inquired 
 can i see her 
 is not monsieur le maire going to have her child brought back to her said the sister hardly venturing to put the question 
 of course but it will take two or three days at least 
 if she were not to see monsieur le maire until that time went on the sister timidly she would not know that monsieur le maire had returned and it would be easy to inspire her with patience and when the child arrived she would naturally think monsieur le maire had just come with the child 
 we should not have to enact a lie 
 m madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments then he said with his calm gravity 
 no sister i must see her 
 i may perhaps be in haste 
 the nun did not appear to notice this word perhaps which communicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the speech she replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully 
 in that case she is asleep but monsieur le maire may enter 
 he made some remarks about a door which shut badly and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman then he entered chamber approached the bed and drew aside the curtains 
 she was asleep her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death 
 but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance and which transfigured her in her sleep her pallor had become whiteness her cheeks were crimson her long golden lashes the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her palpitated though they remained closed and drooping 
 her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings all ready to open wide and bear her away which could be felt as they rustled though they could not be seen to see her thus one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of 
 she resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying 
 the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul 
 m madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed gazing in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months before on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in that asylum 
 they were both still there in the same attitude she sleeping he praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair was gray and his was white 
 the sister had not entered with him 
 he stood beside the bed with his finger on his lips as though there were some one in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence 
 she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile 
 and cosette

 the nun did not appear to notice this word perhaps which communicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the speech she replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully 
 in that case she is asleep but monsieur le maire may enter 
 he made some remarks about a door which shut badly and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman then he entered chamber approached the bed and drew aside the curtains 
 she was asleep her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death 
 but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance and which transfigured her in her sleep her pallor had become whiteness her cheeks were crimson her long golden lashes the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her palpitated though they remained closed and drooping 
 her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings all ready to open wide and bear her away which could be felt as they rustled though they could not be seen to see her thus one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of 
 she resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying 
 the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul 
 m madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed gazing in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months before on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in that asylum 
 they were both still there in the same attitude she sleeping he praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair was gray and his was white 
 the sister had not entered with him 
 he stood beside the bed with his finger on his lips as though there were some one in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence 
 she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile 
 and cosette

 on the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle piteous and childlike moan 
 toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still he did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head 
 where is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but saw today was his first thought and i did not know this suffering either he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all till now but where am i 
 he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices speaking french he opened his eyes above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher and between them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his head and did not see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden up and stopped near him 
 it was napoleon accompanied by two bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the field 
 fine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier who with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide 
 the ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted your majesty said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at augesd 
 have some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having gone on a few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had already been taken by the french as a trophy 
 a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonski 
 prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was napoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as sire but he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not only did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to death and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew it was napoleon his hero but at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a small insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it at that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him or what was said of him he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently he collected all his strength to stir and utter a sound he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan which aroused his own pity 
 ah he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station 
 having said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat in hand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory 
 prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station he did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with other wounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospital during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak 
 the first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a french convoy officer who said rapidly we must halt here the emperor will pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners 
 there are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army that he is probably tired of them said another officer 
 all the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperor guards said the first one indicating a russian officer in the white uniform of the horse guards 
 bolkonski recognized prince repnin whom he had met in petersburg society beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer of the horse guards 
 bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse 
 which is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners 
 they named the colonel prince repnin 
 you are the commander of the emperor regiment of horse guards asked napoleon 
 i commanded a squadron replied repnin 
 your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon 
 the praise of a great commander is a highest reward said repnin 
 i bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young man beside you 
 prince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelen 
 after looking at him napoleon smiled 
 very young to come to meddle with us 
 youth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failing voice 
 a splendid reply said napoleon young man you will go far 
 prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and addressing him again used the epithet young man that was connected in his memory with prince andrew 
 well and you young man said he how do you feel mon brave 
 though five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixed straight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and understood that he could not answer him 
 everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking into eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain 
 the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds au revoir prince repnin and he spurred his horse and galloped away 
 his face shone with and pleasure 
 the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round her neck but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to return the holy image 
 prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform 
 it would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to mary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life and what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm i should be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to whom should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensible which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in words the great all or nothing said he to himself or to that god who has been sewn into this amulet by mary there is nothing certain nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand and the greatness of something incomprehensible but 
 the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his father wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon and above all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies 
 the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented itself to him he was already enjoying that happiness when that little napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and torments had followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of doctor larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence 
 he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not recover 
 and prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the loveliest rose in the world 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there lived once a great queen in whose garden were found at 
 all seasons the most splendid flowers and from every land in the 
 world she specially loved roses and therefore she possessed the most beautiful varieties of this flower from the wild with its leaves to the splendid provence rose they grew near the shelter of the walls wound themselves round columns and 
 crept along passages and over the ceilings of the 
 halls they were of every fragrance and color 
 
 but care and sorrow dwelt within these halls the queen lay upon a 
 sick bed and the doctors declared that she must die there is 
 still one thing that could save her said one of the wisest among 
 them bring her the loveliest rose in the world one which exhibits 
 the purest and brightest love and if it is brought to her before 
 her eyes close she will not die 
 
 then from all parts came those who brought roses that bloomed in 
 every garden but they were not the right sort the flower must be one 
 from the garden of love but which of the roses there showed forth the highest and purest love the poets sang of this rose the loveliest in the world and each named one which he considered worthy of that 
 title and intelligence of what was required was sent far and wide 
 to every heart that beat with love to every class age and 
 condition 
 
 no one has yet named the flower said the wise man no one 
 has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor it is 
 not a rose from the coffin of romeo and juliet or from the grave of 
 walburg though these roses will live in everlasting song it is not 
 one of the roses which sprouted forth from the fame of 
 winkelreid the blood which flows from the breast of a hero who dies for his country is sacred and his memory is sweet and no rose can be redder than the blood which flows from his veins neither is it the magic flower of science to obtain which wondrous flower a man devotes many an hour of his fresh young life in sleepless nights in a 
 lonely chamber 
 
 i know where it blooms said a happy mother who came with her 
 lovely child to the bedside of the queen i know where the 
 loveliest rose in the world is it is seen on the blooming cheeks of 
 my sweet child when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy 
 when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes and smiles upon me with 
 childlike affection 
 
 this is a lovely rose said the wise man but there is one 
 still more lovely 
 
 yes one far more lovely said one of the women i have seen 
 it and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom but it was white 
 like the leaves of a i saw it on the cheeks of the 
 queen she had taken off her golden crown and through the long 
 dreary night she carried her sick child in her arms she wept over 
 it kissed it and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that 
 hour of her anguish 
 
 holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of grief but 
 it is not the one we seek 
 
 no the loveliest rose in the world i saw at the table 
 said the good old bishop i saw it shine as if an face had 
 appeared a young maiden knelt at the altar and renewed the vows made at her baptism and there were white roses and red roses on the 
 blushing cheeks of that young girl she looked up to heaven with all 
 the purity and love of her young spirit in all the expression of 
 the highest and purest love 
 
 may she be blessed said the wise man but no one has yet named 
 the loveliest rose in the world 
 
 then there came into the room a child the little son 
 tears stood in his eyes and glistened on his cheeks he carried a 
 great book and the binding was of velvet with silver clasps 
 mother cried the little boy only hear what i have read and 
 the child seated himself by the bedside and read from the book of him who suffered death on the cross to save all men even who are yet unborn he read greater love hath no man than this and as he 
 read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen and her eyes 
 became so enlightened and clear that she saw from the leaves of the 
 book a lovely rose spring forth a type of him who shed his blood on the cross 
 
 i see it she said he who beholds this the loveliest rose 
 on earth shall never die

 book 
 chapter ii 
 
 fantine happy 
 she made no movement of either surprise or of joy she was joy itself that simple question and cosette was put with so profound a faith with so much certainty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt that he found not a word of reply she continued 
 i knew that you were there 
 i was asleep but i saw you i have seen you for a long long time 
 i have been following you with my eyes all night long 
 you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms 
 he raised his glance to the crucifix 
 but she resumed tell me where cosette is 
 why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking 
 he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall 
 fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance he came to the aid of m madeleine 
 calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here 
 eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness 
 oh she exclaimed bring her to me 
 touching illusion of a mother 
 cosette was for her still the little child who is carried 
 not yet said the doctor not just now 
 you still have some fever the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm you must be cured first 
 she interrupted him impetuously 
 but i am cured 
 oh i tell you that i am cured 
 what an ass that doctor is 
 the idea 
 i want to see my child 
 you see said the doctor how excited you become 
 so long as you are in this state i shall oppose your having your child 
 it is not enough to see her it is necessary that you should live for her when you are reasonable i will bring her to you myself 
 the poor mother bowed her head 
 i beg your pardon doctor i really beg your pardon 
 formerly i should never have spoken as i have just done so many misfortunes have happened to me that i sometimes do not know what i am saying i understand you you fear the emotion 
 i will wait as long as you like but i swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter 
 i have been seeing her i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening 
 do you know if she were brought to me now i should talk to her very gently that is all 
 is it not quite natural that i should desire to see my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from montfermeil i am not angry 
 i know well that i am about to be happy 
 all night long i have seen white things and persons who smiled at me when monsieur le docteur pleases he shall bring me cosette i have no longer any fever i am well 
 i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me any more but i am going to behave as though i were ill and not stir to please these ladies here when it is seen that i am very calm they will say she must have her child 
 m madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed 
 she turned towards him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in order that seeing her so peaceable they might make no difficulty about bringing cosette to her 
 but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m madeleine 
 did you have a pleasant trip monsieur le maire 
 oh how good you were to go and get her for me 
 only tell me how she is did she stand the journey well 
 alas she will not recognize me she must have forgotten me by this time poor darling 
 children have no memories 
 they are like birds 
 a child sees one thing and another thing and thinks of nothing any longer and did she have white linen 
 did those thenardiers keep her clean how have they fed her 
 oh if you only knew how i have suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness 
 now it is all past 
 i am happy 
 oh how i should like to see her 
 do you think her pretty monsieur le maire 
 is not my daughter beautiful 
 you must have been very cold in that diligence could she not be brought for just one little instant 
 she might be taken away directly afterwards 
 tell me you are the master it could be so if you chose 
 he took her hand 
 cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much vivacity and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes and that makes you cough 
 in fact fits of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word 
 fantine did not murmur she feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring and she began to talk of indifferent things 
 montfermeil is quite pretty is it not 
 people go there on pleasure parties in summer 
 are the thenardiers prosperous there are not many travellers in their parts 
 that inn of theirs is a sort of a 
 m madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated 
 the doctor having finished his visit retired 
 sister simplice remained alone with them 
 but in the midst of this pause fantine exclaimed 
 i hear her mon dieu i hear her 
 she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath and began to listen with rapture 
 there was a child playing in the child of the portress or of some it was one of those accidents which are always occurring and which seem to form a part of the mysterious of mournful scenes 
 the little girl was going and coming running to warm herself laughing singing at the top of her voice 
 alas in what are the plays of children not intermingled 
 it was this little girl whom fantine heard singing 
 oh she resumed it is my cosette 
 i recognize her voice 
 the child retreated as it had come the voice died away fantine listened for a while longer then her face clouded over and m madeleine heard her say in a low voice 
 how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter 
 that man has an evil countenance that he has 
 but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again she continued to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how happy we are going to be 
 we shall have a little garden the very first thing m madeleine has promised it to me 
 my daughter will play in the garden 
 she must know her letters by this time i will make her spell 
 she will run over the grass after butterflies i will watch her 
 then she will take her first communion 
 ah when will she take her first communion 
 she began to reckon on her fingers 
 one two three is seven years old 
 in five years she will have a white veil and openwork stockings she will look like a little woman 
 o my good sister you do not know how foolish i become when i think of my first communion 
 she began to laugh 
 he had released hand 
 he listened to her words as one listens to the sighing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom 
 all at once she ceased speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanically fantine had become terrible 
 she no longer spoke she no longer breathed she had raised herself to a sitting posture her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise her face which had been radiant but a moment before was ghastly and she seemed to have fixed her eyes rendered large with terror on something alarming at the other extremity of the room 
 good god he exclaimed what ails you fantine

 fantine happy 
 she made no movement of either surprise or of joy she was joy itself that simple question and cosette was put with so profound a faith with so much certainty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt that he found not a word of reply she continued 
 i knew that you were there 
 i was asleep but i saw you i have seen you for a long long time 
 i have been following you with my eyes all night long 
 you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms 
 he raised his glance to the crucifix 
 but she resumed tell me where cosette is 
 why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking 
 he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall 
 fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance he came to the aid of m madeleine 
 calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here 
 eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness 
 oh she exclaimed bring her to me 
 touching illusion of a mother 
 cosette was for her still the little child who is carried 
 not yet said the doctor not just now 
 you still have some fever the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm you must be cured first 
 she interrupted him impetuously 
 but i am cured 
 oh i tell you that i am cured 
 what an ass that doctor is 
 the idea 
 i want to see my child 
 you see said the doctor how excited you become 
 so long as you are in this state i shall oppose your having your child 
 it is not enough to see her it is necessary that you should live for her when you are reasonable i will bring her to you myself 
 the poor mother bowed her head 
 i beg your pardon doctor i really beg your pardon 
 formerly i should never have spoken as i have just done so many misfortunes have happened to me that i sometimes do not know what i am saying i understand you you fear the emotion 
 i will wait as long as you like but i swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter 
 i have been seeing her i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening 
 do you know if she were brought to me now i should talk to her very gently that is all 
 is it not quite natural that i should desire to see my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from montfermeil i am not angry 
 i know well that i am about to be happy 
 all night long i have seen white things and persons who smiled at me when monsieur le docteur pleases he shall bring me cosette i have no longer any fever i am well 
 i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me any more but i am going to behave as though i were ill and not stir to please these ladies here when it is seen that i am very calm they will say she must have her child 
 m madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed 
 she turned towards him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in order that seeing her so peaceable they might make no difficulty about bringing cosette to her 
 but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m madeleine 
 did you have a pleasant trip monsieur le maire 
 oh how good you were to go and get her for me 
 only tell me how she is did she stand the journey well 
 alas she will not recognize me she must have forgotten me by this time poor darling 
 children have no memories 
 they are like birds 
 a child sees one thing and another thing and thinks of nothing any longer and did she have white linen 
 did those thenardiers keep her clean how have they fed her 
 oh if you only knew how i have suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness 
 now it is all past 
 i am happy 
 oh how i should like to see her 
 do you think her pretty monsieur le maire 
 is not my daughter beautiful 
 you must have been very cold in that diligence could she not be brought for just one little instant 
 she might be taken away directly afterwards 
 tell me you are the master it could be so if you chose 
 he took her hand 
 cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much vivacity and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes and that makes you cough 
 in fact fits of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word 
 fantine did not murmur she feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring and she began to talk of indifferent things 
 montfermeil is quite pretty is it not 
 people go there on pleasure parties in summer 
 are the thenardiers prosperous there are not many travellers in their parts 
 that inn of theirs is a sort of a 
 m madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated 
 the doctor having finished his visit retired 
 sister simplice remained alone with them 
 but in the midst of this pause fantine exclaimed 
 i hear her mon dieu i hear her 
 she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath and began to listen with rapture 
 there was a child playing in the child of the portress or of some it was one of those accidents which are always occurring and which seem to form a part of the mysterious of mournful scenes 
 the little girl was going and coming running to warm herself laughing singing at the top of her voice 
 alas in what are the plays of children not intermingled 
 it was this little girl whom fantine heard singing 
 oh she resumed it is my cosette 
 i recognize her voice 
 the child retreated as it had come the voice died away fantine listened for a while longer then her face clouded over and m madeleine heard her say in a low voice 
 how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter 
 that man has an evil countenance that he has 
 but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again she continued to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how happy we are going to be 
 we shall have a little garden the very first thing m madeleine has promised it to me 
 my daughter will play in the garden 
 she must know her letters by this time i will make her spell 
 she will run over the grass after butterflies i will watch her 
 then she will take her first communion 
 ah when will she take her first communion 
 she began to reckon on her fingers 
 one two three is seven years old 
 in five years she will have a white veil and openwork stockings she will look like a little woman 
 o my good sister you do not know how foolish i become when i think of my first communion 
 she began to laugh 
 he had released hand 
 he listened to her words as one listens to the sighing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom 
 all at once she ceased speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanically fantine had become terrible 
 she no longer spoke she no longer breathed she had raised herself to a sitting posture her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise her face which had been radiant but a moment before was ghastly and she seemed to have fixed her eyes rendered large with terror on something alarming at the other extremity of the room 
 good god he exclaimed what ails you fantine 
 she made no reply she did not remove her eyes from the object which she seemed to see 
 she removed one hand from his arm and with the other made him a sign to look behind him 
 he turned and beheld javert

 book four 
 chapter i 
 
 early in the year nicholas rostov returned home on leave denisov was going home to voronezh and rostov persuaded him to travel with him as far as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before moscow denisov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and despite the jolting ruts across the road did not once wake up on the way to moscow but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside rostov who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to moscow 
 how much longer how much longer oh these insufferable streets shops bakers signboards street lamps and sleighs thought rostov when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered moscow 
 denisov here asleep he added leaning forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the sleigh 
 denisov gave no answer 
 the corner at the crossroads where the cabman zakhar has his stand and zakhar himself and still the same horse and the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread you hurry up now then 
 which house is it asked the driver 
 why that one right at the end the big one you see our house said rostov of course our house denisov denisov almost there 
 denisov raised his head coughed and made no answer 
 dmitri said rostov to his valet on the box those lights are in our house they 
 yes sir and a light in your study 
 then not gone to bed yet what do you think mind now forget to put out my new coat added rostov fingering his new mustache now then get on he shouted to the driver do wake up vaska he went on turning to denisov whose head was again nodding come get on you shall have three rubles for vodka get on rostov shouted when the sleigh was only three houses from his door it seemed to him the horses were not moving at all at last the sleigh bore to the right drew up at an entrance and rostov saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off the porch and the post by the side of the pavement he sprang out before the sleigh stopped and ran into the hall the house stood cold and silent as if quite regardless of who had come to it there was no one in the hall oh god is everyone all right he thought stopping for a moment with a sinking heart and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase the old door handle which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned turned as loosely as ever a solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom 
 old michael was asleep on the chest prokofy the footman who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges he looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement 
 gracious heavens the young count he cried recognizing his young master can it be my treasure and prokofy trembling with excitement rushed toward the door probably in order to announce him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss the young shoulder 
 all well asked rostov drawing away his arm 
 yes god be thanked yes just finished supper let me have a look at you your excellency 
 is everything quite all right 
 the lord be thanked yes 
 rostov who had completely forgotten denisov not wishing anyone to forestall him threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom all was the same there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it but someone had already seen the young master and before he had reached the drawing room something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging more kissing more outcries and tears of joy he could not distinguish which was papa which natasha and which petya everyone shouted talked and kissed him at the same time only his mother was not there he noticed that 
 and i did not know nicholas my darling 
 here he is our own kolya dear fellow how he has changed where are the candles tea 
 nicholas 
 and me kiss me 
 dearest and me 
 sonya natasha petya anna mikhaylovna vera and the old count were all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the room exclaiming and and 
 petya clinging to his legs kept shouting and me too 
 natasha after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face with kisses holding him tight by the skirt of his coat sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly 
 all around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all around were lips seeking a kiss 
 sonya too all rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss looked eagerly toward his eyes waiting for the look for which she longed sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty especially at this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not taking her eyes off him and smiling and holding her breath he gave her a grateful look but was still expectant and looking for someone the old countess had not yet come but now steps were heard at the door steps so rapid that they could hardly be his 
 yet it was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made since he had left all the others let him go and he ran to her when they met she fell on his breast sobbing she could not lift her face but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his jacket denisov who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there and wiped his eyes at the sight 
 vasili denisov your friend he said introducing himself to the count who was looking inquiringly at him 
 you are most welcome i know i know said the count kissing and embracing denisov nicholas wrote us natasha vera look here is denisov 
 the same happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of denisov 
 darling denisov screamed natasha beside herself with rapture springing to him putting her arms round him and kissing him this escapade made everybody feel confused denisov blushed too but smiled and taking hand kissed it 
 denisov was shown to the room prepared for him and the rostovs all gathered round nicholas in the sitting room 
 the old countess not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched every movement word or look of his never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him his brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea handkerchief and pipe 
 rostov was very happy in the love they showed him but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed insufficient and he kept expecting something more more and yet more 
 next morning after the fatigues of their journey the travelers slept till ten 
 in the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers satchels sabretaches open portmanteaus and dirty boots two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall the servants were bringing in jugs and basins hot water for shaving and their clothes there was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco 
 hallo gwiska my pipe came vasili husky voice wostov get up 
 rostov rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together raised his disheveled head from the hot pillow 
 why is it late 
 late nearly ten answered voice a rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls voices came from the adjoining room the door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black hair and merry faces it was natasha sonya and petya who had come to see whether they were getting up 
 nicholas get up voice was again heard at the door 
 directly 
 meanwhile petya having found and seized the sabers in the outer room with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed opened the bedroom door 
 is this your saber he shouted 
 the girls sprang aside denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket looking with a scared face at his comrade for help the door having let petya in closed again a sound of laughter came from behind it 
 nicholas come out in your dressing gown said voice 
 is this your saber asked petya or is it yours he said addressing the denisov with servile deference 
 rostov hurriedly put something on his feet drew on his dressing gown and went out natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her foot into the other sonya when he came in was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down they were dressed alike in new frocks and were both fresh rosy and bright sonya ran away but natasha taking her arm led him into the sitting room where they began talking they hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves natasha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself not because what they were saying was amusing but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter 
 oh how nice how splendid she said to everything 
 rostov felt that under the influence of the warm rays of love that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his soul and his face 
 no but listen she said now you are quite a man you awfully glad my brother she touched his mustache i want to know what you men are like are you the same as we no 
 why did sonya run away asked rostov 
 ah yes a whole long story how are you going to speak to her thou or you 
 as may happen said rostov 
 no call her you please tell you all about it some other time no tell you now you know my dearest friend such a friend that i burned my arm for her sake look here 
 she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long slender delicate arm high above the elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress 
 i burned this to prove my love for her i just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there 
 sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms in what used to be his old schoolroom and looking into wildly bright eyes rostov that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else but gave him some of the best joys of his life and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless he understood and was not surprised at it 
 well and is that all he asked 
 we are such friends such friends all that ruler business was just nonsense but we are friends forever she if she loves anyone does it for life but i understand that i forget quickly 
 well what then 
 well she loves me and you like that 
 natasha suddenly flushed 
 why you remember before you went away well she says you are to forget all that she says i shall love him always but let him be free that lovely and noble yes very noble it asked natasha so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was now saying she had talked of before with tears 
 rostov became thoughtful 
 i never go back on my word he said besides sonya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness 
 no no cried natasha she and i have already talked it over we knew say so but it do because you see if you say that if you consider yourself bound by your promise it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously it makes it as if you were marrying her because you must and that do at all 
 rostov saw that it had been well considered by them sonya had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day today when he had caught a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely she was a charming girl of sixteen evidently passionately in love with him he did not doubt that for an instant why should he not love her now and even marry her rostov thought but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him yes they have taken a wise decision he thought i must remain free 
 well then excellent said he talk it over later on oh how glad i am to have you 
 well and are you still true to boris he continued 
 oh what nonsense cried natasha laughing i think about him or anyone else and i want anything of the kind 
 dear me then what are you up now 
 now repeated natasha and a happy smile lit up her face have you seen duport 
 no 
 not seen duport the famous dancer well then you understand what up to 
 curving her arms natasha held out her skirts as dancers do ran back a few steps turned cut a caper brought her little feet sharply together and made some steps on the very tips of her toes 
 see standing see she said but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer so what up to never marry anyone but will be a dancer only tell anyone 
 rostov laughed so loud and merrily that denisov in his bedroom felt envious and natasha could not help joining in 
 no but you think nice she kept repeating 
 nice and so you no longer wish to marry boris 
 natasha flared up i want to marry anyone and tell him so when i see him 
 dear me said rostov 
 but all rubbish natasha chattered on and is denisov nice she asked 
 yes indeed 
 oh well then go and dress is he very terrible denisov 
 why terrible asked nicholas no vaska is a splendid fellow 
 you call him vaska funny and is he very nice 
 very 
 well then be quick all have breakfast together 
 and natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a ballet dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile when rostov met sonya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know how to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment of meeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not be done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you sonya but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared by intermediacy to remind him of his promise and then thanked him for his love his looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her for that would be impossible 
 how strange it is said vera selecting a moment when all were silent that sonya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers 
 remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most of her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sonya nicholas and natasha but even the old countess who dreading this love affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant match blushed like a girl 
 denisov to surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see him

 rostov laughed so loud and merrily that denisov in his bedroom felt envious and natasha could not help joining in 
 no but you think nice she kept repeating 
 nice and so you no longer wish to marry boris 
 natasha flared up i want to marry anyone and tell him so when i see him 
 dear me said rostov 
 but all rubbish natasha chattered on and is denisov nice she asked 
 yes indeed 
 oh well then go and dress is he very terrible denisov 
 why terrible asked nicholas no vaska is a splendid fellow 
 you call him vaska funny and is he very nice 
 very 
 well then be quick all have breakfast together 
 and natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a ballet dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile when rostov met sonya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know how to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment of meeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not be done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you sonya but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared by intermediacy to remind him of his promise and then thanked him for his love his looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her for that would be impossible 
 how strange it is said vera selecting a moment when all were silent that sonya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers 
 remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most of her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sonya nicholas and natasha but even the old countess who dreading this love affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant match blushed like a girl 
 denisov to surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see him

 the levins had been two months in moscow the date had long passed on which according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned in such matters kitty should have been confined but she was still about and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than two months ago the doctor the midwife and dolly and her mother and most of all levin who could not think of the approaching event without terror began to be impatient and uneasy kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm and happy 
 she was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child for her to some extent actually existing already and she brooded blissfully over this feeling he was not by now altogether a part of herself but sometimes lived his own life independently of her often this separate being gave her pain but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy 
 all the people she loved were with her and all were so good to her so attentively looking out for her so entirely pleasant was everything presented to her that if she had not known and felt that it must all soon be over she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter life the only thing that spoiled the charm of this mode of life was that here her husband was not as she loved him to be and as he was in the country 
 she liked his serene friendly and hospitable manner in the country in the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him and still more to her at home in the country definitely knowing himself to be in his right place he was never in haste to be off elsewhere was occupied all the time here in town he was in a continual hurry as though afraid of missing something and yet he had nothing to do and she felt pity for him to others she knew he did not appear an object of pity on the contrary when kitty looked at him in society as one sometimes looks at those one loves trying to see him as if he were a stranger so as to catch the impression he must make on others she saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure that he was very attractive with his honesty his rather reserved courtesy to women his powerful figure and striking as she thought and expressive face but she saw him not from without but from within she saw that here he was not himself that was the only way she could define his condition to herself sometimes she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it 
 what had he to do indeed he did not care for cards he did not go to a club spending the time with jovial gentlemen of type she knew now what that meant it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking she could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions was he to go into society but she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women and that she could not wish for should he stay at home with her her mother and her sisters but much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects as the old prince called the sisters talks she knew it must bore him what was there left for him to do to go on writing his book he had indeed attempted to do it and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his book but as he told her the more he did nothing the less time he had to do anything and besides he complained that he had talked too much about his book here and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him 
 one advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town whether it was that their conditions in town were different or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect they had no quarrels in moscow from jealousy which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country 
 one event an event of great importance to both from that point of view did indeed happen which was meeting with vronsky 
 the old princess marya borissovna godmother who had always been very fond of her had insisted on seeing her kitty though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition went with her father to see the venerable old lady and there met vronsky 
 the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features once so familiar to her her breath failed her the blood rushed to her heart and a vivid blush she felt it overspread her face but this lasted only a few seconds before her father who purposely began talking in a loud voice to vronsky had finished she was perfectly ready to look at vronsky to speak to him if necessary exactly as she spoke to princess marya borissovna and more than that to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant 
 she said a few words to him even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections which he called our parliament she had to smile to show she saw the joke but she turned away immediately to princess marya borissovna and did not once glance at him till he got up to go then she looked at him but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying 
 she was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting vronsky but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her she was pleased with herself she had not expected she would have had the power while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for vronsky not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him 
 levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met vronsky at princess marya it was very hard for her to tell him this but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting as he did not question her but simply gazed at her with a frown 
 i am very sorry you there she said it so much the fact that you in the room i have been so natural in your presence i am blushing now much more much much more she said blushing till the tears came into her eyes but a pity you have looked through a peephole 
 the truthful eyes told levin that she was satisfied with herself and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her which was all she wanted when he had heard everything even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing but that afterward she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election but would try the first time he met vronsky to be as friendly as possible 
 so wretched to feel that any man who is almost your enemy and whom painful to meet said levin very very glad

 she liked his serene friendly and hospitable manner in the country in the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him and still more to her at home in the country definitely knowing himself to be in his right place he was never in haste to be off elsewhere was occupied all the time here in town he was in a continual hurry as though afraid of missing something and yet he had nothing to do and she felt pity for him to others she knew he did not appear an object of pity on the contrary when kitty looked at him in society as one sometimes looks at those one loves trying to see him as if he were a stranger so as to catch the impression he must make on others she saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure that he was very attractive with his honesty his rather reserved courtesy to women his powerful figure and striking as she thought and expressive face but she saw him not from without but from within she saw that here he was not himself that was the only way she could define his condition to herself sometimes she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it 
 what had he to do indeed he did not care for cards he did not go to a club spending the time with jovial gentlemen of type she knew now what that meant it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking she could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions was he to go into society but she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women and that she could not wish for should he stay at home with her her mother and her sisters but much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects as the old prince called the sisters talks she knew it must bore him what was there left for him to do to go on writing his book he had indeed attempted to do it and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his book but as he told her the more he did nothing the less time he had to do anything and besides he complained that he had talked too much about his book here and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him 
 one advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town whether it was that their conditions in town were different or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect they had no quarrels in moscow from jealousy which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country 
 one event an event of great importance to both from that point of view did indeed happen which was meeting with vronsky 
 the old princess marya borissovna godmother who had always been very fond of her had insisted on seeing her kitty though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition went with her father to see the venerable old lady and there met vronsky 
 the only thing kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features once so familiar to her her breath failed her the blood rushed to her heart and a vivid blush she felt it overspread her face but this lasted only a few seconds before her father who purposely began talking in a loud voice to vronsky had finished she was perfectly ready to look at vronsky to speak to him if necessary exactly as she spoke to princess marya borissovna and more than that to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant 
 she said a few words to him even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections which he called our parliament she had to smile to show she saw the joke but she turned away immediately to princess marya borissovna and did not once glance at him till he got up to go then she looked at him but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying 
 she was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting vronsky but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her she was pleased with herself she had not expected she would have had the power while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for vronsky not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him 
 levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met vronsky at princess marya it was very hard for her to tell him this but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting as he did not question her but simply gazed at her with a frown 
 i am very sorry you there she said it so much the fact that you in the room i have been so natural in your presence i am blushing now much more much much more she said blushing till the tears came into her eyes but a pity you have looked through a peephole 
 the truthful eyes told levin that she was satisfied with herself and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her which was all she wanted when he had heard everything even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing but that afterward she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election but would try the first time he met vronsky to be as friendly as possible 
 so wretched to feel that any man who is almost your enemy and whom painful to meet said levin very very glad
