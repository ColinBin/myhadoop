 and her son like her husband aroused in anna a feeling akin to disappointment in her imagination he had been better than he was in reality she had to descend to reality to enjoy him as he was but even so he was charming with his fair curls his blue eyes and his chubby graceful little legs in tightly stockings anna experienced an almost physical delight in the sensation of his nearness and his caresses and a moral reassurance when she met his ingenuous trusting and loving glance and heard his naive questions anna took out the presents children had sent him and told her son about tania a little girl in moscow and how tania could read and even taught the other children

 pravdin was a abroad and countess lidia ivanovna told the gist of his letter 
 next the countess spoke of other unpleasantnesses and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches and departed in haste since that day she had to attend the meeting of another society and also a slavonic committee 
 all this is as it has always been but how is it i notice it before anna asked herself or has she been very much irritated today really ludicrous her object is to do good a christian yet forever angry and forever having enemies and always enemies in the name of christianity and doing good 
 after countess lidia ivanovna another friend came the wife of a director of the department who told her all the news of the town at three she too went away promising to come to dinner alexei alexandrovich was at the ministry anna left alone spent the time till dinner in lending her presence to her dinner he dined apart from his parents in putting her things in order and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her escritoire 
 the feeling of unreasoning shame which she had felt during the journey and her agitation had completely vanished in the accustomed conditions of her life she again felt herself firm and irreproachable 
 she recalled with wonder her state of mind only yesterday what was it nothing vronsky said something silly which it was easy to put an end to and i answered just as i should have to speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and impermissible to speak of it would be to attach importance to that which has none she remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost declaration made her in peterburg by a young man a subordinate of her and how alexei alexandrovich had answered that every woman of the world was exposed to this sort of thing but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact and would never permit himself to degrade her and himself by jealousy so then no reason to say anything and thank god there anything to say she told herself

 alexei alexandrovich came back from the ministry at four but as often happened had no chance to drop in at her room he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions and to sign certain papers brought him by his head clerk at dinnertime there were always at least three people dining with the karenins there arrived an old lady a cousin of alexei alexandrovich the director of the department and his wife and a young man who had been recommended to alexei alexandrovich for a post anna went into the drawing room to entertain these guests precisely at five before the bronze peter the first clock had finished the fifth stroke alexei alexandrovich made his entry in white tie and evening coat with two stars as he had to go out directly after dinner every minute of alexei life was taken up and apportioned and in order to accomplish all that each day held for him he adhered to the strictest orderliness nor haste nor rest was his device he entered the dining hall bowed to all and hurriedly sat down smiling to his wife 
 yes my solitude is over you believe how uncomfortable he laid stress on the word uncomfortable it is to dine alone 
 at dinner he chatted with his wife about things at moscow and asked with his mocking smile about stepan arkadyevich but the conversation was for the most part general dealing with the official and public news of peterburg after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests and again with a smile pressed his hand withdrew and drove off to the council anna went that evening neither to the princess betsy tverskaia who hearing of her return had invited her nor to the theater where she had a box for that evening her principal reason for not going out was because the dress she had expected to wear was not ready all in all anna was exceedingly annoyed when she started to dress for the evening after the departure of her guests before her departure for moscow she who was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well yet inexpensively had given her dressmaker three dresses to make over the dresses were to be made over so that their old selves would be unrecognizable and they should have been ready three days ago it turned out that two dresses were nowhere near ready while the other one had not been made over to liking the dressmaker came to explain asserting that her way was best and anna had become so heated that she blushed at the recollection to regain her composure fully she went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son putting him to bed herself making the sign of the cross over him and tucking him in she was glad she had not gone out anywhere and had spent the evening so well she felt so lighthearted and calm she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so significant on her railway journey was merely one of the ordinary trivial incidents of fashionable life and that she had no cause to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself anna sat down near the fireplace with an english novel and waited for her husband exactly at nine she heard his ring and he entered the room 
 here you are at last she observed extending her hand to him 
 he kissed her hand and sat down beside her 
 all in all i can see your trip was a success he said to her 
 yes very much so said she and she began telling him everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaia her arrival the accident at the station then she described the pity she had felt first for her brother and afterward for dolly 
 i do not suppose there is any excuse for such a man even though he is your brother said alexei alexandrovich sternly 
 anna smiled she knew that he said this precisely to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion she knew this trait in her husband and liked it 
 i am glad everything has ended so well and that you have returned he went on well and what do they say there about the new bill i have got passed in the council 
 anna had heard nothing of this bill and she felt that she could so readily forget what was to him of such importance 
 here on the other hand this has created a great deal of talk said he with a smile 
 she saw that alexei alexandrovich wanted to tell her something that pleased him about it and she brought him by questions to telling it with the same smile he told her of the ovations he had received as a consequence of the bill he had passed 
 i was very very happy it shows that at last an intelligent and firm view of the matter is forming among us 
 after his second cup of tea with cream and bread alexei alexandrovich got up and went toward his study 
 and you went nowhere this evening you really bored he said 
 oh no she answered getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study what are you reading now she asked 
 just now reading duc de lille posie des enfers he answered a most remarkable book 
 anna smiled as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love and putting her hand in his she kept him company to the door of his study she knew his habit now become a necessity of reading in the evening she knew too that in spite of his official duties which engrossed almost all his time he deemed it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual sphere she knew too that his actual interest lay in books dealing with politics philosophy and theology that art was utterly foreign to his nature but in spite of this or rather in consequence of it alexei alexandrovich never missed anything which created a sensation in the world of art but made it his duty to read everything she knew that in politics in philosophy in theology alexei alexandrovich was a doubter and a seeker yet in matters of art and poetry and above all of music of which he was totally devoid of understanding he had the most definite and decided opinions he was fond of discoursing on shakespeare raphael beethoven on the significance of new schools of poetry and music all of which were classified by him with most obvious consistency 
 well god be with you she said at the door of the study where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already placed near his armchair as for me going to write to moscow 
 he squeezed her hand and again kissed it 
 still a good man truthful kindhearted and remarkable in his own sphere anna said to herself back in her room as though defending him before someone who accused him saying that one could not love him but why is it his ears stick out so queerly or has he had his hair cut 
 exactly at twelve as anna was still sitting at her desk finishing a letter to dolly she heard the sound of measured slippered steps and alexei alexandrovich washed and combed a book under his arm approached her 
 come come said he with a particular smile and passed on into their bedroom 
 and what right had he to look at him like that reflected anna recalling how vronsky had looked at alexei alexandrovich 
 having disrobed she went into the bedroom but her face had none of the animation which during her stay at moscow had fairly spurted from her eyes and her smile on the contrary now the fire seemed extinct in her or hidden somewhere far away

 at dinner he chatted with his wife about things at moscow and asked with his mocking smile about stepan arkadyevich but the conversation was for the most part general dealing with the official and public news of peterburg after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests and again with a smile pressed his hand withdrew and drove off to the council anna went that evening neither to the princess betsy tverskaia who hearing of her return had invited her nor to the theater where she had a box for that evening her principal reason for not going out was because the dress she had expected to wear was not ready all in all anna was exceedingly annoyed when she started to dress for the evening after the departure of her guests before her departure for moscow she who was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well yet inexpensively had given her dressmaker three dresses to make over the dresses were to be made over so that their old selves would be unrecognizable and they should have been ready three days ago it turned out that two dresses were nowhere near ready while the other one had not been made over to liking the dressmaker came to explain asserting that her way was best and anna had become so heated that she blushed at the recollection to regain her composure fully she went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son putting him to bed herself making the sign of the cross over him and tucking him in she was glad she had not gone out anywhere and had spent the evening so well she felt so lighthearted and calm she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so significant on her railway journey was merely one of the ordinary trivial incidents of fashionable life and that she had no cause to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself anna sat down near the fireplace with an english novel and waited for her husband exactly at nine she heard his ring and he entered the room 
 here you are at last she observed extending her hand to him 
 he kissed her hand and sat down beside her 
 all in all i can see your trip was a success he said to her 
 yes very much so said she and she began telling him everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaia her arrival the accident at the station then she described the pity she had felt first for her brother and afterward for dolly 
 i do not suppose there is any excuse for such a man even though he is your brother said alexei alexandrovich sternly 
 anna smiled she knew that he said this precisely to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion she knew this trait in her husband and liked it 
 i am glad everything has ended so well and that you have returned he went on well and what do they say there about the new bill i have got passed in the council 
 anna had heard nothing of this bill and she felt that she could so readily forget what was to him of such importance 
 here on the other hand this has created a great deal of talk said he with a smile 
 she saw that alexei alexandrovich wanted to tell her something that pleased him about it and she brought him by questions to telling it with the same smile he told her of the ovations he had received as a consequence of the bill he had passed 
 i was very very happy it shows that at last an intelligent and firm view of the matter is forming among us 
 after his second cup of tea with cream and bread alexei alexandrovich got up and went toward his study 
 and you went nowhere this evening you really bored he said 
 oh no she answered getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study what are you reading now she asked 
 just now reading duc de lille posie des enfers he answered a most remarkable book 
 anna smiled as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love and putting her hand in his she kept him company to the door of his study she knew his habit now become a necessity of reading in the evening she knew too that in spite of his official duties which engrossed almost all his time he deemed it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual sphere she knew too that his actual interest lay in books dealing with politics philosophy and theology that art was utterly foreign to his nature but in spite of this or rather in consequence of it alexei alexandrovich never missed anything which created a sensation in the world of art but made it his duty to read everything she knew that in politics in philosophy in theology alexei alexandrovich was a doubter and a seeker yet in matters of art and poetry and above all of music of which he was totally devoid of understanding he had the most definite and decided opinions he was fond of discoursing on shakespeare raphael beethoven on the significance of new schools of poetry and music all of which were classified by him with most obvious consistency 
 well god be with you she said at the door of the study where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already placed near his armchair as for me going to write to moscow 
 he squeezed her hand and again kissed it 
 still a good man truthful kindhearted and remarkable in his own sphere anna said to herself back in her room as though defending him before someone who accused him saying that one could not love him but why is it his ears stick out so queerly or has he had his hair cut 
 exactly at twelve as anna was still sitting at her desk finishing a letter to dolly she heard the sound of measured slippered steps and alexei alexandrovich washed and combed a book under his arm approached her 
 come come said he with a particular smile and passed on into their bedroom 
 and what right had he to look at him like that reflected anna recalling how vronsky had looked at alexei alexandrovich 
 having disrobed she went into the bedroom but her face had none of the animation which during her stay at moscow had fairly spurted from her eyes and her smile on the contrary now the fire seemed extinct in her or hidden somewhere far away

 upon his departure from peterburg vronsky had left his large apartments on morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade petritsky 
 petritsky was a young lieutenant not particularly and not merely not wealthy but in debt all around toward evening he was always drunk and he had often found himself in the guardhouse because of sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scrapes but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers at twelve as vronsky was driving up from the station to his quarters he saw near the entrance of the house a hired carriage familiar to him even as he rang he heard beyond the door masculine laughter the twitter of a feminine voice and shout if one of the villains let him in vronsky told the servant not to announce him and slipped noiselessly into the first room baroness shilton a friend of with a rosy little face and resplendent in a lilac satin gown and filling the whole room like a canary with her parisian accents sat at a round table brewing coffee petritsky in his overcoat and the cavalry captain kamerovsky in full uniform probably just come from duty were sitting near her 
 bravo vronsky shouted petritsky jumping up scraping his chair our host himself baroness some coffee for him out of the new coffeepot there we expect you i hope satisfied with the adornment of your study he said indicating the baroness you know each other of course 
 i should say so said vronsky with a bright smile squeezing the little hand why old friends 
 just returned after traveling said the baroness so run along oh be off this minute if in the way 
 home wherever you are baroness said vronsky how do you do kamerovsky he added coldly shaking hands with kamerovsky 
 there you can never say such charming things said the baroness turning to petritsky 
 no why not after dinner even i can say things quite as good 
 after dinner no merit in them well then give you some coffee go wash and tidy up said the baroness sitting down again and anxiously turning a gadget in the new coffee urn pierre give me the coffee she said addressing petritsky whom she called pierre playing on his surname making no secret of her relations with him i want to put some more in 
 spoil it 
 no i spoil it well and how is your wife said the baroness suddenly interrupting conversation with his comrade been marrying you off here have you brought your wife along 
 no baroness i was born a gypsy and a gypsy die 
 so much the better so much the better shake hands on it 
 and the baroness detaining vronsky began telling him interspersing her story with many jokes about her latest plans of life and seeking his counsel 
 he persists in refusing to give me a divorce well what am i to do he was her husband now i want to begin a suit against him what would you advise kamerovsky look after the coffee boiled out you can see taken up with business i want a lawsuit because i must have my property you can understand the stupidity of his saying that i am unfaithful to him she said contemptuously yet through it he wants to get the benefit of my fortune 
 vronsky heard with pleasure this lighthearted prattle of a pretty woman said yes to everything gave her counsel and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women in his peterburg world all people were divided into two utterly opposed kinds one the lower consisted of vulgar stupid and above all ridiculous people who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully wedded that a girl should be innocent a woman modest and a man manly and strong that one ought to bring up children earn bread and pay debts and various similar absurdities those people were of an and ridiculous kind but there was another kind of people real people to which they all belonged and here the chief thing was to be elegant magnanimous daring gay and to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion and to laugh at everything else 
 for the first moment only vronsky was startled after the impressions of a quite different world that he had brought with him from moscow but immediately as though he had thrust his feet into old slippers he stepped into his former lighthearted pleasant world 
 the coffee was really never made but spluttered over everyone and boiled away doing just what was required of it that is providing cause for much noise and laughter and spoiling a costly rug and the gown 
 well now or else never get washed and i shall have on my conscience the worst offense any decent person can commit uncleanliness so you would advise a knife at his throat 
 absolutely and in such a way that your little hand may not be far from his lips kiss it and all will end well answered vronsky 
 so the tonight and with a rustle of her skirts she vanished 
 kamerovsky got up too and vronsky without waiting for him to go shook hands and went off to his dressing room while he was washing petritsky briefly outlined to him his position as far as it had changed since departure from peterburg no money whatsoever his father said he give him any nor pay his debts his tailor was trying to get him locked up and another fellow too was threatening to do so without fail the colonel of his regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease a resignation would be inevitable as for the baroness he was fed up with her particularly because she was forever wanting to give him money but there was another girl he intended showing her to vronsky a marvel exquisite in the strict oriental style genre of the slave rebecca you see he had had a row too with berkoshev and the latter intended sending seconds but of course it would all come to nothing altogether everything was going splendidly and was most jolly and without letting his comrade enter into further details of his position petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news as he listened to familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in vronsky felt the delightful sensation of coming back to the insouciant and customary life of peterburg 
 impossible he cried releasing the pedal of the wash basin in which he had been sousing his stalwart red neck impossible he cried at the news that laura had dropped fertinghof and had tied up with mileev and is he as stupid and satisfied as ever well and buzulukov doing 
 oh buzulukov got into a scrape simply lovely cried petritsky you know his passion for balls and he never misses a single one at court he went to a big ball in a new casque have you seen the new casques very good and lighter well standing no do listen 
 i am listening answered vronsky rubbing himself with a rough towel 
 the grand duchess passes by with some ambassador or other and as ill luck would have it their talk veers to the new casques and so the grand duchess wanted to show the new casque to the ambassador just then they catch sight of our dear boy standing there petritsky mimicked him standing with his casque the grand duchess requested him to give her the casque he do so up well they all wink at him and nod and frown give it to her do he still just stands there you can picture it to yourself well this his name tries to take the casque from him he give it up this chap tore it from him and hands it to the grand duchess this is the new casque says the grand duchess she turned the casque over and just picture it bang went a pear and candy out of it two pounds of candy collected all that our dear boy 
 vronsky rolled with laughter and long afterward even when he was talking of other things he would go off into peals of his hearty laughter baring his strong closely set teeth whenever he thought of the casque 
 having learned all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet got into his uniform and went off to report himself he intended afterward to go to his brother and to betsy and to pay several visits as an entering wedge into that society where he might meet madame karenina as always in peterburg he left home without any intention of returning before very late at night

 the grand duchess passes by with some ambassador or other and as ill luck would have it their talk veers to the new casques and so the grand duchess wanted to show the new casque to the ambassador just then they catch sight of our dear boy standing there petritsky mimicked him standing with his casque the grand duchess requested him to give her the casque he do so up well they all wink at him and nod and frown give it to her do he still just stands there you can picture it to yourself well this his name tries to take the casque from him he give it up this chap tore it from him and hands it to the grand duchess this is the new casque says the grand duchess she turned the casque over and just picture it bang went a pear and candy out of it two pounds of candy collected all that our dear boy 
 vronsky rolled with laughter and long afterward even when he was talking of other things he would go off into peals of his hearty laughter baring his strong closely set teeth whenever he thought of the casque 
 having learned all the news vronsky with the assistance of his valet got into his uniform and went off to report himself he intended afterward to go to his brother and to betsy and to pay several visits as an entering wedge into that society where he might meet madame karenina as always in peterburg he left home without any intention of returning before very late at night

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter vi 
 
 which possibly proves intelligence 
 on the afternoon of that same christmas day a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de in paris 
 this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg 
 we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter 
 this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what may be called the wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness 
 this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy he wore a very old and very well brushed round hat a coarse coat worn perfectly threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration 
 he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly white hair his wrinkled brow his livid lips and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life 
 judging from his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty 
 the wrinkles on his brow were well placed and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively 
 his lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe and which was humble 
 there was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel cut from some hedge this stick had been carefully trimmed and had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its knots and it had received a head made from red wax 
 it was a cudgel and it seemed to be a cane 
 there are but few on that boulevard particularly in the winter 
 the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this without any affectation 
 at that epoch king louis xviii 
 went nearly every day to it was one of his favorite excursions 
 towards two almost invariably the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the boulevard de 
 this served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said it is two there he is returning to the tuileries 
 and some rushed forward and others drew up in line for a passing king always creates a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii 
 produced a certain effect in the streets of paris it was rapid but majestic 
 this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop as he was not able to walk he wished to run 
 that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning 
 he passed pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords 
 his massive couch all covered with gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered noisily along 
 there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it 
 in the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large firm and ruddy face a brow freshly powdered a royal a proud hard crafty eye the smile of an educated man two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat the golden fleece the cross of saint louis the cross of the legion of honor the silver plaque of the a huge belly and a wide blue ribbon it was the king 
 outside of paris he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high english gaiters when he the city he put on his hat and saluted rarely he stared coldly at the people and they returned it in kind when he appeared for the first time in the quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is the government 
 this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was therefore the daily event of the boulevard de 
 the promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to this detail 
 when at two the royal carriage surrounded by a squadron of the all covered with silver lace debouched on the boulevard after having made the turn of the salpetriere he appeared surprised and almost alarmed there was no one but himself in this he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure though this did not prevent m le duc de havre from spying him out 
 m le duc de havre as captain of the guard on duty that day was seated in the carriage opposite the king 
 he said to his majesty yonder is an man 
 members of the police who were clearing the route took equal note of him one of them received an order to follow him 
 but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg and as twilight was beginning to fall the agent lost trace of him as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to m le comte minister of state prefect of police 
 when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track he redoubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed 
 at a four that is to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre of the porte where the two convicts was being played that day 
 this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it an instant later he was in the blind alley of la planchette and he entered the plat the pewter platter where the office of the coach for lagny was then situated 
 this coach set out at four 
 the horses were harnessed and the travellers summoned by the coachman were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle 
 the man inquired 
 have you a place 
 only me on the box said the coachman 
 i will take it 
 climb up 
 nevertheless before setting out the coachman cast a glance at the shabby dress at the diminutive size of his bundle and made him pay his fare 
 are you going as far as lagny demanded the coachman 
 yes said the man 
 the traveller paid to lagny 
 they started 
 when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in monosyllables 
 the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses 
 the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak 
 it was cold the man did not appear to be thinking of that 
 thus they passed gournay and 
 towards six in the evening they reached chelles 
 the coachman drew up in front of the carters inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey to give his horses a breathing spell 
 i get down here said the man 
 he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle 
 an instant later he had disappeared 
 he did not enter the inn 
 when the coach set out for lagny a few minutes later it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles 
 the coachman turned to the inside travellers 
 there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know him 
 he had not the air of owning a sou but he does not consider money he pays to lagny and he goes only as far as chelles it is night all the houses are shut he does not enter the inn and he is not to be found 
 so he has dived through the earth 
 the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the leading to montfermeil like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before 
 he followed this road rapidly 
 at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient road which runs from gagny to lagny he heard people coming 
 he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there waited until the were at a distance the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night 
 not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky 
 it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins 
 the man did not return to the road to montfermeil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides 
 once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision 
 at last he arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review a large tree covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts 
 opposite this tree which was an ash there was a suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing 
 he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc 
 then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed 
 that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest 
 it was the man who had just met cosette 
 as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on the ground then taking it up and setting out again he drew near and perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water 
 then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket

 chapter xvi 
 
 in april the troops were enlivened by news of the arrival but rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at bartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place 
 they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth hut dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table denisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a piece of broken but mended glass in it for a window when it was very cold embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the reception room as denisov called that part of the hut and it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always some with denisov and rostov sat in their shirt sleeves 
 in april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven and eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed his underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk 
 suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut evidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenko 
 i ordered you not to let them that mashka woot stuff denisov was shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields 
 i have given the order again and again your honor but they obey answered the quartermaster 
 rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let him fuss and bustle now my done and lying down capitally he could hear that lavrushka that sly bold orderly of was talking as well as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions 
 then voice was heard shouting farther and farther away saddle second platoon 
 where are they off to now thought rostov 
 five minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business 
 let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov going out and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud rostov joined them in the middle of the game the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them 
 there now denisov has been worrying said rostov and here are the provisions 
 so they are said the officers the soldiers be glad 
 a little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking 
 rostov went to meet them 
 i warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man evidently very angry was saying 
 i told you i give them up replied denisov 
 you will answer for it captain it is mutiny seizing the transport of own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days 
 and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov 
 it is robbery answer for it sir said the infantry officer raising his voice 
 now what are you pestewing me for cried denisov suddenly losing his temper i shall answer for it and not you and better not buzz about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted at the officers 
 very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding away if you are determined to rob 
 go to the devil quick while safe and sound and denisov turned his horse on the officer 
 very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle 
 a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst out laughing 
 taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all let our men starve 
 the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared them with the other squadrons 
 the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said 
 this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair may end badly 
 from the regimental denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in denisov could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked what was the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse feeble voice 
 alarmed at condition rostov suggested that he should undress drink some water and send for the doctor 
 twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but always thwash scoundwels and tell the empewo ice he muttered 
 the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him 
 i get there began denisov now then your quarters they were pointed out please to wait widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me vewy well so out comes their head chief also took it into his head to lecture me wobbewy wobbewy i say is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then he says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so you starving us to death is it take this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his snout ah what a what and i fwashing him well had a bit of fun i can tell you cried denisov gleeful and yet angry his showing under his black mustache have killed him if they taken him away 
 but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up again 
 denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and cheerful 
 but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into and dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about occurrence the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a had been appointed and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for 
 the case as represented by the offended parties was that after seizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them 
 in answer to renewed questions denisov said laughing that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget 
 denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew him too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he feared a and was worried over the affair which was evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rode out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital

 you will answer for it captain it is mutiny seizing the transport of own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days 
 and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov 
 it is robbery answer for it sir said the infantry officer raising his voice 
 now what are you pestewing me for cried denisov suddenly losing his temper i shall answer for it and not you and better not buzz about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted at the officers 
 very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding away if you are determined to rob 
 go to the devil quick while safe and sound and denisov turned his horse on the officer 
 very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle 
 a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst out laughing 
 taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all let our men starve 
 the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared them with the other squadrons 
 the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said 
 this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair may end badly 
 from the regimental denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him in denisov could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked what was the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse feeble voice 
 alarmed at condition rostov suggested that he should undress drink some water and send for the doctor 
 twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but always thwash scoundwels and tell the empewo ice he muttered 
 the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him 
 i get there began denisov now then your quarters they were pointed out please to wait widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me vewy well so out comes their head chief also took it into his head to lecture me wobbewy wobbewy i say is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then he says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so you starving us to death is it take this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his snout ah what a what and i fwashing him well had a bit of fun i can tell you cried denisov gleeful and yet angry his showing under his black mustache have killed him if they taken him away 
 but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostov set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up again 
 denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and cheerful 
 but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into and dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about occurrence the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a had been appointed and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for 
 the case as represented by the offended parties was that after seizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them 
 in answer to renewed questions denisov said laughing that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget 
 denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew him too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he feared a and was worried over the affair which was evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rode out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital

 cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark 
 cosette as we have said was not frightened 
 the man accosted her 
 he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass 
 my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you 
 cosette raised her head and replied 
 yes sir

 cosette let go of the the man walked along beside her 
 it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth then he added 
 how old are you little one 
 eight sir 
 and have you come from far like this 
 from the spring in the forest 
 are you going far 
 a good quarter of an walk from here 
 the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly 
 so you have no mother 
 i know answered the child 
 before the man had time to speak again she added 
 i think so 
 other people have mothers 
 i have none 
 and after a silence she went on 
 i think that i never had any 
 the man halted he set the bucket on the ground bent down and placed both hands on the shoulders making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark 
 thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky 
 what is your name said the man 
 cosette 
 the man seemed to have received an electric shock 
 he looked at her once more then he removed his hands from shoulders seized the bucket and set out again 
 after a moment he inquired 
 where do you live little one 
 at montfermeil if you know where that is 
 that is where we are going 
 yes sir 
 he paused then began again 
 who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest 
 it was madame thenardier 
 the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render indifferent but in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor 
 what does your madame thenardier do 
 she is my mistress said the child 
 she keeps the inn 
 the inn said the man 
 well i am going to lodge there show me the way 
 we are on the way there said the child 
 the man walked tolerably fast 
 cosette followed him without difficulty she no longer felt any fatigue 
 from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence 
 she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven 
 several minutes elapsed 
 the man resumed 
 is there no servant in madame house 
 no sir 
 are you alone there 
 yes sir 
 another pause ensued 
 cosette lifted up her voice 
 that is to say there are two little girls 
 what little girls 
 ponine and zelma 
 this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female thenardier 
 who are ponine and zelma 
 they are madame young ladies her daughters as you would say 
 and what do those girls do 
 oh said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in them all full of affairs 
 they play they amuse themselves 
 all day long 
 yes sir 
 and you 
 i 
 i work 
 all day long 
 the child raised her great eyes in which hung a tear which was not visible because of the darkness and replied gently 
 yes sir 
 after an interval of silence she went on 
 sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse myself too 
 how do you amuse yourself 
 in the best way i can 
 they let me alone but i have not many playthings 
 ponine and zelma will not let me play with their dolls 
 i have only a little lead sword no longer than that 
 the child held up her tiny finger 
 and it will not cut 
 yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies 
 they reached the village 
 cosette guided the stranger through the streets 
 they passed the bakeshop but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch 
 the man had ceased to ply her with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence 
 when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all the booths asked cosette 
 so there is a fair going on here 
 no sir it is christmas 
 as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm 
 monsieur 
 what my child 
 we are quite near the house 
 well 
 will you let me take my bucket now 
 why 
 if madame sees that some one has carried it for me she will beat me 
 the man handed her the bucket 
 an instant later they were at the tavern door

 book five 
 chapter xvii 
 
 in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds did not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov who felt his absence very much having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov in hospital 
 the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about 
 the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard 
 directly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant 
 i tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar alexeevich in the evening i shall be there 
 the assistant asked some further questions 
 oh do the best you can it all the same the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs 
 what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bullets having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir 
 how so asked rostov 
 typhus sir death to go in only we two makeev and i he pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been invited here but our allies like it at all 
 rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who was wounded 
 i know i tell you sir only think i am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sir and always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh he asked turning to the assistant 
 the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go 
 major denisov rostov said again he was wounded at molliten 
 dead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of indifference 
 the assistant however did not confirm the words 
 is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor 
 rostov described appearance 
 there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one is dead i fancy however look up our list we had a list have you got it makeev 
 makar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but if step into the officers wards see for yourself he added turning to rostov 
 ah better not go sir said the doctor or you may have to stay here yourself 
 but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way 
 only blame me the doctor shouted up after him 
 rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so strong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and an emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostov saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats 
 may i go in and look 
 what is there to see said the assistant 
 but just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in rostov entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was a little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it originated 
 in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at rostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envy of health rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judge by the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legs outstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating rostov listened and made out the word it was drink drink a drink rostov glanced round looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water 
 who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant 
 just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostov 
 good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities 
 get him to his place and give him some water said rostov pointing to the cossack 
 yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not move 
 no impossible to do anything here thought rostov lowering his eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right and he turned close to the corner on an overcoat sat an old unshaven soldier as thin as a skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostov the neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostov who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputated above the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back 
 why this one seems he began turning to the assistant 
 and how been begging your honor said the old soldier his jaw quivering been dead since morning after all men not dogs 
 send someone at once he shall be taken away taken away at once said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honor 
 yes yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering his eyes and shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter viii 
 
 the unpleasantness of receiving into house a poor man who may be a rich man 
 cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the then she knocked the door opened 
 the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand 
 ah so you you little wretch good mercy but taken your time 
 the hussy has been amusing herself 
 madame said cosette trembling all over a gentleman who wants a lodging 
 the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to and eagerly sought the with her eyes 
 this is the gentleman said she 
 yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat 
 wealthy travellers are not so polite 
 this gesture and an inspection of the costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear 
 she resumed dryly 
 enter my good man 
 the good man entered 
 the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar 
 thereupon the thenardier exclaimed 
 ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left 
 put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i will pay as though i occupied a room 
 forty sous 
 forty sous agreed 
 very well then 
 forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous 
 it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i lodge poor folks for less 
 true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such people in it 
 in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass 
 the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting 
 the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention 
 cosette was ugly 
 if she had been happy she might have been pretty we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six 
 her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping 
 the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people 
 her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains 
 the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent 
 as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter 
 all she had on was linen not a scrap of woollen 
 her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her her naked legs were thin and red 
 the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep 
 this whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole 
 fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except an increase 
 in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked 
 her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again 
 the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon 
 as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church 
 have i the time said the thenardier 
 the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette 
 all at once the thenardier exclaimed 
 by the way that bread 
 cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table 
 she had completely forgotten the bread 
 she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied 
 madame the shop was shut 
 you should have knocked 
 i did knock madame 
 well 
 he did not open the door 
 find out whether that is true said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie lead you a pretty dance in the meantime give me back my piece 
 cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green the piece was not there 
 ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me 
 cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what could have become of that money 
 the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say 
 she was petrified 
 have you lost that piece screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it 
 at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the which hung on a nail in the 
 this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek 
 mercy madame madame 
 i will not do so any more 
 the thenardier took down the whip 
 in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything 
 cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor limbs 
 the thenardier raised her arm 
 pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little apron pocket and rolled aside 
 perhaps this is it 
 at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment 
 exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up 
 and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier 
 yes it said she 
 it was not it for it was a piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage 
 she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark let this ever happen again 
 cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it 
 by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the traveller 
 he made no reply 
 he appeared to be absorbed in thought 
 what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth some frightfully poor wretch 
 he a sou to pay for a supper 
 will he even pay me for his lodging 
 very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor 
 in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered 
 they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye 
 they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement 
 there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced 
 light emanated from these two little beings besides this they were on the throne 
 in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration ah there you are you children 
 then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons afresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are 
 they went and seated themselves in the they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter 
 from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air 
 eponine and azelma did not look at cosette 
 she was the same as a dog to them 
 these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other 
 the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none the less admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand 
 all at once the thenardier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play 
 ah 
 caught you at it she cried 
 so the way you work make you work to the tune of the whip that i will 
 the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair 
 bah madame he said with an almost timid air let her play 
 such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order 
 but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate 
 she retorted with acrimony 
 she must work since she eats 
 i feed her to do nothing 
 what is she making went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his shoulders 
 the thenardier deigned to reply 
 stockings if you please 
 stockings for my little girls who have none so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now 
 the man looked at poor little red feet and continued 
 when will she have finished this pair of stockings 
 she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy creature 
 and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them 
 the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him 
 thirty sous at least 
 will you sell them for five francs went on the man 
 good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs the deuce i should think so five balls 
 thenardier thought it time to strike in 
 yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs 
 we can refuse nothing to travellers 
 you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion 
 i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them 
 then he turned to cosette 
 now i own your work play my child 
 the carter was so much touched by the piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up 
 but true he cried examining it 
 a real hind wheel and not counterfeit 
 thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket 
 the thenardier had no reply to make 
 she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred 
 in the meantime cosette was trembling 
 she ventured to ask 
 is it true madame 
 may i play 
 play said the thenardier in a terrible voice 
 thanks madame said cosette 
 and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller 
 thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear 
 who can this yellow man be 
 i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in a sovereign manner 
 cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat cosette always moved as little as possible 
 she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her 
 eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat 
 they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps 
 while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast 
 you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists she cries she is warm 
 see sister let us play with her she shall be my little girl 
 i will be a lady 
 i will come to see you and you shall look at her 
 gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you 
 and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl 
 little girls are made like that just at present 
 azelma listened admiringly to eponine 
 in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook 
 thenardier accompanied and encouraged them 
 as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand 
 while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep 
 the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is some lies the whole future 
 while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman 
 the first child is the continuation of the last doll 
 a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children 
 so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword 
 madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men 
 she came and set her elbows on the table 
 monsieur said she 
 at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme 
 you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous 
 you see she has nothing she must needs work 
 then this child is not yours demanded the man 
 oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child 
 she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see 
 we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead 
 ah said the man and fell into his revery once more 
 her mother amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned her child 
 during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there 
 meanwhile the drinkers all intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced 
 the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter 
 cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes 
 she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead my mother is dead my mother is dead 
 on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consented at last to take supper 
 what does monsieur wish 
 bread and cheese said the man 
 decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier 
 the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing hers 
 all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table 
 then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room 
 madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it 
 an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness 
 no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper 
 this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour 
 but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly 
 that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine look sister 
 the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll 
 eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt 
 let me alone said her mother what do you want 
 mother said the child look there 
 and she pointed to cosette 
 cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything 
 madame countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras 
 on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies 
 a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial blue ribbon would wear no other face 
 she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation 
 cosette 
 cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round 
 cosette repeated the thenardier 
 cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung them one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing 
 meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet 
 what is the matter he said to the thenardier 
 you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at feet 
 well what of it resumed the man 
 that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch the doll 
 all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play with that doll 
 she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands 
 here cosette redoubled her sobs 
 will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier 
 the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out 
 as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries 
 the door opened again the man he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying 
 
 here this is for you 
 it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop lighted up by and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the 
 cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall 
 she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe 
 the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room 
 madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who is that old fellow 
 is he a poor man 
 is he a millionaire perhaps he is both that is to say a thief 
 the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force 
 the stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice 
 that machine costs at least thirty francs 
 no nonsense down on your belly before that man 
 gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state 
 well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women you going to take your doll 
 cosette ventured to emerge from her hole 
 the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air 
 take it it is yours 
 cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy 
 what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france 
 it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it 
 this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her 
 nevertheless the attraction carried the day 
 she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier 
 may i madame 
 no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic 
 pardi cried the thenardier it is yours 
 the gentleman has given it to you 
 truly sir said cosette 
 is it true 
 is the lady mine 
 the eyes seemed to be full of tears 
 he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep 
 he nodded to cosette and placed the hand in her tiny hand 
 cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor 
 we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport 
 i shall call her catherine she said 
 it was an odd moment when rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll 
 madame she resumed may i put her on a chair 
 yes my child replied the thenardier 
 it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy 
 cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation 
 play cosette said the stranger 
 oh 
 i am playing returned the child 
 this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment 
 however it was necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure 
 she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms 
 from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud 
 old beast 
 what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner 
 to want that little monster to play to give away dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would 
 a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry 
 is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old fellow 
 why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her play 
 all right 
 a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it 
 if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you 
 if he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for so long as he has money 
 the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply 
 the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude 
 all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed man who drew from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared 
 many hours passed 
 the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude 
 from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned 
 that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room 
 the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in the room 
 is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the thenardier when two in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband going to bed 
 do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais 
 a good hour passed thus 
 the worthy had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the name 
 the stranger did not stir 
 thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his chair 
 not a movement on the part 
 is he asleep thought thenardier 
 the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him 
 at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say 
 is not monsieur going to his repose 
 not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to repose smacked of luxury and respect 
 these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day 
 a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs 
 well said the stranger you are right 
 where is your stable 
 sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i will conduct you sir 
 he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico 
 what is this said the traveller 
 it is really our bridal chamber said the my wife and i occupy another 
 this is only entered three or four times a year 
 i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly 
 thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark 
 he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the a very good fire was flickering on the hearth 
 on the under a glass globe stood a in silver wire and orange flowers 
 and what is this resumed the stranger 
 that sir said thenardier is my wedding bonnet 
 the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden 
 thenardier lied however 
 when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house 
 when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning 
 the retired to his room 
 his wife was in bed but she was not asleep 
 when she heard her step she turned over and said to him 
 do you know going to turn cosette out of doors 
 thenardier replied coldly 
 how you do go on 
 they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished 
 as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner 
 the landlord once gone he threw himself into an and remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase 
 there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet 
 no sheets this was placed on the floor 
 in this bed cosette was sleeping 
 the man approached and gazed down upon her 
 cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed 
 in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold 
 against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark 
 from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms 
 beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes 
 a door which stood open near pallet permitted a view of a rather large dark room 
 the stranger stepped into it at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds 
 they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep 
 the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair 
 he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at 
 there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the gaze nevertheless 
 it was two tiny shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size 
 the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth 
 the traveller bent over them 
 the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a and shining piece 
 the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object 
 he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud 
 it was sabot cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the also 
 hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing 
 there was nothing in this wooden shoe 
 the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis in shoe 
 then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf

 book of the promise made to the dead woman 
 chapter viii 
 
 the unpleasantness of receiving into house a poor man who may be a rich man 
 cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the then she knocked the door opened 
 the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand 
 ah so you you little wretch good mercy but taken your time 
 the hussy has been amusing herself 
 madame said cosette trembling all over a gentleman who wants a lodging 
 the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to and eagerly sought the with her eyes 
 this is the gentleman said she 
 yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat 
 wealthy travellers are not so polite 
 this gesture and an inspection of the costume and baggage which the thenardier passed in review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear 
 she resumed dryly 
 enter my good man 
 the good man entered 
 the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar 
 thereupon the thenardier exclaimed 
 ah see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left 
 put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable i will pay as though i occupied a room 
 forty sous 
 forty sous agreed 
 very well then 
 forty sous said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous 
 it is forty in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone i lodge poor folks for less 
 true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such people in it 
 in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass 
 the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting 
 the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention 
 cosette was ugly 
 if she had been happy she might have been pretty we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six 
 her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping 
 the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people 
 her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chilblains 
 the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent 
 as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter 
 all she had on was linen not a scrap of woollen 
 her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her her naked legs were thin and red 
 the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep 
 this whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole 
 fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except an increase 
 in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked 
 her fear was such that on her arrival wet as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again 
 the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon 
 as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church 
 have i the time said the thenardier 
 the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette 
 all at once the thenardier exclaimed 
 by the way that bread 
 cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table 
 she had completely forgotten the bread 
 she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear she lied 
 madame the shop was shut 
 you should have knocked 
 i did knock madame 
 well 
 he did not open the door 
 find out whether that is true said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie lead you a pretty dance in the meantime give me back my piece 
 cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green the piece was not there 
 ah come now said madame thenardier did you hear me 
 cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it what could have become of that money 
 the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say 
 she was petrified 
 have you lost that piece screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it 
 at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the which hung on a nail in the 
 this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek 
 mercy madame madame 
 i will not do so any more 
 the thenardier took down the whip 
 in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything 
 cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor limbs 
 the thenardier raised her arm 
 pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little apron pocket and rolled aside 
 perhaps this is it 
 at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment 
 exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up 
 and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier 
 yes it said she 
 it was not it for it was a piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage 
 she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark let this ever happen again 
 cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it 
 by the way would you like some supper the thenardier inquired of the traveller 
 he made no reply 
 he appeared to be absorbed in thought 
 what sort of a man is that she muttered between her teeth some frightfully poor wretch 
 he a sou to pay for a supper 
 will he even pay me for his lodging 
 very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor 
 in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and azelma entered 
 they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious neat plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye 
 they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement 
 there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced 
 light emanated from these two little beings besides this they were on the throne 
 in their toilettes in their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration ah there you are you children 
 then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons afresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are 
 they went and seated themselves in the they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter 
 from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air 
 eponine and azelma did not look at cosette 
 she was the same as a dog to them 
 these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other 
 the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none the less admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand 
 all at once the thenardier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play 
 ah 
 caught you at it she cried 
 so the way you work make you work to the tune of the whip that i will 
 the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair 
 bah madame he said with an almost timid air let her play 
 such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order 
 but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate 
 she retorted with acrimony 
 she must work since she eats 
 i feed her to do nothing 
 what is she making went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his shoulders 
 the thenardier deigned to reply 
 stockings if you please 
 stockings for my little girls who have none so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now 
 the man looked at poor little red feet and continued 
 when will she have finished this pair of stockings 
 she has at least three or four good days work on them still the lazy creature 
 and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them 
 the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him 
 thirty sous at least 
 will you sell them for five francs went on the man 
 good heavens exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs the deuce i should think so five balls 
 thenardier thought it time to strike in 
 yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs 
 we can refuse nothing to travellers 
 you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion 
 i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them 
 then he turned to cosette 
 now i own your work play my child 
 the carter was so much touched by the piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up 
 but true he cried examining it 
 a real hind wheel and not counterfeit 
 thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket 
 the thenardier had no reply to make 
 she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred 
 in the meantime cosette was trembling 
 she ventured to ask 
 is it true madame 
 may i play 
 play said the thenardier in a terrible voice 
 thanks madame said cosette 
 and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller 
 thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear 
 who can this yellow man be 
 i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied thenardier in a sovereign manner 
 cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat cosette always moved as little as possible 
 she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her 
 eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat 
 they had thrown their doll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of its mewing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps 
 while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast 
 you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other she twists she cries she is warm 
 see sister let us play with her she shall be my little girl 
 i will be a lady 
 i will come to see you and you shall look at her 
 gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you 
 and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you and you will say to me ah mon dieu and i will say to you yes madame it is my little girl 
 little girls are made like that just at present 
 azelma listened admiringly to eponine 
 in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook 
 thenardier accompanied and encouraged them 
 as birds make nests out of everything so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand 
 while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to lull it to sleep 
 the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to dandle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is some lies the whole future 
 while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman 
 the first child is the continuation of the last doll 
 a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children 
 so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword 
 madame thenardier approached the yellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m laffitte there are such queer rich men 
 she came and set her elbows on the table 
 monsieur said she 
 at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme 
 you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous 
 you see she has nothing she must needs work 
 then this child is not yours demanded the man 
 oh mon dieu no sir she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child 
 she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see 
 we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months it must be that her mother is dead 
 ah said the man and fell into his revery once more 
 her mother amount to much added the thenardier she abandoned her child 
 during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not taken her eyes from the face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there 
 meanwhile the drinkers all intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced 
 the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter 
 cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes 
 she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead my mother is dead my mother is dead 
 on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consented at last to take supper 
 what does monsieur wish 
 bread and cheese said the man 
 decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier 
 the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing hers 
 all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers doll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table 
 then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room 
 madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money ponine and zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it 
 an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness 
 no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper 
 this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour 
 but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly 
 that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of azelma who said to eponine look sister 
 the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll 
 eponine rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt 
 let me alone said her mother what do you want 
 mother said the child look there 
 and she pointed to cosette 
 cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything 
 madame countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras 
 on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies 
 a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial blue ribbon would wear no other face 
 she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation 
 cosette 
 cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round 
 cosette repeated the thenardier 
 cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung them one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing 
 meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet 
 what is the matter he said to the thenardier 
 you see said the thenardier pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at feet 
 well what of it resumed the man 
 that beggar replied the thenardier has permitted herself to touch the doll 
 all this noise for that said the man well what if she did play with that doll 
 she touched it with her dirty hands pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands 
 here cosette redoubled her sobs 
 will you stop your noise screamed the thenardier 
 the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out 
 as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries 
 the door opened again the man he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying 
 
 here this is for you 
 it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop lighted up by and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the 
 cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and hid herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall 
 she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe 
 the thenardier eponine and azelma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room 
 madame thenardier petrified and mute recommenced her conjectures who is that old fellow 
 is he a poor man 
 is he a millionaire perhaps he is both that is to say a thief 
 the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force 
 the stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice 
 that machine costs at least thirty francs 
 no nonsense down on your belly before that man 
 gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state 
 well cosette said the thenardier in a voice that strove to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women you going to take your doll 
 cosette ventured to emerge from her hole 
 the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air 
 take it it is yours 
 cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy 
 what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france 
 it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it 
 this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her 
 nevertheless the attraction carried the day 
 she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier 
 may i madame 
 no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic 
 pardi cried the thenardier it is yours 
 the gentleman has given it to you 
 truly sir said cosette 
 is it true 
 is the lady mine 
 the eyes seemed to be full of tears 
 he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep 
 he nodded to cosette and placed the hand in her tiny hand 
 cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor 
 we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport 
 i shall call her catherine she said 
 it was an odd moment when rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll 
 madame she resumed may i put her on a chair 
 yes my child replied the thenardier 
 it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy 
 cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation 
 play cosette said the stranger 
 oh 
 i am playing returned the child 
 this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment 
 however it was necessary to control herself habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure 
 she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms 
 from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud 
 old beast 
 what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner 
 to want that little monster to play to give away dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous so i would 
 a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry 
 is there any sense in it is he mad then that mysterious old fellow 
 why it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work it amuses him to have her play 
 all right 
 a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it 
 if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you 
 if he is an imbecile it does not concern you what are you worrying for so long as he has money 
 the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply 
 the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude 
 all the other travellers both pedlers and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe this poorly dressed man who drew from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared 
 many hours passed 
 the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude 
 from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned 
 that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room 
 the thenardiers alone out of politeness and curiosity had remained in the room 
 is he going to pass the night in that fashion grumbled the thenardier when two in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband going to bed 
 do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais 
 a good hour passed thus 
 the worthy had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the name 
 the stranger did not stir 
 thenardier fidgeted coughed spit blew his nose and creaked his chair 
 not a movement on the part 
 is he asleep thought thenardier 
 the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse him 
 at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say 
 is not monsieur going to his repose 
 not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar to repose smacked of luxury and respect 
 these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day 
 a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs 
 well said the stranger you are right 
 where is your stable 
 sir exclaimed thenardier with a smile i will conduct you sir 
 he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico 
 what is this said the traveller 
 it is really our bridal chamber said the my wife and i occupy another 
 this is only entered three or four times a year 
 i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly 
 thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark 
 he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the a very good fire was flickering on the hearth 
 on the under a glass globe stood a in silver wire and orange flowers 
 and what is this resumed the stranger 
 that sir said thenardier is my wedding bonnet 
 the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden 
 thenardier lied however 
 when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house 
 when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning 
 the retired to his room 
 his wife was in bed but she was not asleep 
 when she heard her step she turned over and said to him 
 do you know going to turn cosette out of doors 
 thenardier replied coldly 
 how you do go on 
 they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished 
 as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner 
 the landlord once gone he threw himself into an and remained for some time buried in thought then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room gazing about him like a person who is in search of something he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase 
 there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds among dust and spiders webs was a one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet 
 no sheets this was placed on the floor 
 in this bed cosette was sleeping 
 the man approached and gazed down upon her 
 cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed 
 in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold 
 against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark 
 from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms 
 beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes 
 a door which stood open near pallet permitted a view of a rather large dark room 
 the stranger stepped into it at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds 
 they belonged to eponine and azelma behind these beds and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep 
 the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair 
 he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at 
 there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the gaze nevertheless 
 it was two tiny shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size 
 the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth 
 the traveller bent over them 
 the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a and shining piece 
 the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when far in in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object 
 he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoe a frightful shoe of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud 
 it was sabot cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the also 
 hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing 
 there was nothing in this wooden shoe 
 the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed a louis in shoe 
 then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf

 going along the corridor the assistant led rostov to the officers wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open there were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns the first person rostov met in the officers ward was a thin little man with one arm who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teeth rostov looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him before 
 see where met again said the little man tushin tushin you remember who gave you a lift at schon grabern and had a bit cut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich denisov my neighbor he added when he heard who rostov wanted here here and tushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several laughing voices 
 how can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostov still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back 
 denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though it was nearly noon 
 ah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in the same voice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of face and the intonations of his voice 
 his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostov what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about the general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters did not listen 
 rostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of the regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who had gathered round rostov a fresh arrival from the world outside gradually began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe and little tushin still listened shaking his head disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted denisov 
 but what i say is he said turning to rostov it would be best simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards will now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted 
 me petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i would ask mercy but being for bwinging wobbers to book let them twy me not afwaid of anyone served the tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwaded listen to them stwaight this is what i say if i had wobbed the tweasuwy 
 certainly well written said tushin but not the point vasili dmitrich and he also turned to rostov one has to submit and vasili dmitrich want to you know the auditor told you it was a bad business 
 well let it be bad said denisov 
 the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he indicating rostov has connections on the staff you find a better opportunity 
 i said not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went on reading his paper 
 rostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper 
 when the reading of virulent reply which took more than an hour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid hospital comrades who had round him telling them what he knew and listening to their stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening 
 late in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisov whether he had no commission for him 
 yes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he had an inkpot and sat down to write 
 it seems no use knocking head against a wall he said coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply asked for pardon 
 hand it in it seems 
 he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile

 the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he indicating rostov has connections on the staff you find a better opportunity 
 i said not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went on reading his paper 
 rostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper 
 when the reading of virulent reply which took more than an hour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid hospital comrades who had round him telling them what he knew and listening to their stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening 
 late in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisov whether he had no commission for him 
 yes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he had an inkpot and sat down to write 
 it seems no use knocking head against a wall he said coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply asked for pardon 
 hand it in it seems 
 he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile

 chapter ix 
 
 thenardier and his manoeuvres 
 on the following morning two hours at least before thenardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern pen in hand was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat 
 his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following him with her eyes 
 they exchanged not a word 
 on the one hand there was profound meditation on the other the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind 
 a noise was audible in the house it was the lark sweeping the stairs 
 after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures thenardier produced the following masterpiece 
 bill of the gentleman in no 
 supper francs 
 chamber 
 candle 
 fire 
 service 
 total francs 
 service was written servisse 
 francs cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation 
 like all great artists thenardier was dissatisfied 
 peuh he exclaimed 
 it was the accent of castlereagh auditing bill at the congress of vienna 
 monsieur thenardier you are right he certainly owes that murmured the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters 
 it is just but it is too much he will not pay it 
 thenardier laughed coldly as usual and said 
 he will pay 
 this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so 
 his wife did not insist 
 she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room a moment later he added 
 i owe full fifteen hundred francs 
 he went and seated himself in the meditating with his feet among the warm ashes 
 ah by the way resumed his wife you forget that going to turn cosette out of doors the monster 
 she breaks my heart with that doll of hers 
 rather marry louis xviii than keep her another day in the house 
 thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs 
 you will hand that bill to the man 
 then he went out 
 hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered 
 thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the door visible only to his wife 
 the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand 
 up so early said madame thenardier is monsieur leaving us already 
 as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples 
 to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her 
 the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and he replied 
 yes madame i am going 
 so monsieur has no business in montfermeil 
 no i was passing through 
 that is all 
 what do i owe you madame he added 
 the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill 
 the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere 
 madame he resumed is business good here in montfermeil 
 so so monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion 
 she continued in a dreary and lamentable tone 
 oh 
 monsieur times are so hard and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood 
 all the people are poor you see 
 if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all 
 we have so many expenses 
 just see that child is costing us our very eyes 
 what child 
 why the little one you know 
 lark as she is called hereabouts 
 ah said the man 
 she went on 
 how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames 
 she has more the air of a bat than of a lark 
 you see sir we do not ask charity and we cannot bestow it 
 we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal 
 the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths 
 monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money 
 and then i have my daughters i have no need to bring up other children 
 the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render indifferent and in which there lingered a tremor 
 what if one were to rid you of her 
 who 
 cosette 
 yes 
 the red and violent face brightened up hideously 
 ah sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her eat her and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you 
 agreed 
 really 
 you will take her away 
 i will take her away 
 immediately 
 immediately 
 call the child 
 cosette screamed the thenardier 
 in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you how much is it 
 he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise 
 francs 
 he looked at the landlady and repeated 
 francs 
 there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point 
 the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock she replied with assurance 
 good gracious yes sir it is francs 
 the stranger laid five pieces on the table 
 go and get the child said he 
 at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and said 
 monsieur owes sous 
 sous exclaimed his wife 
 twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous for his supper 
 as for the child i must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman 
 leave us wife 
 madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent 
 she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room 
 as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of and simplicity 
 sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child 
 the stranger gazed intently at him 
 what child 
 thenardier continued 
 how strange it is one grows attached 
 what money is that take back your piece 
 i adore the child 
 whom do you mean demanded the stranger 
 eh our little cosette 
 are you not intending to take her away from us 
 well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it 
 i shall miss that child 
 i saw her first when she was a tiny thing 
 it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses 
 but one must do something for the good sake 
 she has neither father nor mother i have brought her up 
 i have bread enough for her and for myself in truth i think a great deal of that child 
 you understand one conceives an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is but she loves her also 
 you see she is just the same as our own child 
 i want to keep her to babble about the house 
 the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier the latter continued 
 excuse me sir but one does not give away child to a like that 
 i am right am i not 
 still i say you are rich you have the air of a very good it were for her happiness 
 but one must find out that 
 you understand suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good is alive that he is watching over her in short there are things which are not possible 
 i do not even know your name 
 if you were to take her away i should say well and the lark what has become of her 
 one must at least see some petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know 
 the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice 
 monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris 
 if i take cosette away i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter 
 you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives 
 i break the thread which binds her foot and she departs 
 does that suit you 
 yes or no 
 since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person 
 it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude 
 while drinking with the carters smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing 
 not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the yellow had escaped him even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his purpose 
 he had caught the old deep glances returning constantly to the child who was this man 
 why this interest 
 why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse 
 questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him he had pondered it all night long 
 he could not be father was he her grandfather 
 then why not make himself known at once when one has a right one asserts it 
 this man evidently had no right over cosette 
 what was it then 
 thenardier lost himself in conjectures 
 he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing be that as it may on entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way he became conscious that he was weak 
 he had expected nothing of the sort 
 his conjectures were put to the rout 
 he rallied his ideas 
 he weighed everything in the space of a second thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that 
 he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries 
 sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs 
 the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather opened it drew out three which he laid on the table then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the 
 go and fetch cosette 
 while this was taking place what had cosette been doing 
 on waking up cosette had run to get her shoe 
 in it she had found the gold piece 
 it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath cosette was dazzled 
 her destiny began to intoxicate her she did not know what a gold piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it still she felt that it really was hers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear she was happy above all she was stupefied 
 such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real 
 the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her 
 she trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence 
 the stranger alone did not frighten her on the contrary he reassured her 
 ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind 
 everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest cosette less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven had never known what it was to take refuge under a shadow and under a wing 
 for the last five years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had shivered and trembled she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed 
 formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm 
 cosette was no longer afraid of the thenardier 
 she was no longer alone there was some one there 
 she hastily set about her regular morning duties 
 that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told 
 as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket 
 it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her 
 she had gone in search of cosette at her orders 
 what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her 
 cosette she said almost gently come immediately 
 an instant later cosette entered the public room 
 the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it this bundle contained a little woollen gown an apron a fustian bodice a kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings complete outfit for a girl of seven years 
 all was black 
 my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly 
 daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a pink doll in her arms pass along the road to paris 
 they were going in the direction of livry 
 it was our man and cosette 
 no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rags many did not recognize her 
 cosette was going away 
 with whom 
 she did not know 
 whither 
 she knew not 
 all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her 
 no one had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one 
 she was leaving that hated and hating house 
 poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour 
 cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky 
 she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron 
 from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the good man 
 she felt something as though she were beside the good god

 book five 
 chapter xix 
 
 having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor 
 on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in tilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at tilsit 
 i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte 
 you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling 
 boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested 
 i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the general patted him on the shoulder with a smile 
 you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him 
 boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the niemen awaiting arrival saw both emperors get into boats and saw how napoleon reaching the raft first stepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts he felt to be of historic importance as the suite was a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the latter knew his face and all those at court far from him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been surprised had he been absent

 on the evening of the of june count zhilinski arranged a supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an of there were also several french officers of the guard and a page of a young lad of an old aristocratic french family that same day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by boris and zhilinski 
 rostov in common with the whole army from which he came was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the french who from being foes had suddenly become friends that had taken place at headquarters and in boris in the army bonaparte and the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and fear only recently talking with one of cossack officers rostov had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rostov had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers in boris lodging dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskoy lived there boris hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing rostov 
 ah you very glad very glad to see you he said however coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his first impulse 
 come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have business he said coldly 
 no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment dans un moment je suis a vous he said answering someone who called him 
 in a minute i shall be at your disposal 
 i see intruding rostov repeated 
 the look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris face having evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking serenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by something as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostov 
 oh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said boris and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar officer and an old friend of his 
 count zhilinski le comte n n le capitaine s s said he naming his guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed reluctantly and remained silent 
 zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmen with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the obstinately taciturn rostov saying that the latter had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor 
 no i came on business replied rostov briefly 
 rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on boris face and as always happens to those in a bad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in way he really was in their way for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general the looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting here for he rose and went up to boris 
 anyhow in your way he said in a low tone come and talk over my business and go away 
 oh no not at all said boris but if you are tired come and lie down in my room and have a rest 
 yes really 
 they went into the little room where boris slept rostov without sitting down began at once irritably as if boris were to blame in some way telling him about affair asking him whether through his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on behalf and get petition handed in when he and boris were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not look boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness boris with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into eyes with the same veiled look each time this happened rostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes 
 i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in general i think 
 so you want to do anything well then say so rostov almost shouted not looking boris in the face 
 boris smiled 
 on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought 
 at that moment voice was heard calling boris 
 well then go go go said rostov and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room

 having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor 
 on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in tilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at tilsit 
 i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte 
 you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling 
 boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested 
 i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the general patted him on the shoulder with a smile 
 you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him 
 boris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the niemen awaiting arrival saw both emperors get into boats and saw how napoleon reaching the raft first stepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the highest circles boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts he felt to be of historic importance as the suite was a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the latter knew his face and all those at court far from him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been surprised had he been absent 
 boris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinski zhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately fond of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and lunching with him and boris

 he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse 
 madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was her wont 
 she had expected great results 
 when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs 
 is that all said she 
 it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the acts 
 the blow told 
 you are right in sooth said he i am a fool 
 give me my hat 
 he folded up the three thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while 
 that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal first he gave twenty sous then five francs then fifty francs then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness 
 he would have given fifteen thousand francs 
 but i shall overtake him 
 and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it one does not let mysteries out of hand when one has once grasped them 
 the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold one must know how to subject them to pressure 
 all these thoughts whirled through his brain 
 i am an animal said he 
 when one leaves montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to livry it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau 
 on arriving there he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child 
 he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time 
 some informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny 
 he hastened in that direction 
 they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country 
 all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps 
 i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself 
 thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them 
 it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged 
 in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being given certain shocks arriving to bring his to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard 
 he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster 
 satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt and have fallen in the presence of this hideous masterpiece 
 after a momentary hesitation 
 bah he thought they will have time to make their escape 
 and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges 
 in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelles he caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that hat 
 the brushwood was not high 
 thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there 
 the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible 
 thenardier was not mistaken 
 the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat rested 
 the walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of 
 pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs 
 so saying he handed the stranger the three 
 the man raised his eyes 
 what is the meaning of this 
 thenardier replied respectfully 
 
 it means sir that i shall take back cosette 
 cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man 
 he replied gazing to the very bottom of eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly 
 you are to take back 
 yes sir i am 
 i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact i have not the right to give her to you 
 i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother 
 you will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear 
 the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier beheld the of make its appearance once more 
 the shivered with joy 
 good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me 
 before opening the the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley 
 the man opened his once more and drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the saying 
 you are right read 
 thenardier took the paper and read 
 m sur m march 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 you know that signature resumed the man 
 it certainly was signature thenardier recognized it 
 there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten the man added 
 you may keep this paper as your receipt 
 thenardier retreated in tolerably good order 
 this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go 
 then he essayed a desperate effort 
 it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things 
 a great deal is owing to me 
 the man rose to his feet filliping the dust from his sleeve 
 monsieur thenardier in january last the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs 
 in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and francs you had received one hundred francs too much that makes still owing you 
 i have just given you fifteen hundred francs 
 sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap 
 who is this devil of a man he thought 
 he did what the wolf does 
 he shook himself 
 audacity had succeeded with him once 
 he said resolutely and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns 
 the stranger said tranquilly 
 come cosette 
 he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground 
 thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot 
 the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the motionless and speechless 
 while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists 
 then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands 
 i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting 
 however the did not give up 
 i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow them at a distance 
 two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs 
 the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy he walked slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness 
 the winter had thinned out the forest so that thenardier did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed 
 all at once he caught sight of thenardier he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette where they could both hide themselves 
 the deuce said thenardier and he redoubled his pace 
 the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled round 
 it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him the man cast upon him an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course 
 the set out again in pursuit thus they continued for two or three hundred paces 
 all at once the man turned round once more he saw the this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further 
 thenardier retraced his steps

 rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so and boris even had he wished to could not have done so on the following day on that day june the preliminaries of peace were signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet 
 rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets with hugh monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed 
 boris want to help me and i want to ask him settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i leave here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged 
 saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out 
 i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go in all nonsense go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house 
 no i miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the house 
 a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the lower floor 
 whom do you want someone inquired 
 to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a tremor in his voice 
 a petition this way to the officer the officer on duty he was shown the door leading downstairs only it be accepted 
 on hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostov entered 
 a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome braces that for some reason attracted attention this man was was speaking to someone in the adjoining room 
 a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing rostov he stopped short and frowned 
 what is it a petition 
 what is it asked the person in the other room 
 another petitioner answered the man with the braces 
 tell him to come later be coming out directly we must go 
 later later tomorrow too late 
 rostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped him 
 whom have you come from who are you 
 i come from major denisov answered rostov 
 are you an officer 
 lieutenant count rostov 
 what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him 
 rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass 
 cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him 
 what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice 
 it was a cavalry general who had obtained the special favor during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving 
 rostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the general knew having heard rostov to the end the general shook his head gravely 
 sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter 
 hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the gentlemen of the suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in soul in all its old force in the uniform of the preobrazhensk regiment white breeches and high boots and wearing a star rostov did not know it was that of the legion the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of division smiled and beckoned to him 
 all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some time to the emperor 
 the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all 
 i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i and he raised his foot to the stirrup 
 the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostov ran after him with the crowd

 rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so and boris even had he wished to could not have done so on the following day on that day june the preliminaries of peace were signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet 
 rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets with hugh monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed 
 boris want to help me and i want to ask him settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i leave here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged 
 saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out 
 i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go in all nonsense go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house 
 no i miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the house 
 a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the lower floor 
 whom do you want someone inquired 
 to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a tremor in his voice 
 a petition this way to the officer the officer on duty he was shown the door leading downstairs only it be accepted 
 on hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostov entered

 the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in their bearskin caps on the left 
 as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his eye could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted hurrah and vive napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each hands face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him 
 in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were pushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him 
 alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he might be recognized 
 sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating every letter 
 this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and bending his head smiled pleasantly 
 to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance exasperating to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their emperor 
 will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the battalion 
 bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand tore it in doing so and threw it away an behind him rushed forward and picked it up 
 to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski in russian in a low voice 
 to whomever your majesty commands 
 the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back remarked 
 but we must give him an answer 
 kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostov in his scrutiny 
 can it be me thought rostov 
 lazarev the colonel called with a frown and lazarev the first soldier in the rank stepped briskly forward 
 where are you off to stop here voices whispered to lazarev who did not know where to go lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks 
 napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another and a page the same one rostov had seen the previous evening at boris ran forward and bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in it an order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them then he approached lazarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally and the small white hand holding the order touched one of buttons it was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid the cross on breast and dropping his hand turned toward alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there and it really did 
 officious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing motionless presenting arms looked again straight into eyes as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do something else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigid position 
 the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhensk battalion breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them 
 lazarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by rostov 
 what think of the treat all on silver plate one of them was saying have you seen lazarev 
 i have 
 tomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner 
 yes but what luck for lazarev twelve hundred francs pension for life 
 a cap lads shouted a preobrazhensk soldier donning a shaggy french cap 
 a fine thing 
 have you heard the password asked one guards officer of another the day before yesterday it was napoleon france bravoure yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he must respond in kind 
 boris too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhensk banquet on his way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house 
 rostov how do we missed one another he said and could not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and troubled was face 
 nothing nothing replied rostov 
 call round 
 yes i will 
 rostov stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a distance a distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he remembered denisov with his changed expression his submission and the whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperor liked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he thought of lazarev rewarded and denisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened 
 the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning there he found so many people among them officers who like himself had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostov began shouting with wrath and therefore much to the surprise of the officers 
 how can you judge best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to his face how can you judge the actions what right have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the or his actions 
 but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer justifying himself and unable to understand outburst except on the supposition that he was drunk 
 but rostov did not listen to him 
 we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he went on if we are ordered to die we must die if punished it means that we have deserved it not for us to judge if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left that way we shall be saying there is no god nothing shouted nicholas banging the table very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts 
 our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think all said he 
 and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel 
 yes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another bottle he shouted 
 in the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting

 master gorbeau 
 forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared 
 it was no longer solitude for there were it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty 
 what was it then

 the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters 
 post no daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness 
 nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen 
 this hovel was only one story high 
 the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion 
 the door was nothing but a collection of planks roughly bound together by which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls 
 the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one 
 above the door it said number the inside replied no number 
 no one knows what figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening 
 the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and unpasted threatened rather than screened the occupants 
 the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter 
 this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman 
 the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house 
 this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood 
 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence 
 this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind 
 it was the road to bicetre 
 it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death paris on the day of their execution 
 it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled 
 take a few steps and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe where ulbach stabbed the of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur nor to uphold it with authority 
 leaving aside this place which was as it were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even is so unattractive where stood the building number 
 bourgeois houses only began to spring up there years later the place was unpleasant 
 in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the salpetriere a glimpse of whose dome could be seen and bicetre whose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men 
 as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood hovels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cerecloths new white walls like everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings erected on a line flat constructions long cold rows and the melancholy sadness of right angles 
 not an unevenness of the ground not a caprice in the architecture not a fold the ensemble was glacial regular hideous 
 nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry 
 it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief 
 despair yawns something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored 
 if such a hell existed that bit of the boulevard de might have formed the entrance to it 
 nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful 
 the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite the cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it 
 one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly in the evening melancholy by night it was sinister 
 in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain these good old women were fond of begging 
 however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation 
 even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of germs trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire the old houses crumble and new ones rise 
 since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets 
 the symptoms of a new life are evident in this old provincial quarter in the wildest nooks the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians 
 one memorable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de and that paris had entered the suburb of

 prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in bogucharovo cloister as his father called prince estate despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himself who never left the country in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs

 how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile 
 what 
 pleasant your excellency 
 what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring i suppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything is green already how early the birches and cherry and alders too are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak 
 at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine 
 spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at those cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies

 a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything anew but that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not disturbing himself or desiring anything

 book gorbeau hovel 
 chapter iii 
 
 two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune 
 on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake 
 some new thing had come into his soul 
 jean valjean had never loved anything for years he had been alone in the world 
 he had never been father lover husband friend in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy 
 the heart of that was full of virginity his sister and his children had left him only a vague and memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them 
 human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss 
 when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him 
 all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child 
 he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy 
 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing 
 poor old man with a perfectly new heart 
 only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light 
 it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise 
 the early days passed in this dazzled state 
 cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing 
 she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her 
 like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded 
 all had repulsed her the thenardiers their children other children 
 she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her 
 it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility 
 thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man 
 she felt that which she had never felt sensation of expansion 
 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty 
 these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy 
 the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here 
 nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our past a delightful garret 
 nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed the other 
 instinct sought a father as jean instinct sought a child 
 to meet was to find each other 
 at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together 
 when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely 
 taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become father after a celestial fashion 
 and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god 
 moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well 
 there he seemed perfectly secure 
 the chamber with a which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard 
 this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side 
 the of number a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a for and no communication existed between it and the first story 
 it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were 
 the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited 
 it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve 
 he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival 
 week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel 
 cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak 
 children have their morning song as well as birds 
 it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it 
 the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion 
 at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning 
 she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life 
 jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read 
 sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison 
 this idea had ended in teaching a child to read 
 then the smiled with the pensive smile of the angels 
 he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who was not man and he became absorbed in revery 
 good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones 
 to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean existence 
 and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray 
 she called him father and knew no other name for him 
 he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle 
 life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light

 two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune 
 on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake 
 some new thing had come into his soul 
 jean valjean had never loved anything for years he had been alone in the world 
 he had never been father lover husband friend in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy 
 the heart of that was full of virginity his sister and his children had left him only a vague and memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them 
 human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss 
 when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him 
 all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child 
 he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy 
 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing 
 poor old man with a perfectly new heart 
 only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light 
 it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise 
 the early days passed in this dazzled state 
 cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing 
 she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her 
 like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded 
 all had repulsed her the thenardiers their children other children 
 she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her 
 it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility 
 thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man 
 she felt that which she had never felt sensation of expansion 
 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty 
 these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy 
 the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here 
 nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our past a delightful garret 
 nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed the other 
 instinct sought a father as jean instinct sought a child 
 to meet was to find each other 
 at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together 
 when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely 
 taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become father after a celestial fashion 
 and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god 
 moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well 
 there he seemed perfectly secure 
 the chamber with a which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard 
 this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side 
 the of number a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a for and no communication existed between it and the first story 
 it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were 
 the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited 
 it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve 
 he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival 
 week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel 
 cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak 
 children have their morning song as well as birds 
 it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it 
 the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion 
 at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning 
 she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life 
 jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read 
 sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison 
 this idea had ended in teaching a child to read 
 then the smiled with the pensive smile of the angels 
 he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who was not man and he became absorbed in revery 
 good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones 
 to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean existence 
 and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray 
 she called him father and knew no other name for him 
 he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle 
 life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light 
 the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts 
 at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly 
 this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in javert

 prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him 
 it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe 
 prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him 
 suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity 
 in count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying the night 
 during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is she thinking about why is she so glad 
 that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the stupid old man as he called rostov who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having stayed 
 he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky 
 his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also awake he heard female voices overhead 
 just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew recognized at once 
 but when are you coming to bed replied another voice 
 i i sleep the use come now for the last time 
 two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song 
 oh how lovely now go to sleep and an end of it 
 you go to sleep but i said the first voice coming nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence 
 sonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up sonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never was such a lovely night before 
 sonya made some reluctant reply 
 do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight as tight as possible and flying away like this 
 take care fall out 
 he heard the sound of a scuffle and disapproving voice past one 
 oh you only spoil things for me all right go go 
 again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh 
 o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed then if it must be and she slammed the casement 
 for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him there she is again as if it were on purpose thought he 
 in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once

 the remarks of the principal tenant 
 jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at nightfall he liked to go to which is the nearest church when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the delight was to go out with the good man 
 she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous with catherine he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her 
 it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person 
 the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market 
 they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances 
 jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to replaced by a solid door 
 he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat in the street he was taken for a poor man 
 it sometimes happened that women turned back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow 
 it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver coin and walked rapidly away this had its disadvantages 
 he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms 
 the old principal lodger a creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact 
 she was a little deaf which rendered her talkative 
 there remained to her from her past two above the other she was continually knocking against each other 
 she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from montfermeil 
 one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him 
 jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt 
 the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a for a thousand francs 
 it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence 
 she fled in alarm 
 a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this bill changed for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before where thought the old woman 
 he did not go out until six in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour 
 the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises 
 that note commented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes 
 a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his in the corridor 
 the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order 
 she was alone 
 cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed 
 the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail and examined it 
 the lining had been sewed up again 
 the good woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper more no doubt 
 she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big a very large knife suspicious circumstance several wigs of various colors 
 each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents 
 thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter

 next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home 
 it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots 
 the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away 
 yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the left side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of sappy foliage stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now through the hard bark even where there were no twigs leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced 
 yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens his dead reproachful face pierre at the ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind 
 no life is not over at prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in me everyone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony 
 on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to the service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical 
 my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas go out today very cold 
 if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him 
 at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries men up

 on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to the service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical 
 my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas go out today very cold 
 if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him 
 at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries men up

 of love 
 the stage is more beholding to love than the life of man for as to the stage love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies but in life it doth much mischief sometimes like a siren sometimes like a fury you may observe that amongst all the great and worthy persons whereof the memory remaineth either ancient or recent there is not one that hath been transported to the mad degree of love which shows that great spirits and great business do keep out this weak passion 
 you must except nevertheless marcus antonius the half partner of the empire of rome and appius claudius the decemvir and lawgiver whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man and inordinate but the latter was an austere and wise man and therefore it seems though rarely that love can find entrance not only into an open heart but also into a heart well fortified if watch be not well kept it is a poor saying of epicurus satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus as if man made for the contemplation of heaven and all noble objects should do nothing but kneel before a little idol and make himself subject though not of the mouth as beasts are yet of the eye which was given him for higher purposes it is a strange thing to note the excess of this passion and how it braves the nature and value of things by this that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love neither is it merely in the phrase for whereas it hath been well said that the with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence is a self certainly the lover is more for there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself as the lover doth of me person loved and therefore it was well said mat it is impossible to love and to be wise neither doth his weakness appear to others only and not to the party loved but to the loved most of all except the love be reciproque 
 
 for it is a true rule that love is ever rewarded either with the reciproque or 
 with an inward and secret contempt by how much the more men ought to beware of this passion which loseth not only other things but itself as for the other losses the relation doth well figure them that he that preferred helena quitted the gifts of juno and pallas for whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection quitteth both riches and wisdom this passion hath his floods in the very times of weakness which are great prosperity and great adversity though this latter hath been less observed both which times kindle love and make it more fervent and therefore show it to be the child of folly they do best who if they cannot but admit love yet make it keep quarter 
 and sever it wholly from their serious affairs and actions of life for if it check 
 once with business it troubleth men s fortunes and maketh men that they can no ways be true to their own ends i know not how but martial men are given to love i think it is but as they are given to wine for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures there is in nature a secret inclination and motion towards love of others which if it be not spent upon some one or a few doth naturally spread itself towards many and maketh men become humane and charitable as it is seen sometime in friars nuptial love maketh mankind friendly love perfecteth it but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it

 book just man 
 chapter ix 
 
 the brother as depicted by the sister 
 in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instincts even which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron the friend of her childhood 
 this letter is in our possession 
 d dec my good madam 
 not a day passes without our speaking of you it is our established custom but there is another reason besides just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours 
 madam magloire has pulled off all the paper there were things beneath 
 my which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams as in yours this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers 
 but my room is the one you ought to see 
 madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable 
 the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me 
 in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night 
 what shall i say to you 
 i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum 
 she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden of ancient fashion they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany 
 i am always very happy 
 my brother is so good 
 he gives all he has to the poor and sick 
 we are very much cramped 
 the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need 
 we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed you see that these are great treats 
 my brother has ways of his own 
 when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so 
 just imagine the door of our house is never fastened whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my room he fears nothing even at night 
 that is his sort of bravery he says 
 he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him he exposes himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it 
 one must know how to understand him 
 he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter he fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters nor night 
 last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers 
 he would not take us 
 he was absent for a fortnight 
 on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and said this is the way i have been robbed 
 and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him 
 when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me 
 at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible 
 now i have ended by getting used to it i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him he risks himself as he sees fit 
 i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep 
 i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me 
 i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop 
 it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences 
 but now the habit has been acquired 
 we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep 
 if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so 
 after all what is there for us to fear in this house 
 there is always some one with us who is stronger than we 
 the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here 
 this suffices me 
 my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me 
 i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence 
 that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul 
 i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family 
 you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist 
 they really are a very ancient norman family of the generalship of caen 
 five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux a jean de faux and a thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort the last was and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne 
 his daughter married de gramont son of the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards and of the army 
 it is written faux fauq and faoucq 
 good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal 
 as for your dear sylvanie she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me 
 she is well works as you would wish and loves me 
 that is all that i desire 
 the souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy 
 my health is not so very bad and yet i grow thinner every day 
 farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you 
 a thousand good wishes

 book just man 
 chapter ix 
 
 the brother as depicted by the sister 
 in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instincts even which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron the friend of her childhood 
 this letter is in our possession 
 d dec my good madam 
 not a day passes without our speaking of you it is our established custom but there is another reason besides just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours 
 madam magloire has pulled off all the paper there were things beneath 
 my which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams as in yours this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers 
 but my room is the one you ought to see 
 madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable 
 the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me 
 in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night 
 what shall i say to you 
 i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum

 a new hope 
 ix 
 
 as they traveled father and deeper into the bowels of the gigantic station they foundit increasingly difficult to maintain an air of casual indifference fortunately thosewho might have sensed some nervousness on the part of the two armored trooperswould regard it as only natural considering their huge dangerous wookie also made it impossible for the two young men to be as inconspicuous asthey would have liked 
 the farther they traveled the heavier the traffic became other technicians and mechanicals bustled around them intent on their ownassignments they ignored the trio completely only a few of the humans sparing thewookie a curious glance morose expression and the seemingconfidence of his captors reassured the inquisitive 
 eventually they reached a wide bank of elevators luke breathed a sigh ofrelief the transport ought to be capable of taking them justabout anywhere on the station in response to a verbal command 
 there was a nervous second when a minor official raced to get aboard sologestured sharply and the other without voicing a protest shifted to the next elevatortube in line 
 luke studied the operating panel then tried to sound at once knowledgeable andimportant as he spoke into the pickup grid instead he sounded nervous and the elevator was a mechanism not programmed to differentiate theappropriateness of emotions conveyed vocally so the door slid shut and they wereon their way after what felt like hours but was in reality only minutes the dooropened and they stepped out into the security area 
 it had been hope they would discover something like the cells of the kind used on tatooine in towns like mos eisley instead they sawonly narrow ramps bordering a bottomless ventilation shaft these levels of them ran parallel to smooth curving walls which held facelessdetention cells guards and energy gates seemed to be everywherethey looked 
 uncomfortably aware that the longer they stood frozen in place the soonersomeone was bound to come over and ask unanswerable questions luke searchedfrantically for a course of action 
 this going to work solo whispered leaning toward him 
 why you say so before a frustrated frightened luke shot back 
 i think i did i 
 shssh 
 solo shuts up worst fears were realized a tall officerapproached them he frowned as he examined the silent chewbacca 
 where are you two going with 
 chewbacca snarled at the remark and solo quieted him with a hasty jab in theribs a panicky luke found himself replying almost instinctively prisonertransfer from block ts 
 the officer looked puzzled i notified have to clear it 
 turning the man walked to a small console nearby and began entering hisrequest luke and han hurriedly surveyed the situation their gaze traveling fromalarms energy gates and remote photosensors to the three other guards station in thearea 
 solo nodded to luke as he unfastened cuffs then he whisperedsomething to the wookie an howl shook the corridor as chewbaccathrew up both hands grabbing rifle from him 
 look out a seemingly terrified solo shouted loose rip us allapart 
 both he and luke had darted clear of the rampaging wookie pulled out theirpistols and were blasting away at him their reaction was excellent theirenthusiasm undeniable and their aim execrable not a single shot came close to thedodging wookie instead they blasted automatic cameras controls andthe three dumbfounded guards 
 at this point it occurred to the officer in charge that the abominable aim of thetwo soldiers was a bit too selectively efficient he was preparing to jab the generalalarm when a burst from pistol caught him in the midsection and he fellwithout a word to the gray deck 
 solo rushed to the open comlink speaker which was screeching anxiousquestions about what was going on apparently there were audio as well as visuallinks between this detention station and elsewhere 
 ignoring the barrage of alternate threats and queries he checked the readout setin the panel nearby got to find out which cell this princess of yours is must a dozen levels it is cell go and them here 
 luke nodded once and was racing down the narrow walkway 
 after gesturing for the wookie to take up a position where he could cover theelevators solo took a deep breath and responded to the unceasing calls from thecomlink 
 under control he said into the pickup sounding reasonablyofficial situation normal 
 it sound like that a voice snapped back in a tone whathappened 
 uh well one of the guards experienced a weapon malfunction solostammered his temporary officialese lapsing into nervousness no problem all fine thanks how about you 
 sending a squad up the voice announced suddenly 
 han could almost smell the suspicion at the other end what to say hespoke more eloquently with the business end of a pistol 
 we have an energy dangerous 
 weapon malfunction energy leakwho is this your operating 
 pointing his pistol at the panels solo blew the instrumentation to silent was a dumb conversation anyway he murmured turning he shouted down thecorridor hurry it up luke going to have company 
 luke heard but he was absorbed in running from one cell to the next andstudying the numbers glowing above each doorway the cell it appeared didnot exist but it did and he found it just as he was about to give up and try the nextlevel down 
 for a long moment he examined the featureless convex metal wall turning hispistol to maximum and hoping it melt in his hand before it broke through heopened fire on the door when the weapon became too hot to hold he tossed it fromhand to hand as he did so the smoke had time to clear and he saw with somesurprise that the door had been blown away 
 peering through the smoke with an uncomprehending look on her face was theyoung woman whose portrait artoo detoo had projected in a garage on tatooineseveral centuries ago or it seemed 
 she was even more beautiful than her image luke decided staring dazedly ather i 
 her look of confusion and uncertainty was replaced by first puzzlement and thenimpatience you a littler short for a storm trooper she finally commented 
 what uniform he removed the helmet regaining a littlecomposure at the same time come to rescue you luke skywalker 
 i beg your pardon she said politely 
 i said come to rescue you ben kenobi is with me got yourtwo droids 
 the uncertainty was instantly replaced by hope at the mention of the ben kenobi she looked around luke ignoring him as she searched forthe jedi where is he 
 governor tarkin watched as darth vader paced rapidly back and forth in theotherwise empty conference room finally the dark lord paused glancing aroundas though a great bell only he could hear had rung somewhere close by 
 he is here vader stated unemotionally 
 tarkin looked startled kenobi impossible what makesyou think so 
 a stirring in the force of a kind felt only in the presence of my old is unmistakable 
 he must be dead by now 
 vader hesitated his assurance suddenly gone perhapsit is gone now itwas only a brief sensation 
 the jedi are extinct declared tarkin positively their fire was quencheddecades ago you my friend are all left of their ways 
 a comlink buzzed softly for attention yes tarkin acknowledged 
 we have an emergency alert in detention block aa 
 the princess tarkin yelped jumping to his feet vader whirled trying tostare through the walls 
 i know is here i knew i could not mistake a stirring in the forceof such power 
 put all sections on alert tarkin ordered through the comlink then he turnedto stare at vader if right he must not be allowed to escape 
 escape may not be intention vader replied struggling tocontrol his emotions he is the last of the the greatest the danger hepresents to us must not be only i can deal with him his headsnapped around to stare fixedly at tarkin alone 
 luke and leia had started back up the corridor when a series of blindingexplosion ripped the walkway ahead of them several troopers had tried comingthrough the elevator only to be crisped one after another by chewbacca disdainingthe elevators they had blasted a gaping hole through a wall the opening was toolarge for solo and the wookie to cover completely in twos and threes the imperialswere working their way into the detention block 
 retreating down the walkway han and chewbacca encountered luke and theprincess we go back that way solo told them his face flushed withexcitement and worry 
 no it looks like managed to cut off our only escape route leia agreedreadily this is a detention area you know they build them with multipleexits 
 breathing heavily solo turned to look her up and down begging yourforgiveness your highness he said sarcastically but maybe prefer it back inyour cell she looked away her face impassive 
 got to be another way out luke muttered pulling a small transmitterunit from his belt and carefully adjusting the frequency see threepioseethreepio 
 a familiar voice responded with gratifying speed yes sir 
 been cut off here are there any other ways out of the detention at all 
 static crackled over the tiny grid as solo and chewbacca kept the imperial troopsbottled up at the other end of the walkway 
 what was that i copy 
 back in the gentry office artoo detoo beeped and whistled frantically asthreepio adjusted controls fighting to clear the awkward transmission i said allsystems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entry seems to be the onlyway in or out of the cell block he pressed instruments and the view on the nearbyreadouts changed steadily all other information on your section is restricted 
 someone began banging on the locked door to the at first andthen when no response was forthcoming from within more insistently 
 oh no threepio groaned 
 the smoke in the cell corridor was now so intense that it was difficult for soloand chewbacca to pick their targets that was fortunate inasmuch as they were nowbadly outnumbered and the smoke confused the imperials fire with equalthoroughness 
 every so often one of the soldiers would attempt to move closer only to standexposed as he penetrated the smoke under the accurate fire of the two would rapidly join the accumulating mass of motionless figures on the rampwayflooring 
 energy bolts continued to ricochet wildly through the block as luke moved closeto solo 
 there other way out he yelled over the deafening roar of concentratedfire 
 well closing in on us what do we do now 
 this is some rescue an irritated voice complained from behind them bothmen turned to see a thoroughly disgusted princess eyeing them with regal you came in here you have a plan of getting out 
 solo nodded toward luke the brains sweetheart 
 luke managed an embarrassed grin and shrugged helplessly he turned to helpreturn fire but before he could do so the princess had snatched the pistol from hishand 
 hey 
 luke stared as she moved along the wall finally locating a small grate pointed the pistol at it and fired 
 solo gazed at her in disbelief what do you think doing 
 it looks like up to me to save our skins get into the garbage 
 while the others looked on in amazement she jumped feet first into the openingand disappeared chewbacca rumbled threateningly but solo slowly shook his head 
 no chewie i want you to rip her apart not sure about her beginning to like her or going to kill her myself the wookiesnorted something else and solo yelled back at him go on in you furry oaf care what you smell this is no time to go dainty on me 
 shoving the reluctant wookie toward the tiny opening solo helped jam themassive bulk through as soon as he disappeared the corellian followed him fired off the last series of blasts more in the hope of creating a covering smokethan hitting anything slid into the chute and was gone 
 not wanting to incur further losses in such a confined space the pursuingsoldiers had momentarily halted to await the arrival of reinforcements and heavierweapons besides they had their quarry trapped and despite their dedication noneof them were anxious to die needlessly 
 the chamber luke tumbled into was dimly lit not that the light was needed todiscern its contents he smelled the decay long before he was dumped into except for the concealed illuminants the garbage room was at least aquarter full of slimy muck much of which had already achieved a state ofdecomposition sufficient to wrinkle nose 
 solo was stumbling around the edge of the room slipping and sinking up to hisknees in the uncertain footing in an attempt to locate an exit al he found was asmall thick hatchway which he grunted and heaved to pry open the hatchcoverrefused to budge 
 the garbage chute was a wonderful idea he told the princess the sweat from his forehead what an incredible smell we ride out here on a drifting odor and there seem to beany other exit unless i can get this hatch open 
 stepping back he pulled his pistol and fired at the cover the bolt promptlywent howling around the room as everyone sought cover in the garbage a lastglance and the bolt detonated almost on top of them 
 looking less dignified by the moment leia was the first to emerge from thepungent cover put that thing away she told solo grimly or going to getus all killed 
 yes your worship solo muttered in snide supplication he made no moveto reholster his weapon as he glanced back up toward the open chute above take long for them to figure out what happened to us we had things wellunder you led us down here 
 sure you did she shot back brushing refuse from her hair and well it could be worse 
 as if in reply a piercing horrible moaning filled the room it seemed to comefrom somewhere beneath them chewbacca let out a terrified yowl of his own andtried to flatten himself against a wall luke drew his own pistol and peered hard atvarious clumps of debris but saw nothing 
 what was that solo asked 
 not too sure luke suddenly jumped looking down and behind just moved past me i think watch out 
 with shocking suddenness luke disappeared straight down into the garbage 
 got luke the princess shouted it took him under solo lookedaround frantically for something to shoot at 
 as abruptly as he had vanished luke so did part of somethingelse a thick whitish tentacle was wrapped tight around his throat 
 shoot it kill it luke screamed 
 shoot it i even see it solo protested 
 once again luke was sucked under by whatever that gruesome appendage wasattached to solo stared helplessly around the multicolored surface 
 there was a distant rumble of heavy machinery and two opposing walls of thechamber moved inward several centimeters the rumble ceased and then it wasquiet again luke appeared unexpectedly close to solo scrabbling his way clear ofthe suffocating mess and rubbing at the welt on his neck 
 what happened to it leia wondered eyeing the quiescent garbage warily 
 luke looked genuinely puzzled i know it had then i wasfree it just let me go and disappeared maybe i smell bad enough for it 
 got a very bad feeling about this solo murmured 
 again the distant rumble filled the room again the walls began their inwardmarch only this time neither sound nor movement showed any sign of stopping 
 just stand there gaping at each other the princess urged them try tobrace them with something 
 even with the thick poles and old metal beams chewbacca could handle theywere unable to find anything capable of slowing the walls advance it seemed as ifthe stronger the object was that they placed against the walls the easier it wassnapped luke pulled out his comlink simultaneously trying to talk and will thewalls to retreat threepiocome in threepio a decent paused produced noresponse causing luke to look worriedly at his companions 
 i know why he answer he tried again see threepio comein do you read

 are you there sir the droid replied had some minor would not believe

 a new hope 
 ix 
 
 as they traveled father and deeper into the bowels of the gigantic station they foundit increasingly difficult to maintain an air of casual indifference fortunately thosewho might have sensed some nervousness on the part of the two armored trooperswould regard it as only natural considering their huge dangerous wookie also made it impossible for the two young men to be as inconspicuous asthey would have liked 
 the farther they traveled the heavier the traffic became other technicians and mechanicals bustled around them intent on their ownassignments they ignored the trio completely only a few of the humans sparing thewookie a curious glance morose expression and the seemingconfidence of his captors reassured the inquisitive 
 eventually they reached a wide bank of elevators luke breathed a sigh ofrelief the transport ought to be capable of taking them justabout anywhere on the station in response to a verbal command 
 there was a nervous second when a minor official raced to get aboard sologestured sharply and the other without voicing a protest shifted to the next elevatortube in line 
 luke studied the operating panel then tried to sound at once knowledgeable andimportant as he spoke into the pickup grid instead he sounded nervous and the elevator was a mechanism not programmed to differentiate theappropriateness of emotions conveyed vocally so the door slid shut and they wereon their way after what felt like hours but was in reality only minutes the dooropened and they stepped out into the security area 
 it had been hope they would discover something like the cells of the kind used on tatooine in towns like mos eisley instead they sawonly narrow ramps bordering a bottomless ventilation shaft these levels of them ran parallel to smooth curving walls which held facelessdetention cells guards and energy gates seemed to be everywherethey looked 
 uncomfortably aware that the longer they stood frozen in place the soonersomeone was bound to come over and ask unanswerable questions luke searchedfrantically for a course of action 
 this going to work solo whispered leaning toward him 
 why you say so before a frustrated frightened luke shot back 
 i think i did i 
 shssh 
 solo shuts up worst fears were realized a tall officerapproached them he frowned as he examined the silent chewbacca 
 where are you two going with 
 chewbacca snarled at the remark and solo quieted him with a hasty jab in theribs a panicky luke found himself replying almost instinctively prisonertransfer from block ts 
 the officer looked puzzled i notified have to clear it 
 turning the man walked to a small console nearby and began entering hisrequest luke and han hurriedly surveyed the situation their gaze traveling fromalarms energy gates and remote photosensors to the three other guards station in thearea 
 solo nodded to luke as he unfastened cuffs then he whisperedsomething to the wookie an howl shook the corridor as chewbaccathrew up both hands grabbing rifle from him 
 look out a seemingly terrified solo shouted loose rip us allapart 
 both he and luke had darted clear of the rampaging wookie pulled out theirpistols and were blasting away at him their reaction was excellent theirenthusiasm undeniable and their aim execrable not a single shot came close to thedodging wookie instead they blasted automatic cameras controls andthe three dumbfounded guards 
 at this point it occurred to the officer in charge that the abominable aim of thetwo soldiers was a bit too selectively efficient he was preparing to jab the generalalarm when a burst from pistol caught him in the midsection and he fellwithout a word to the gray deck 
 solo rushed to the open comlink speaker which was screeching anxiousquestions about what was going on apparently there were audio as well as visuallinks between this detention station and elsewhere 
 ignoring the barrage of alternate threats and queries he checked the readout setin the panel nearby got to find out which cell this princess of yours is must a dozen levels it is cell go and them here 
 luke nodded once and was racing down the narrow walkway 
 after gesturing for the wookie to take up a position where he could cover theelevators solo took a deep breath and responded to the unceasing calls from thecomlink 
 under control he said into the pickup sounding reasonablyofficial situation normal 
 it sound like that a voice snapped back in a tone whathappened 
 uh well one of the guards experienced a weapon malfunction solostammered his temporary officialese lapsing into nervousness no problem all fine thanks how about you 
 sending a squad up the voice announced suddenly 
 han could almost smell the suspicion at the other end what to say hespoke more eloquently with the business end of a pistol 
 we have an energy dangerous 
 weapon malfunction energy leakwho is this your operating 
 pointing his pistol at the panels solo blew the instrumentation to silent was a dumb conversation anyway he murmured turning he shouted down thecorridor hurry it up luke going to have company 
 luke heard but he was absorbed in running from one cell to the next andstudying the numbers glowing above each doorway the cell it appeared didnot exist but it did and he found it just as he was about to give up and try the nextlevel down 
 for a long moment he examined the featureless convex metal wall turning hispistol to maximum and hoping it melt in his hand before it broke through heopened fire on the door when the weapon became too hot to hold he tossed it fromhand to hand as he did so the smoke had time to clear and he saw with somesurprise that the door had been blown away 
 peering through the smoke with an uncomprehending look on her face was theyoung woman whose portrait artoo detoo had projected in a garage on tatooineseveral centuries ago or it seemed 
 she was even more beautiful than her image luke decided staring dazedly ather i 
 her look of confusion and uncertainty was replaced by first puzzlement and thenimpatience you a littler short for a storm trooper she finally commented 
 what uniform he removed the helmet regaining a littlecomposure at the same time come to rescue you luke skywalker 
 i beg your pardon she said politely 
 i said come to rescue you ben kenobi is with me got yourtwo droids 
 the uncertainty was instantly replaced by hope at the mention of the ben kenobi she looked around luke ignoring him as she searched forthe jedi where is he 
 governor tarkin watched as darth vader paced rapidly back and forth in theotherwise empty conference room finally the dark lord paused glancing aroundas though a great bell only he could hear had rung somewhere close by 
 he is here vader stated unemotionally 
 tarkin looked startled kenobi impossible what makesyou think so 
 a stirring in the force of a kind felt only in the presence of my old is unmistakable 
 he must be dead by now 
 vader hesitated his assurance suddenly gone perhapsit is gone now itwas only a brief sensation 
 the jedi are extinct declared tarkin positively their fire was quencheddecades ago you my friend are all left of their ways
