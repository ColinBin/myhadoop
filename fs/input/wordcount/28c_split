lionfish nov chapter the madness of mr crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ron and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast on sunday to send a letter to percy asking as sirius had suggested whether he had seen mr crouch lately they used hedwig because it had been so long since had a job when they had watched her fly out of sight through the owlery window they proceeded down to the kitchen to give dobby his new socks 
 
 the gave them a very cheery welcome bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again dobby was ecstatic about his present 
 
 harry potter is too good to dobby he squeaked wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes 
 
 you saved my life with that gillyweed dobby you really did said harry 
 
 no chance of more of those eclairs is there said ron who was looking around at the beaming and bowing 
 
 just had breakfast said hermione irritably but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them supported by four elves 
 
 we should get some stuff to send up to snuffles harry muttered 
 
 good idea said ron give pig something to do you give us a bit of extra food could you he said to the surrounding elves and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more 
 
 dobby winky said hermione who was looking around 
 
 winky is over there by the fire miss said dobby quietly his ears drooping slightly 
 
 oh dear said hermione as she spotted winky 
 
 harry looked over at the fireplace too winky was sitting on the same stool as last time but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the brick behind her her clothes were ragged and unwashed she was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool staring into the fire as they watched her she gave an enormous hiccup 
 
 winky is getting through six bottles a day now dobby whispered to harry 
 
 well not strong that stuff harry said 
 
 but dobby shook his head tis strong for a sir he said 
 
 winky hiccuped again the elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work 
 
 winky is pining harry potter dobby whispered sadly winky wants to go home winky still thinks mr crouch is her master sir and nothing dobby says will persuade her that professor dumbledore is her master now 
 
 hey winky said harry struck by a sudden inspiration walking over to her and bending down you know what mr crouch might be up to do you because stopped turning up to judge the triwizard tournament 
 
 eyes flickered her enormous pupils focused on harry she swayed slightly again and then said m master is stopped hic coming 
 
 yeah said harry we seen him since the first task the daily saying ill 
 
 winky swayed some more staring blurrily at harry 
 
 master hic ill 
 
 her bottom lip began to tremble 
 
 but not sure if true said hermione quickly 
 
 master is needing his hic winky whimpered the elf master cannot hic manage hic all by himself 
 
 other people manage to do their own housework you know winky hermione said severely 
 
 winky hic is not only hic doing housework for mr crouch winky squeaked indignantly swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse master is hic trusting winky with hic the most important hic the most secret 
 
 what said harry 
 
 but winky shook her head very hard spilling more butterbeer down herself 
 
 winky keeps hic her secrets she said mutinously swaying very heavily now frowning up at harry with her eyes crossed you is hic nosing you is 
 
 winky must not talk like that to harry potter said dobby angrily harry potter is brave and noble and harry potter is not nosy 
 
 he is nosing hic into my hic private and secret hic winky is a good hic winky keeps her silence hic people trying to hic pry and poke hic 
 
 eyelids drooped and suddenly without warning she slid off her stool into the hearth snoring loudly the empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the floor half a dozen came hurrying forward looking disgusted one of them picked up the bottle the others covered winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly hiding her from view 
 
 we is sorry you had to see that sirs and miss squeaked a nearby elf shaking his head and looking very ashamed we is hoping you will not judge us all by winky sirs and miss 
 
 unhappy said hermione exasperated why you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up 
 
 begging your pardon miss said the bowing deeply again but has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served 
 
 oh for heavens sake hermione cried listen to me all of you got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes you have to do everything told look at dobby 
 
 miss will please keep dobby out of this dobby mumbled looking scared the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the around the kitchen they were suddenly looking at hermione as though she were mad and dangerous 
 
 we has your extra food squeaked an elf at elbow and he shoved a large ham a dozen cakes and some fruit into arms 
 
 the crowded around harry ron and hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs 
 
 thank you for the socks harry potter dobby called miserably from the hearth where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was winky 
 
 you keep your mouth shut could you hermione said ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them they want us visiting them now we tried to get more stuff out of winky about crouch 
 
 oh as if you care about that scoffed hermione you only like coming down here for the food 
 
 it was an irritable sort of day after that harry got so tired of ron and hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took food up to the owlery that evening on his own 
 
 pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself so harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well when they had set off into the dusk looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them harry leaned on the windowsill looking out at the grounds at the dark rustling treetops of the forbidden forest and the rippling sails of the durmstrang ship an eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from chimney it soared toward the castle around the owlery and out of sight looking down harry saw hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin harry wondered what he was doing it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch as he watched madame maxime emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to hagrid she appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation hagrid leaned upon his spade but did not seem keen to prolong their talk because madame maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward 
 
 unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen to ron and hermione snarling at each other harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around harry began to awake swooshing past him into the night 
 
 
 
 by breakfast the next day and bad moods had burnt out and to relief dark predictions that the would send substandard food up to the gryffindor table because hermione had insulted them proved false the bacon eggs and kippers were quite as good as usual 
 
 when the post owls arrived hermione looked up eagerly she seemed to be expecting something 
 
 percy had time to answer yet said ron we only sent hedwig yesterday 
 
 no not that said hermione taken out a subscription to the daily prophet getting sick of finding everything out from the slytherins 
 
 good thinking said harry also looking up at the owls hey hermione i think in luck 
 
 a gray owl was soaring down toward hermione 
 
 it got a newspaper though she said looking disappointed 
 
 but to her bewilderment the gray owl landed in front of her plate closely followed by four barn owls a brown owl and a tawny 
 
 how many subscriptions did you take out said harry seizing goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls all of whom were jostling close to her trying to deliver their own letter first 
 
 what on earth hermione said taking the letter from the gray owl opening it and starting to read oh really she sputtered going rather red 
 
 up said ron 
 
 oh how ridiculous 
 
 she thrust the letter at harry who saw that it was not handwritten but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the daily prophet 
 
 you are a wicked girl harry potter deserves 
 better go back where you came from muggle 
 all like it said hermione desperately opening one letter after another harry potter can do much better than the likes of you you deserve to be boiled in frog spawn ouch 
 
 she had opened the last envelope and liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands which began to erupt in large yellow boils 
 
 undiluted bubotuber pus said ron picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it 
 
 ow said hermione tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick knobbly gloves 
 
 better get up to the hospital wing said harry as the owls around hermione took flight tell professor sprout where gone 
 
 i warned her said ron as hermione hurried out of the great hall cradling her hands i warned her not to annoy rita skeeter look at this one he read out one of the letters hermione had left behind i read in witch weekly about how you are playing harry potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as i can find a big enough envelope blimey better watch out for herself 
 
 hermione turn up for herbology as harry and ron left the greenhouse for their care of magical creatures class they saw malfoy crabbe and goyle descending the stone steps of the castle pansy parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of slytherin girls catching sight of harry pansy called potter have you split up with your girlfriend why was she so upset at breakfast 
 
 harry ignored her he want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the witch weekly article had caused 
 
 hagrid who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet heart sank at the sight of the crates surely not another skrewt hatching but when he got near enough to see inside he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts their front paws were curiously flat like spades and they were blinking up at the class looking politely puzzled at all the attention 
 
 nifflers said hagrid when the class had gathered around yeh find em down mines mostly they like sparkly yeh go look 
 
 one of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite pansy watch off her wrist she shrieked and jumped backward 
 
 useful little treasure detectors said hagrid happily thought have some fun with em today see over there he pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth harry had watched him digging from the owlery window buried some gold coins got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most jus take off all yer valuables an choose a niffler an get ready ter set em loose 
 
 harry took off his watch which he was only wearing out of habit as it work anymore and stuffed it into his pocket then he picked up a niffler it put its long snout in ear and sniffed enthusiastically it was really quite cuddly 
 
 hang on said hagrid looking down into the crate a spare niffler missin hermione 
 
 she had to go to the hospital wing said ron 
 
 explain later harry muttered pansy parkinson was listening 
 
 it was easily the most fun they had ever had in care of magical creatures the nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands was particularly efficient it had soon filled his lap with coins 
 
 can you buy these as pets hagrid he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil splattering his robes 
 
 yer mum wouldn be happy ron said hagrid grinning they wreck houses nifflers i reckon nearly got the lot now he added pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive i buried a hundred coins oh there hermione 
 
 hermione was walking toward them across the lawn her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable pansy parkinson was watching her beadily 
 
 well check how done said hagrid count yer coins an no point tryin ter steal any goyle he added his eyes narrowed leprechaun gold vanishes after a few hours 
 
 goyle emptied his pockets looking extremely sulky it turned out that niffler had been most successful so hagrid gave him an enormous slab of chocolate for a prize the bell rang across the grounds for lunch the rest of the class set off back to the castle but harry ron and hermione stayed behind to help hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes harry noticed madame maxime watching them out other carriage window 
 
 what yeh done ter your hands hermione said hagrid looking concerned 
 
 hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning and the envelope full of bubotuber pus 
 
 aaah don worry said hagrid gently looking down at her i got some o those letters an all after rita skeeter wrote abou me mum a monster an yeh should be put down yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lake 
 
 no said hermione looking shocked 
 
 yeah said hagrid heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall jus nutters hermione don open em if yeh get any more chuck em straigh in the fire 
 
 you missed a really good lesson harry told hermione as they headed back toward the castle good nifflers they ron 
 
 ron however was frowning at the chocolate hagrid had given him he looked thoroughly put out about something 
 
 the matter said harry wrong flavor 
 
 no said ron shortly why you tell me about the gold 
 
 what gold said harry 
 
 the gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup said ron the leprechaun gold i gave you for my omnioculars in the top box why you tell me it disappeared 
 
 harry had to think for a moment before he realized what ron was talking about 
 
 oh he said the memory coming back to him at last i dunnoi never noticed it had gone i was more worried about my wand i 
 
 they climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the great hall for lunch 
 
 must be nice ron said abruptly when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and yorkshire puddings to have so much money you notice if a pocketful of galleons goes missing 
 
 listen i had other stuff on my mind that night said harry impatiently we all did remember 
 
 i know leprechaun gold vanishes ron muttered i thought i was paying you back you given me that chudley cannon hat for christmas 
 
 forget it all right said harry 
 
 ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork glaring at it then he said i hate being poor 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other neither of them really knew what to say 
 
 rubbish said ron still glaring down at his potato i blame fred and george for trying to make some extra money wish i could wish i had a niffler 
 
 well we know what to get you next christmas said hermione brightly then when ron continued to look gloomy she said come on ron it could be worse at least your fingers full of pus hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork her fingers were so stiff and swollen i hate that skeeter woman she burst out savagely get her back for this if the last thing i do 
 
 
 
 hate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the following week and although she followed advice and stopped opening it several of her sent howlers which exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole hall to hear even those people who read witch weekly knew all about the supposed triangle now harry was getting sick of telling people that hermione his girlfriend 
 
 die down though he told hermione if we just ignore got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time 
 
 i want to know how listening into private conversations when supposed to be banned from the grounds said hermione angrily 
 
 hermione hung back in their next defense against the dark arts lesson to ask professor moody something the rest of the class was very eager to leave moody had given them such a rigorous test of that many of them were nursing small injuries harry had such a bad case of twitchy ears he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class 
 
 well definitely not using an invisibility cloak hermione panted five minutes later catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and pulling hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her moody says he see her anywhere near the judges table at the second task or anywhere near the lake 
 
 hermione is there any point in telling you to drop this said ron 
 
 no said hermione stubbornly i want to know how she heard me talking to viktor and how she found out about mum 
 
 maybe she had you bugged said harry 
 
 bugged said ron blankly whatput fleas on her or something 
 
 harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment ron was fascinated but hermione interrupted them 
 
 you two ever going to read hogwarts a history 
 
 the point said ron you know it by heart we can just ask you 
 
 all those substitutes for magic muggles use electricity computers and radar and all those things they all go haywire around hogwarts too much magic in the air no using magic to eavesdrop she must i could just find out what it isooh if illegal have her 
 
 we got enough to worry about ron asked her do we have to start a vendetta against rita skeeter as well 
 
 not asking you to help hermione snapped do it on my own 
 
 she marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance harry was quite sure she was going to the library 
 
 the betting she comes back with a box of hate rita skeeter badges said ron 
 
 hermione however did not ask harry and ron to help her pursue vengeance against rita skeeter for which they were both grateful because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays harry frankly marveled at the fact that hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do he was working just to get through all their homework though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for sirius after last summer harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry he enclosed notes to sirius telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened and that they were still waiting for an answer from percy 
 
 hedwig return until the end of the easter holidays letter was enclosed in a package of easter eggs that mrs weasley had sent both and were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee however was smaller than a chicken egg her face fell when she saw it 
 
 your mum read witch weekly by any chance does she ron she asked quietly 
 
 yeah said ron whose mouth was full of toffee gets it for the recipes 
 
 hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg 
 
 you want to see what written harry asked her hastily 
 
 letter was short and irritated 
 
 as i am constantly telling the daily prophet mr crouch is taking a break he is sending in regular owls with instructions no i actually seen him but i think i can be trusted to know my own handwriting i have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors please bother me again unless something important happy easter 
 the start of the summer term would normally have meant that harry was training hard for the last quidditch match of the season this year however it was the third and final task in the triwizard tournament for which he needed to prepare but he still know what he would have to do finally in the last week of may professor mcgonagall held him back in transfiguration 
 
 you are to go down to the quidditch field tonight at nine potter she told him mr bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task 
 
 so at half past eight that night harry left ron and hermione in gryffindor tower and went downstairs as he crossed the entrance hall cedric came up from the hufflepuff common room 
 
 what reckon going to be he asked harry as they went together down the stone steps out into the cloudy night fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels she reckons got to find treasure 
 
 that be too bad said harry thinking that he would simply ask hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him 
 
 they walked down the dark lawn to the quidditch stadium turned through a gap in the stands and walked out onto the field 
 
 they done to it cedric said indignantly stopping dead 
 
 the quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat it looked as though somebody had been building long low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction 
 
 hedges said harry bending to examine the nearest one 
 
 hello there called a cheery voice 
 
 ludo bagman was standing in the middle of the field with krum and fleur harry and cedric made their way toward them climbing over the hedges fleur beamed at harry as he came nearer her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake 
 
 well what think said bagman happily as harry and cedric climbed over the last hedge growing nicely they give them a month and have them twenty feet high worry he added grinning spotting the expressions on and faces have your quidditch field back to normal once the task is over now i imagine you can guess what making here 
 
 no one spoke for a moment then 
 
 maze grunted krum 
 
 right said bagman a maze the third really very straightforward the triwizard cup will be placed in the center of the maze the first champion to touch it will receive full marks 
 
 we seemply ave to get through the maze said fleur 
 
 there will be obstacles said bagman happily bouncing on the balls of his feet hagrid is providing a number of creaturesthen there will be spells that must be brokenall that sort of thing you know now the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze bagman grinned at harry and cedric then mr krum will enterthen miss delacour but all be in with a fighting chance depending how well you get past the obstacles should be fun eh 
 
 harry who knew only too well the kind of creatures that hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all however he nodded politely like the other champions 
 
 very wellif you got any questions go back up to the castle shall we a bit chilly 
 
 bagman hurried alongside harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze harry had the feeling that bagman was going to start offering to help him again but just then krum tapped harry on the shoulder 
 
 could i haff a vord 
 
 yeah all right said harry slightly surprised 
 
 vill you valk vith me 
 
 okay said harry curiously 
 
 bagman looked slightly perturbed 
 
 wait for you harry shall i 
 
 no okay mr bagman said harry suppressing a smile i think i can find the castle on my own thanks 
 
 harry and krum left the stadium together but krum did not set a course for the durmstrang ship instead he walked toward the forest 
 
 we going this way for said harry as they passed cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriage 
 
 vont to be overheard said krum shortly 
 
 when at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the beauxbatons horses paddock krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face harry 
 
 i vant to know he said glowering vot there is between you and 
 
 harry who from secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this stared up at krum in amazement 
 
 nothing he said but krum glowered at him and harry somehow struck anew by how tall krum was elaborated friends not my girlfriend and she never has been just that skeeter woman making things up 
 
 talks about you very often said krum looking suspiciously at harry 
 
 yeah said harry because were friends 
 
 he quite believe he was having this conversation with viktor krum the famous international quidditch player it was as though the krum thought he harry was an equal a real rival 
 
 you haff neveryou haff not 
 
 no said harry very firmly 
 
 krum looked slightly happier he stared at harry for a few seconds then said you fly very veil i vos votching at the first task 
 
 thanks said harry grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself i saw you at the quidditch world cup the wronski feint you really 
 
 but something moved behind krum in the trees and harry who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest instinctively grabbed arm and pulled him around 
 
 vot is it 
 
 harry shook his head staring at the place where seen movement he slipped his hand inside his robes reaching for his wand 
 
 suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak for a moment harry recognize himthen he realized it was mr crouch 
 
 he looked as though he had been traveling for days the knees of his robes were ripped and bloody his face scratched he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion his neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim his strange appearance however was nothing to the way he was behaving muttering and gesticulating mr crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see he reminded harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the dursleys that man too had been conversing wildly with thin air aunt petunia had seized hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him uncle vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants 
 
 he a judge said krum staring at mr crouch he vith your ministry 
 
 harry nodded hesitated for a moment then walked slowly toward mr crouch who did not look at him but continued to talk to a nearby tree 
 
 and when done that weatherby send an owl to dumbledore confirming the number of durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve 
 
 mr crouch said harry cautiously 
 
 and then send another owl to madame maxime because she might want to up the number of students bringing now made it a round dozendo that weatherby will you will you will 
 
 mr eyes were bulging he stood staring at the tree muttering soundlessly at it then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees 
 
 mr crouch harry said loudly are you all right 
 
 eyes were rolling in his head harry looked around at krum who had followed him into the trees and was looking down at crouch in alarm 
 
 vot is wrong with him 
 
 no idea harry muttered listen better go and get someone 
 
 dumbledore gasped mr crouch he reached out and seized a handful of robes dragging him closer though his eyes were staring over head i needseedumbledore 
 
 okay said harry if you get up mr crouch we can go up to the 
 
 donestupidthing mr crouch breathed he looked utterly mad his eyes were rolling and bulging and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort musttelldumbledore 
 
 get up mr crouch said harry loudly and clearly get up take you to dumbledore 
 
 mr eyes rolled forward onto harry 
 
 whoyou he whispered 
 
 a student at the school said harry looking around at krum for some help but krum was hanging back looking extremely nervous 
 
 nothis whispered crouch his mouth sagging 
 
 no said harry without the faintest idea what crouch was talking about 
 
 
 
 right said harry 
 
 crouch was pulling him closer harry tried to loosen grip on his robes but it was too powerful 
 
 warndumbledore 
 
 get dumbledore if you let go of me said harry just let go mr crouch and get him 
 
 thank you weatherby and when you have done that i would like a cup of tea my wife and son will be arriving shortly we are attending a concert tonight with mr and mrs fudge 
 
 crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again and seemed completely unaware that harry was there which surprised harry so much he notice that crouch had released him 
 
 yes my son has recently gained twelve most satisfactory yes thank you yes very proud indeed now if you could bring me that memo from the andorran minister of magic i think i will have time to draft a response 
 
 you stay here with him harry said to krum get dumbledore be quicker i know where his office is 
 
 he is mad said krum doubtfully staring down at crouch who was still gabbling to the tree apparently convinced it was percy 
 
 just stay with him said harry starting to get up but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in mr crouch who seized him hard around the knees and pulled harry back to the ground 
 
 he whispered his eyes bulging again iescapedmust warnmust tellsee dumbledoremy faultall my faultberthadeadall my faultmy sonmy faulttell dumbledore harry potterthe dark lordstrongerharry potter 
 
 get dumbledore if you let me go mr crouch said harry he looked furiously around at krum help me will you 
 
 looking extremely apprehensive krum moved forward and squatted down next to mr crouch 
 
 just keep him here said harry pulling himself free of mr crouch be back with dumbledore 
 
 hurry you krum called after him as harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds they were deserted bagman cedric and fleur had disappeared harry tore up the stone steps through the oak front doors and off up the marble staircase toward the second floor 
 
 five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor 
 
 sher sherbet lemon he panted at it 
 
 this was the password to the hidden staircase to office or at least it had been two years ago the password had evidently changed however for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside but stood frozen glaring at harry malevolently 
 
 move harry shouted at it 
 
 but nothing at hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it he knew it was no good he looked up and down the dark corridor perhaps dumbledore was in the staffroom he started running as fast as he could toward the staircase 
 
 potter 
 
 harry skidded to a halt and looked around snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle the wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned harry back toward him 
 
 what are you doing here potter 
 
 i need to see professor dumbledore said harry running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of snape instead mr just turned in the asking 
 
 what is this rubbish said snape his black eyes glittering what are you talking about 
 
 mr crouch harry shouted from the ministry ill or something in the forest he wants to see dumbledore just give me the password up to 
 
 the headmaster is busy potter said snape his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile 
 
 got to tell dumbledore harry yelled 
 
 you hear me potter 
 
 harry could tell snape was thoroughly enjoying himself denying harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky 
 
 look said harry angrily crouch right out of his mind he says he wants to warn 
 
 the stone wall behind snape slid open dumbledore was standing there wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression is there a problem he said looking between harry and snape 
 
 professor harry said sidestepping snape before snape could speak mr crouch is here down in the forest he wants to speak to you 
 
 harry expected dumbledore to ask questions but to his relief dumbledore did nothing of the sort 
 
 lead the way he said promptly and he swept off along the corridor behind harry leaving snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly 
 
 what did mr crouch say harry said dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase 
 
 said he wants to warn yousaid done something terriblehe mentioned his sonand bertha jorkinsand and voldemortsomething about voldemort getting stronger 
 
 indeed said dumbledore and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the 
 
 not acting normally harry said hurrying along beside dumbledore he seem to know where he is he keeps talking like he thinks percy there and then he changes and says he needs to see left him with viktor krum 
 
 you did said dumbledore sharply and he began to take longer strides still so that harry was running to keep up do you know if anybody else saw mr crouch 
 
 no said harry krum and i were talking mr bagman had just finished telling us about the third task we stayed behind and then we saw mr crouch coming out of the forest 
 
 where are they said dumbledore as the beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness 
 
 over here said harry moving in front of dumbledore leading the way through the trees he hear voice anymore but he knew where he was going it been much past the beauxbatons carriagesomewhere around here 
 
 viktor harry shouted 
 
 no one answered 
 
 they were here harry said to dumbledore they were definitely somewhere around here 
 
 lumos dumbledore said lighting his wand and holding it up 
 
 its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk illuminating the ground and then it fell upon a pair of feet 
 
 harry and dumbledore hurried forward krum was sprawled on the forest floor he seemed to be unconscious there was no sign at all of mr crouch dumbledore bent over krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids 
 
 stunned he said softly his glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees 
 
 should i go and get someone said harry madam pomfrey 
 
 no said dumbledore swiftly stay here 
 
 he raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of cabin harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird then dumbledore bent over krum again pointed his wand at him and muttered ennervate 
 
 krum opened his eyes he looked dazed when he saw dumbledore he tried to sit up but dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still 
 
 he attacked me krum muttered putting a hand up to his head the old madman attacked me i vos looking around to see vare potter had gone and he attacked from behind 
 
 lie still for a moment dumbledore said 
 
 the sound of thunderous footfalls reached them and hagrid came panting into sight with fang at his heels he was carrying his crossbow 
 
 professor dumbledore he said his eyes widening harry what the 
 
 hagrid i need you to fetch professor karkaroff said dumbledore his student has been attacked when done that kindly alert professor moody 
 
 no need dumbledore said a wheezy growl here 
 
 moody was limping toward them leaning on his staff his wand lit 
 
 damn leg he said furiously been here happened snape said something about crouch 
 
 crouch said hagrid blankly 
 
 karkaroff please hagrid said dumbledore sharply 
 
 oh yeahright professor said hagrid and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees fang trotting after him 
 
 i know where barty crouch is dumbledore told moody but it is essential that we find him 
 
 onto it growled moody and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest 
 
 neither dumbledore nor harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of hagrid and fang returning karkaroff was hurrying along behind them he was wearing his sleek silver furs and he looked pale and agitated 
 
 what is this he cried when he saw krum on the ground and dumbledore and harry beside him going on 
 
 i vos attacked said krum sitting up now and rubbing his head mr crouch or votever his name 
 
 crouch attacked you crouch attacked you the triwizard judge 
 
 igor dumbledore began but karkaroff had drawn himself up clutching his furs around him looking livid 
 
 treachery he bellowed pointing at dumbledore it is a plot you and your ministry of magic have lured me here under false pretenses dumbledore this is not an equal competition first you sneak potter into the tournament though he is underage now one of your ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action i smell and corruption in this whole affair and you dumbledore you with your talk of closer international wizarding links of rebuilding old ties of forgetting old differences what i think of you 
 
 karkaroff spat onto the ground at feet in one swift movement hagrid seized the front of furs lifted him into the air and slammed him against a nearby tree 
 
 apologize hagrid snarled as karkaroff gasped for breath massive fist at his throat his feet dangling in midair 
 
 hagrid no dumbledore shouted his eyes flashing 
 
 hagrid removed the hand pinning karkaroff to the tree and karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head 
 
 kindly escort harry back up to the castle hagrid said dumbledore sharply 
 
 breathing heavily hagrid gave karkaroff a glowering look 
 
 maybe better stay here headmaster

 they marched in silence past the beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle

 hagrid was in such a bad mood harry was quite glad to say to him in front of the fat lady he clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where ron and hermione were sitting to tell them what had happened
