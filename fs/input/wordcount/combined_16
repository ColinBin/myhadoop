 harry had no idea what hermione was planning or even whether she had a plan he walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside office knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going he did not dare attempt to talk to her umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing 
 
 hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall the din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the great hallit seemed incredible to harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner celebrating the end of exams not a care in the world 
 
 hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air the sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest now and as hermione marched purposefully across the grassumbridge jogging to keep uptheir long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks 
 
 hidden in hut is it said umbridge eagerly in ear 
 
 of course not said hermione scathingly hagrid might have set it off accidentally 
 
 yes said umbridge whose excitement seemed to be mounting yes he would have done of course the great oaf 
 
 she laughed harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat but resisted his scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned as he knew it would if voldemort had moved in for the kill 
 
 th en where is it asked umbridge with a hint or uncertainty in her voice as hermione continued to stride towards the forest 
 
 in there of course said hermione pointing into the dark trees it had to be somewhere that students going to find it accidentally it 
 
 of course said umbridge though she sounded a little apprehensive now of course very well then you two stay ahead of me 
 
 can we have your wand then if going first harry asked her 
 
 no i think so mr potter said umbridge sweetly poking him in the back with it the ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours afraid 
 
 as they reached the cool shade of the first trees harry tried to catch eye walking into the forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening she however merely gave umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees moving at such a pace that umbridge with her shorter legs had difficulty in keeping up 
 
 is it very far in umbridge asked as her robe ripped on a bramble 
 
 oh yes said hermione yes well hidden 
 
 misgivings increased hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit grawp but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster aragog hermione had not been with him on that occasion he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it 
 
 erare you sure this is the right way he asked her pointedly 
 
 oh yes she said in a steely voice crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise behind them umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling neither of them paused to help her up again hermione merely strode on calling loudly over her shoulder a bit further in 
 
 hermione keep your voice down harry muttered hurrying to catch up with her anything could be listening in here 
 
 i want us heard she answered quietly as umbridge jogged noisily after them see 
 
 they walked on for what seemed a long time until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest one of being watched by unseen eyes 
 
 how much further demanded umbridge angrily from behind him 
 
 not far now shouted hermione as they emerged into a dim dank clearing just a little bit 
 
 an arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head the air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves harry could feel the forest floor trembling umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield 
 
 he wrenched himself free of her and turned around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side their bows raised and loaded pointing at harry hermione and umbridge they backed slowly into the centre of the clearing umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror harry looked sideways at hermione she was wearing a triumphant smile 
 
 who are you said a voice 
 
 harry looked left the centaur called magorian was walking towards them out of the circle his bow like those of the others was raised on right umbridge was still whimpering her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur 
 
 i asked you who are you human said magorian roughly 
 
 i am dolores umbridge said umbridge in a terrified voice senior undersecretary to the minister for magic and headmistress and high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 you are from the ministry of magic said magorian as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly 
 
 right said umbridge in an even higher voice so be very careful by the laws laid down by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures any attack by such as yourselves on a human 
 
 what did you call us shouted a black centaur whom harry recognised as bane there was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them 
 
 call them that hermione said furiously but umbridge did not appear to have heard her still pointing her shaking wand at magorian she continued law fifteen b states clearly that any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have intelligence and therefore considered responsible for its actions 
 
 intelligence repeated magorian as bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground we consider that a great insult human our intelligence thankfully far outstrips your own 
 
 what are you doing in our forest bellowed the grey centaur harry and hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest why are you here 
 
 your forest said umbridge shaking now not only with fright but also it seemed with indignation i would remind you that you live here only because the ministry of magic permits you certain areas of land 
 
 an arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing she let out an scream and threw her hands over her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously the sound of their wild neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving 
 
 whose forest is it now human bellowed bane 
 
 filthy she screamed her hands still tight over her head beasts uncontrolled animals 
 
 be quiet shouted hermione but it was too late umbridge pointed her wand at magorian and screamed incarcerous 
 
 ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes wrapping themselves tightly around the torso and trapping his arms he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs attempting to free himself while the other centaurs charged 
 
 harry grabbed hermione and pulled her to the ground face down on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him but the centaurs leapt over and around them bellowing and screaming with rage 
 
 nooooo he heard umbridge shriek noooooo i am senior undersecretary you cannotunhand me you animals nooooo 
 
 harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to stun one of them then she screamed very loudly lifting his head a few inches harry saw that umbridge had been seized from behind by bane and lifted high into the air wriggling and yelling with fright her wand fell from her hand to the ground and heart leapt if he could just reach it 
 
 but as he stretched out a hand towards it a hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half 
 
 now roared a voice in ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright hermione too had been pulled to her feet over the plunging backs and heads of the centaurs harry saw umbridge being borne away through the trees by bane screaming her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them 
 
 and these said the grey centaur holding hermione 
 
 they are young said a slow doleful voice from behind harry we do not attack foals 
 
 they brought her here ronan replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on harry and they are not so young he is nearing manhood this one 
 
 he shook harry by the neck of his robes 
 
 please said hermione breathlessly please attack us we think like her we ministry of magic employees we only came in here because we hoped drive her off for us 
 
 harry knew at once from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this the grey centaur threw back his head his back legs stamping furiously and bellowed you see ronan they already have the arrogance of their kind so we were to do your dirty work were we human girl we were to act as your servants drive away your enemies like obedient hounds 
 
 no said hermione in a horrorstruck squeak pleasei mean that i just hoped be able toto help us 
 
 but she seemed to be going from bad to worse 
 
 we do not help humans snarled the centaur holding harry tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time so that feet left the ground momentarily we are a race apart and proud to be so we will not permit you to walk from here boasting that we did your bidding 
 
 not going to say anything like that harry shouted we know you do what you did because we wanted you to 
 
 but nobody seemed to be listening to him 
 
 a bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted they came here unasked they must pay the consequences 
 
 a roar of approval met these words and a centaur shouted they can join the woman 
 
 you said you hurt the innocent shouted hermione real tears sliding down her face now we done anything to hurt you we used wands or threats we just want to go back to school please let us go back 
 
 we are not all like the traitor firenze human girl shouted the grey centaur to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses we are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults we do not recognise your laws we do not acknowledge your superiority we are 
 
 but they did not hear what else centaurs were for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them harry hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing looked around centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows hermione had been dropped too and harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of grawp the giant appeared in the gap 
 
 the centaurs nearest him backed into those behind the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the his dull eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet broken ropes trailed from both ankles 
 
 he opened his mouth even wider 
 
 hagger 
 
 harry did not know what hagger meant or what language it was from nor did he much care he was watching feet which were almost as long as whole body hermione gripped his arm tightly the centaurs were quite silent staring up at the giant whose huge round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped 
 
 hagger he said again more insistently 
 
 get away from here giant called magorian you are not welcome among us 
 
 these words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on grawp he stooped a little the centaurs arms tensed on their bows then bellowed hagger 
 
 a few of the centaurs looked worried now hermione however gave a gasp 
 
 harry she whispered i think trying to say hagrid 
 
 at this precise moment grawp caught sight of them the only two humans in a sea of centaurs he lowered his head another foot or so staring intently at them harry could feel hermione shaking as grawp opened his mouth wide again and said in a deep rumbling voice hermy 
 
 goodness said hermione gripping arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint hehe remembered 
 
 hermy roared grawp where hagger 
 
 i know squealed hermione terrified sorry grawp i know 
 
 grawp want hagger 
 
 one of the giants massive hands reached down hermione let out a real scream ran a few steps backwards and fell over devoid of a wand harry braced himself to punch kick bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a centaur off his legs 
 
 it was what the centaurs had been waiting outstretched fingers were a foot from harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant peppering his enormous face causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up rubbing his face with his enormous hands breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper 
 
 he yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaur scattered out of the way droplets of blood showered harry as he pulled hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees once there they looked back grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his face they were retreating in disorder galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing harry and hermione watched grawp give another roar of fury and plunge after them smashing more trees aside as he went 
 
 oh no said hermione quaking so badly that her knees gave way oh that was horrible and he might kill them all 
 
 not that fussed to be honest said harry bitterly 
 
 the sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter as harry listened to them his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him 
 
 they had wasted so much timethey were even further from rescuing sirius than they had been when he had had the vision not only had harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the forbidden forest with no means of transport whatsoever 
 
 smart plan he spat at hermione having to release some of his fury really smart plan where do we go from here 
 
 we need to get back up to the castle said hermione faintly 
 
 by the time done that probably be dead said harry kicking a nearby tree in temper a chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him 
 
 well we do anything without wands said hermione hopelessly dragging herself up again anyway harry how exactly were you planning to get all the way to london 
 
 yeah we were just wondering that said a familiar voice from behind her 
 
 harry and hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees 
 
 ron came into sight closely followed by ginny neville and luna all of them looked a little the worse for wearthere were several long scratches running the length of cheek a large purple lump was swelling above right eye lip was bleeding worse than everbut all were looking rather pleased with themselves 
 
 so said ron pushing aside a branch and holding out wand had any ideas 
 
 how did you get away asked harry in amazement taking his wand from ron 
 
 couple of stunners a disarming charm neville brought off a really nice little impediment jinx said ron airily now handing back wand too but ginny was best she got malfoybat bogey hexit was superb his whole face was covered in the great flapping things anyway we saw you out of the window heading into the forest and followed you done with umbridge 
 
 she got carried away said harry by a herd of centaurs 
 
 and they left you behind asked ginny looking astonished 
 
 no they got chased off by grawp said harry 
 
 grawp luna asked interestedly 
 
 little brother said ron promptly anyway never mind that now harry what did you find out in the fire has got sirius or 
 
 yes said harry as his scar gave another painful prickle and sure sirius is still alive but i see how going to get there to help him 
 
 they all fell silent looking rather scared the problem facing them seemed insurmountable 
 
 well have to fly we said luna in the closest thing to a voice harry had ever heard her use 
 
 ok said harry irritably rounding on her first of all we doing anything if including yourself in that and second of all me only one with a broomstick that being guarded by a security troll so 
 
 got a broom said ginny 
 
 yeah but not coming said ron angrily 
 
 excuse me but i care what happens to sirius as much as you do said ginny her jaw set so that her resemblance to fred and george was suddenly striking 
 
 too harry began but ginny said fiercely three years older than you were when you fought over the philosophers stone and because of me that stuck back in office with giant flying bogies attacking him 
 
 yeah but 
 
 we were all in the da together said neville quietly it was all supposed to be about fighting it and this is the first chance had to do something realor was that all just a game or something 
 
 noof course it said harry impatiently 
 
 then we should come too said neville simply we want to help 
 
 right said luna smiling happily 
 
 eyes met he knew ron was thinking exactly what he was if he could have chosen any members of the da in addition to himself ron and hermione to join him in the attempt to rescue sirius he would not have picked ginny neville or luna 
 
 well it matter anyway said harry through gritted teeth because we still know how to get there 
 
 i thought settled that said luna maddeningly flying 
 
 look said ron barely containing his anger you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us sprout wings whenever we 
 
 there are ways of flying other than with broomsticks said luna serenely 
 
 i going to ride on the back of the kacky snorgle or whatever it is ron demanded 
 
 the snorkack fly said luna in a dignified voice but they can and hagrid says very good at finding places their riders are looking for 
 
 harry whirled round standing between two trees their white eyes gleaming eerily were two thestrals watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word 
 
 yes he whispered moving towards them they tossed their reptilian heads throwing back long black manes and harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest shining neck how could he ever have thought them ugly 
 
 is it those mad horse things said ron uncertainly staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral harry was patting those ones you see unless watched someone snuff it 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 how many 
 
 just two 
 
 well we need three said hermione who was still looking a little shaken but determined just the same 
 
 four hermione said ginny scowling 
 
 i think there are six of us actually said luna calmly counting 
 
 be stupid we all go said harry angrily look you three he pointed at neville ginny and luna not involved in this not 
 
 they burst into more protests his scar gave another more painful twinge every moment they delayed was precious he did not have time to argue 
 
 ok fine your choice he said curtly but unless we can find more thestrals not going to be able 
 
 oh more of them will come said ginny confidently who like ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses 
 
 what makes you think that 
 
 because in case you noticed you and hermione are both covered in blood she said coolly and we know hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat probably why these two turned up in the first place 
 
 harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve which was damp with blood 
 
 ok then he said a bright idea occurring ron and i will take these two and go ahead and hermione can stay here with you three and attract more thestrals 
 
 not staying behind said hermione furiously 
 
 no need said luna smiling look here come more now you two must really smell 
 
 harry turned no fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking their way through the trees their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies their eyes gleaming through the darkness he had no excuse now 
 
 all right he said angrily pick one and get on then 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the princes talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry remained kneeling at snapes side simply staring down at him until quite suddenly a high cold voice spoke so close to them that harry jumped on his feet the flask gripped tightly in his hands thinking that voldemort had reentered the room 
 
 voldemorts voice reverberated from the walls and floor and harry realized that he was talking to hogwarts and to all the surrounding area that the residents of hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them his breath on the back of their necks a deathblow away 
 
 you have fought said the high cold voice valiantly lord voldemort knows how to value bravery 
 
 yet you have sustained heavy losses if you continue to resist me you will all die one by one i do not wish this to happen every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste 
 
 lord voldemort is merciful i command my forces to retreat immediately 
 
 you have one hour dispose of your dead with dignity treat your injured 
 
 i speak now harry potter directly to you you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest if at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences this time i shall enter the fray myself harry potter and i shall find you and i shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me one hour 
 
 both ron and hermione shook their heads frantically looking at harry 
 
 dont listen to him said ron 
 
 itll be all right said hermione wildly lets c lets get back to the castle if hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan c 
 
 she glanced at snapes body then hurried back to the tunnel entrance ron followed her harry gathered up the invisibility cloak then looked down at snape he did not know what to feel except shock at the way snape had been killed and the reason for which it had been done 
 
 they crawled back through the tunnel none of them talking and harry wondered whether ron and hermione could still hear voldemort ringing in their heads as he could 
 
 you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forestone hour 
 
 small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle it could only be an hour or so from dawn yet it was the three of them hurried toward the stone steps a lone dog the size of a small boat lay abandoned in front of them there was no other sign of grawp or of his attacker 
 
 the castle was unnaturally silent there were no flashes of light now no bangs or screams or shouts the flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood part of the banisters had been blown away 
 
 where is everyone whispered hermione 
 
 ron led the way to the great hall harry stopped in the doorway 
 
 the house tables were gone and the room was crowded the survivors stood in groups their arms around each others necks the injured were being treated upon the raised platform by madam pomfrey and a group of helpers firenze was amongst the injured his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay unable to stand 
 
 the dead lay in a row in the middle of the hall harry could not see freds body because his family surrounded him george was kneeling at his head mrs weasley was lying across freds chest her body shaking mr weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks 
 
 without a word to harry ron and hermione walked away harry saw hermione approach ginny whose face was swollen and blotchy and hug her ron joined bill fleur and percy who flung an arm around rons shoulders as ginny and hermione moved closer to the rest of the family harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to fred remus and tonks pale and still and apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling 
 
 the great hall seemed to fly away become smaller shrink as harry reeled backward from the doorway he could not draw breath he could not bear to look at any of the other bodies to see who else had died for him he could not bear to join the weasleys could not look into their eyes when if he had given himself up in the first place fred might never have died 
 
 he turned away and ran up the marble staircase lupin tonks he yearned not to feel he wished he could rip out his heart his innards everything that was screaming inside him 
 
 the castle was completely empty even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the great hall harry ran without stopping clutching the crystal flask of snapes last thoughts and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmasters office 
 
 password 
 
 dumbledore said harry without thinking because it was he whom he yearned to see and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind 
 
 but when harry burst into the circular office he found a change the portraits that hung all around the walls were empty not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him all it seemed had flitted away charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on 
 
 harry glanced hopelessly at dumbledores deserted frame which hung directly behind the headmasters chair then turned his back on it the stone pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been harry heaved it onto the desk and poured snapes memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge to escape into someone elses head would be a blessed relief nothing that even snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts the memories swirled silver white and strange and without hesitating with a feeling of reckless abandonment as though this would assuage his torturing grief harry dived 
 
 he fell headlong into sunlight and his feet found warm ground when he straightened up he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground a single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline two girls were swinging backward and forward and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes his black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate too short jeans a shabby overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man an odd smocklike shirt 
 
 harry moved closer to the boy snape looked no more than nine or ten years old sallow small stringy there was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister 
 
 lily dont do it shrieked the elder of the two 
 
 but the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air quite literally flown launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt she soared like a trapeze artist through the air staying up far too long landing far too lightly 
 
 mummy told you not to 
 
 petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground making a crunching grinding sound then leapt up hands on hips 
 
 mummy said you werent allowed lily 
 
 but im fine said lily still giggling tuney look at this watch what i can do 
 
 petunia glanced around the playground was deserted apart from themselves and though the girls did not know it snape lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which snape lurked petunia advanced evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval lily waited until petunia was near enough to have a clear view then held out her palm the flower sat there opening and closing its petals like some bizarre oyster 
 
 stop it shrieked petunia 
 
 its not hurting you said lily but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground 
 
 its not right said petunia but her eyes had followed the flowers flight to the ground and lingered upon it how do you do it she added and there was definite longing in her voice 
 
 its obvious isnt it snape could no longer contain himself but had jumped out from behind the bushes petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings but lily though clearly startled remained where she was snape seemed to regret his appearance a dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at lily 
 
 whats obvious asked lily 
 
 snape had an air of nervous excitement with a glance at the distant petunia now hovering beside the swings he lowered his voice and said i know what you are 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 youreyoure a witch whispered snape 
 
 she looked affronted 
 
 thats not a very nice thing to say to somebody 
 
 she turned nose in the air and marched off toward her sister 
 
 no said snape he was highly colored now and harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it he flapped after the girls looking ludicrously batlike like his older self 
 
 the sisters considered him united in disapproval both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag 
 
 you are said snape to lily you are a witch ive been watching you for a while but theres nothing wrong with that my mums one and im a wizard 
 
 petunias laugh was like cold water 
 
 wizard she shrieked her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance i know who you are youre that snape boy they live down spinners end by the river she told lily and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation why have you been spying on us 
 
 havent been spying said snape hot and uncomfortable and in the bright sunlight wouldnt spy on you anyway he added spitefully youre a muggle 
 
 though petunia evidently did not understand the word she could hardly mistake the tone 
 
 lily come on were leaving she said shrilly lily obeyed her sister at once glaring at snape as she left he stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate and harry the only one left to observe him recognized snapes bitter disappointment and understood that snape had been planning this moment for a while and that it had all gone wrong 
 
 the scene dissolved and before harry knew it around him he was now in a small thicket of trees he could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks the shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade two children sat facing each other on the ground snape had removed his coat now his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light 
 
 and the ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters 
 
 but i have done magic outside school 
 
 were all right we havent got wands yet they let you off when youre a kid and you cant help it but once youre eleven he nodded importantly and they start training you then youve got to go careful 
 
 there was a little silence lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air and harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it then she dropped the twig leaned in toward the boy and said it is real isnt it its not a joke petunia says youre lying to me petunia says there isnt a hogwarts it is real isnt it 
 
 its real for us said snape not for her but well get the letter you and me 
 
 really whispered lily 
 
 definitely said snape and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her brimful of confidence in his destiny 
 
 and will it really come by owl lily whispered 
 
 normally said snape but youre so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents 
 
 does it make a difference being 
 
 snape hesitated his black eyes eager in the greenish gloom moved over the pale face the dark red hair 
 
 no he said it doesnt make any difference 
 
 good said lily relaxing it was clear that she had been worrying 
 
 youve got loads of magic said snape i saw that all the time i was watching you 
 
 his voice trailed away she was not listening but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead he watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground 
 
 how are things at your house lily asked 
 
 a little crease appeared between his eyes 
 
 fine he said 
 
 theyre not arguing anymore 
 
 oh yes theyre arguing said snape he picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart apparently unaware of what he was doing but it wont be that long and ill be gone 
 
 doesnt your dad like magic 
 
 he doesnt like anything much said snape 
 
 severus 
 
 a little smile twisted snapes mouth when she said his name 
 
 yeah 
 
 tell me about the dementors again 
 
 what dyou want to know about them for 
 
 if i use magic outside school c 
 
 they wouldnt give you to the dementors for that dementors are for people who do really bad stuff they guard the wizard prison azkaban youre not going to end up in azkaban youre too c 
 
 he turned red again and shredded more leaves then a small rustling noise behind harry made him turn petunia hiding behind a tree had lost her footing 
 
 tuney said lily surprise and welcome in her voice but snape had jumped to his feet 
 
 whos spying now he shouted what dyou want 
 
 petunia was breathless alarmed at being caught harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say 
 
 what is that youre wearing anyway she said pointing at snapes chest your mums blouse 
 
 there was a crack a branch over petunias head had fallen lily screamed the branch caught petunia on the shoulder and she staggered backward and burst into tears 
 
 tuney 
 
 but petunia was running away lily rounded on snape 
 
 did you make that happen 
 
 no he looked both defiant and scared 
 
 you did she was backing away from him you did you hurt her 
 
 no c no i didnt 
 
 but the lie did not convince lily after one last burning look she ran from the little thicket off after her sister and snape looked miserable and confused 
 
 and the scene harry looked around he was on platform nine and three quarters and snape stood beside him slightly hunched next to a thin woman who greatly resembled him snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away the two girls stood a little apart from their parents lily seemed to be pleading with her sister harry moved closer to listen 
 
 im sorry tuney im sorry listen c she caught her sisters hand and held tight to it even though petunia tried to pull it away maybe once im there c no listen tuney maybe once im there ill be able to go to professor dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind 
 
 i dont c want c to c go said petunia and she dragged her hand back out of her sisters grasp you think i want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a c a 
 
 her pale eyes roved over the platform over the cats mewling in their owners arms over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages over the students some already in their long black robes loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart 
 
 c you think i want to be a c a freak 
 
 lilys eyes filled with tears as petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away 
 
 im not a freak said lily thats a horrible thing to say 
 
 thats where youre going said petunia with relish a special school for freaks you and that snape boyweirdos thats what you two are its good youre being separated from normal people its for our safety 
 
 lily glanced toward her parents who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment drinking in the scene then she looked back at her sister and her voice was low and fierce 
 
 you didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you 
 
 petunia turned scarlet 
 
 beg i didnt beg 
 
 i saw his reply it was very kind 
 
 you shouldnt have read c whispered petunia that was my private c how could you c 
 
 lily gave herself away by toward where snape stood nearby petunia gasped 
 
 that boy found it you and that boy have been sneaking in my room 
 
 no c not sneaking c now lily was on the defensive severus saw the envelope and he couldnt believe a muggle could have contacted hogwarts thats all he says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of c 
 
 apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere said petunia now as pale as she had been flushed freak she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood 
 
 the scene dissolved again snape was hurrying along the corridor of the hogwarts express as it clattered through the countryside he had already changed into his school robes had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful muggle clothes at last he stopped outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking hunched in a corner seat beside the window was lily her face pressed against the windowpane 
 
 snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite lily she glanced at him and then looked back out of the window she had been crying 
 
 i dont want to talk to you she said in a constricted voice 
 
 why not 
 
 tuney me because we saw that letter from dumbledore 
 
 so what 
 
 she threw him a look of deep dislike 
 
 so shes my sister 
 
 shes only a c he caught himself quickly lily too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed did not hear him 
 
 but were going he said unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice this is it were off to hogwarts 
 
 she nodded mopping her eyes but in spite of herself she half smiled 
 
 youd better be in slytherin said snape encouraged that she had brightened a little 
 
 slytherin 
 
 one of the boys sharing the compartment who had shown no interest at all in lily or snape until that point looked around at the word and harry whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window saw his father slight like snape but with that indefinable air of having been even adored that snape so conspicuously lacked 
 
 who wants to be in slytherin i think id leave wouldnt you james asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him and with a jolt harry realized that it was sirius sirius did not smile 
 
 my whole family have been in slytherin he said 
 
 blimey said james and i thought you seemed all right 
 
 sirius grinned 
 
 maybe ill break the tradition where are you heading if youve got the choice 
 
 james lifted an invisible sword 
 
 gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart like my dad 
 
 snape made a small disparaging noise james turned on him 
 
 got a problem with that 
 
 no said snape though his slight sneer said otherwise if youd rather be brawny than brainy c 
 
 wherere you hoping to go seeing as youre neither interjected sirius 
 
 james roared with laughter lily sat up rather flushed and looked from james to sirius in dislike 
 
 come on severus lets find another compartment 
 
 oooooo 
 
 james and sirius imitated her lofty voice james tried to trip snape as he passed 
 
 see ya snivellus a voice called as the compartment door slammed 
 
 and the scene dissolved once more 
 
 harry was standing right behind snape as they faced the candlelit house tables lined with rapt faces then professor mcgonagall said evans lily 
 
 he watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool professor mcgonagall dropped the sorting hat onto her head and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the hat cried gryffindor 
 
 harry heard snape let out a tiny groan lily took off the hat handed it back to professor mcgonagall then hurried toward the cheering gryffindors but as she went she glanced back at snape and there was a sad little smile on her face harry saw sirius move up the bench to make room for her she took one look at him seemed to recognize him from the train folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him 
 
 the roll call continued harry watched lupin pettigrew and his father join lily and sirius at the gryffindor table at last when only a dozen students remained to be sorted professor mcgonagall called snape 
 
 harry walked with him to the stool watched him place the hat upon his head slytherin cried the sorting hat 
 
 and severus snape moved off to the other side of the hall away from lily to where the slytherins were cheering him to where lucius malfoy a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest patted snape on the back as he sat down beside him 
 
 and the scene changed 
 
 lily and snape were walking across the castle courtyard evidently arguing harry hurried to catch up with them to listen in as he reached them he realized how much taller they both were a few years seemed to have passed since their sorting 
 
 thought we were supposed to be friends snape was saying best friends 
 
 we are sev but i dont like some of the people youre hanging round with im sorry but i detest avery and mulciber mulciber what do you see in him sev hes creepy dyou know what he tried to do to mary macdonald the other day 
 
 lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it looking up into the thin sallow face 
 
 that was nothing said snape it was a laugh thats all c 
 
 it was dark magic and if you think thats funny c 
 
 what about the stuff potter and his mates get up to demanded snape his color rose again as he said it unable it seemed to hold in his resentment 
 
 whats potter got to do with anything said lily 
 
 they sneak out at night theres something weird about that lupin where does he keep going 
 
 hes ill said lily they say hes ill c 
 
 every month at the full moon said snape 
 
 i know your theory said lily and she sounded cold why are you so obsessed with them anyway why do you care what theyre doing at night 
 
 im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are 
 
 the intensity of his gaze made her blush 
 
 they dont use dark magic though she dropped her voice and youre being really ungrateful i heard what happened the other night you went sneaking down that tunnel by the whomping willow and james potter saved you from whatevers down there c 
 
 snapes whole face contorted and he spluttered saved saved you think he was playing the hero he was saving his neck and his friends too youre not going to c i wont let you c 
 
 let me let me 
 
 lilys bright green eyes were slits snape backtracked at once 
 
 i didnt mean c i just dont want to see you made a fool of c he fancies you james potter fancies you the words seemed wrenched from him against his will and hes noteveryone thinksbig quidditch hero c snapes bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent and lilys eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead 
 
 i know james potters an arrogant toerag she said cutting across snape i dont need you to tell me that but mulcibers and averys idea of humor is just evil evil sev i dont understand how you can be friends with them 
 
 harry doubted that snape had even heard her strictures on mulciber and avery the moment she had insulted james potter his whole body had relaxed and as they walked away there was a new spring in snapes step 
 
 and the scene dissolved 
 
 harry watched again as snape left the great hall after sitting his in defense against the dark arts watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where james sirius lupin and pettigrew sat together but harry kept his distance this time because he knew what happened after james had hoisted severus into the air and taunted him he knew what had been done and said and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again he watched as lily joined the group and went to snapes defense distantly he heard snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury the unforgivable word mudblood 
 
 the scene changed 
 
 im sorry 
 
 im not interested 
 
 im sorry 
 
 save your breath 
 
 it was nighttime lily who was wearing a dressing gown stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the fat lady at the entrance to gryffindor tower 
 
 i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here 
 
 i was i would have done i never meant to call you mudblood it just c 
 
 slipped out there was no pity in lilys voice its too late ive made excuses for you for years none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you you and your precious little death eater friends c you see you dont even deny it you dont even deny thats what youre all aiming to be you cant wait to join can you 
 
 he opened his mouth but closed it without speaking 
 
 i cant pretend anymore youve chosen your way ive chosen mine 
 
 no c listen i didnt mean c 
 
 c to call me mudblood but you call everyone of my birth mudblood severus why should i be any different 
 
 he struggled on the verge of speech but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole 
 
 the corridor dissolved and the scene took a little longer to reform harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop forlorn and cold in the darkness the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees the adult snape was panting turning on the spot his wand gripped tightly in his hand waiting for something or for someone his fear infected harry too even though he knew that he could not be harmed and he looked over his shoulder wondering what it was that snape was waiting for c then a blinding jagged jet of white light flew through the air harry thought of lightning but snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand 
 
 dont kill me 
 
 that was not my intention 
 
 any sound of dumbledore apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches he stood before snape with his robes whipping around him and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand 
 
 well severus what message does lord voldemort have for me 
 
 no c no message c im here on my own account 
 
 snape was wringing his hands he looked a little mad with his straggling black hair flying around him 
 
 i c i come with a warning c no a request c please c 
 
 dumbledore flicked his wand though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and snape faced each other 
 
 what request could a death eater make of me 
 
 the c the prophecythe predictiontrelawney 
 
 ah yes said dumbledore how much did you relay to lord voldemort 
 
 everything c everything i heard said snape that is why c it is for that reason c he thinks it means lily evans 
 
 the prophecy did not refer to a woman said dumbledore it spoke of a boy born at the end of july c 
 
 you know what i mean he thinks it means her son he is going to hunt her down c kill them all c 
 
 if she means so much to you said dumbledore surely lord voldemort will spare her could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son 
 
 i have c i have asked him c 
 
 you disgust me said dumbledore and harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice snape seemed to shrink a little you do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child they can die as long as you have what you want 
 
 snape said nothing but merely looked up at dumbledore 
 
 hide them all then he croaked keep her c them c safe please 
 
 and what will you give me in return severus 
 
 in c in return snape gaped at dumbledore and harry expected him to protest but after a long moment he said anything 
 
 the hilltop faded and harry stood in dumbledores office and something was making a terrible sound like a wounded animal snape was slumped forward in a chair and dumbledore was standing over him looking grim after a moment or two snape raised his face and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop 
 
 i thoughtyou were goingto keep hersafe 
 
 she and james put their faith in the wrong person said dumbledore rather like you severus werent you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her 
 
 snapes breathing was shallow 
 
 her boy survives said dumbledore 
 
 with a tiny jerk of the head snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly 
 
 her son lives he has her eyes precisely her eyes you remember the shape and color of lily evanss eyes i am sure 
 
 dont bellowed snape gonedead 
 
 is this remorse severus 
 
 i wishi wish i were dead 
 
 and what use would that be to anyone said dumbledore coldly if you loved lily evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear 
 
 snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain and dumbledores words appeared to take a long time to reach him 
 
 what c what do you mean 
 
 you know how and why she died make sure it was not in vain help me protect lilys son 
 
 he does not need protection the dark lord has gone c 
 
 the dark lord will return and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does 
 
 there was a long pause and slowly snape regained control of himself mastered his own breathing at last he said very well very well but never c never tell dumbledore this must be between us swear it i cannot bearespecially potters soni want your word 
 
 my word severus that i shall never reveal the best of you dumbledore sighed looking down into snapes ferocious anguished face if you insist 
 
 the office dissolved but instantly snape was pacing up and down in front of dumbledore 
 
 c mediocre arrogant as his father a determined delighted to find himself famous and impertinent c 
 
 you see what you expect to see severus said dumbledore without raising his eyes from a copy of transfiguration today other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented personally i find him an engaging child 
 
 dumbledore turned a page and said without looking up keep an eye on quirrell wont you 
 
 a whirl of color and now everything darkened and snape and dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall while the last stragglers from the yule ball passed them on their way to bed 
 
 well murmured dumbledore 
 
 karkaroffs mark is becoming darker too he is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell snape looked sideways at dumbledores profile karkaroff intends to flee if the mark burns 
 
 does he said dumbledore softly as fleur delacour and roger davies came giggling in from the grounds and are you tempted to join him 
 
 no said snape his black eyes on fleurs and rogers retreating figures i am not such a coward 
 
 no agreed dumbledore you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff you know i sometimes think we sort too soon 
 
 he walked away leaving snape looking stricken 
 
 and now harry stood in the headmasters office yet again it was nighttime and dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk apparently semiconscious his right hand dangled over the side blackened and burned snape was muttering incantations pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down dumbledores throat after a moment or two dumbledores eyelids fluttered and opened 
 
 why said snape without preamble why did you put on that ring it carries a curse surely you realized that why even touch it 
 
 marvolo gaunts ring lay on the desk before dumbledore it was cracked the sword of gryffindor lay beside it 
 
 dumbledore grimaced 
 
 iwas a fool sorely tempted 
 
 tempted by what 
 
 dumbledore did not answer 
 
 it is a miracle you managed to return here snape sounded furious that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being c 
 
 dumbledore raised his blackened useless hand and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio 
 
 you have done very well severus how long do you think i have 
 
 dumbledores tone was conversational he might have been asking for a weather forecast snape hesitated and then said i cannot tell maybe a year there is no halting such a spell forever it will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time 
 
 dumbledore smiled the news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him 
 
 i am fortunate extremely fortunate that i have you severus 
 
 if you had only summoned me a little earlier i might have been able to do more buy you more time said snape furiously he looked down at the broken ring and the sword did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse 
 
 something like thati was delirious no doubt said dumbledore with an effort he straightened himself in his chair well really this makes matters much more straightforward 
 
 snape looked utterly perplexed dumbledore smiled 
 
 i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me 
 
 snape sat down in the chair harry had so often occupied across the desk from dumbledore harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of dumbledores cursed hand but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further scowling snape said the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed this is merely punishment for luciuss recent failures slow torture for dracos parents while they watch him fail and pay the price 
 
 in short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have said dumbledore now i should have thought the natural successor to the job once draco fails is yourself 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 that i think is the dark lords plan 
 
 lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at hogwarts 
 
 he believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes 
 
 and if it does fall into his grasp said dumbledore almost it seemed as an aside i have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at hogwarts 
 
 snape gave a stiff nod 
 
 good now then your first priority will be to discover what draco is up to a frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself offer him help and guidance he ought to accept he likes you c 
 
 c much less since his father has lost favor draco blames me he thinks i have usurped luciuss position 
 
 all the same try i am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from lord voldemorts wrath 
 
 snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked are you intending to let him kill you 
 
 certainly not you must kill me 
 
 there was a long silence broken only by an odd clicking noise fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone 
 
 would you like me to do it now asked snape his voice heavy with irony or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph 
 
 oh not quite yet said dumbledore smiling i daresay the moment will present itself in due course given what has happened tonight he indicated his withered hand we can be sure that it will happen within a year 
 
 if you dont mind dying said snape roughly why not let draco do it 
 
 that boys soul is not yet so damaged said dumbledore i would not have it ripped apart on my account 
 
 and my soul dumbledore mine 
 
 you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation said dumbledore i ask this one great favor of you severus because death is coming for me as surely as the chudley cannons will finish bottom of this years league i confess i should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance greyback is involved c i hear voldemort has recruited him or dear bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it 
 
 his tone was light but his blue eyes pierced snape as they had frequently pierced harry as though the soul they discussed was visible to him at last snape gave another curt nod 
 
 dumbledore seemed satisfied 
 
 thank you severus 
 
 the office disappeared and now snape and dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight 
 
 what are you doing with potter all these evenings you are closeted together snape asked abruptly 
 
 dumbledore looked weary 
 
 why you arent trying to give him more detentions severus the boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out 
 
 he is his father over again c 
 
 in looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers i spend time with harry because i have things to discuss with him information i must give him before it is too late 
 
 information repeated snape you trust himyou do not trust me 
 
 it is not a question of trust i have as we both know limited time it is essential that i give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do 
 
 and why may i not have the same information 
 
 i prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of lord voldemort 
 
 which i do on your orders 
 
 and you do it extremely well do not think that i underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself severus to give voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job i would entrust to nobody but you 
 
 yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the dark lords mind 
 
 voldemort fears that connection said dumbledore not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing harrys mind means to him it was pain such as he has never experienced he will not try to possess harry again i am sure of it not in that way 
 
 i dont understand 
 
 lord voldemorts soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like harrys like a tongue on frozen steel like flesh in flame c 
 
 souls we were talking of minds 
 
 in the case of harry and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other 
 
 dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone they were close by the forbidden forest now but there was no sign of anyone near them 
 
 after you have killed me severus c 
 
 you refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me snarled snape and real anger flared in the thin face now you take a great deal for granted dumbledore perhaps i have changed my mind 
 
 you gave me your word severus and while we are talking about services you owe me i thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young slytherin friend 
 
 snape looked angry mutinous dumbledore sighed 
 
 come to my office tonight severus at eleven and you shall not complain that i have no confidence in you 
 
 they were back in dumbledores office the windows dark and fawkes sat silent as snape sat quite still as dumbledore walked around him talking 
 
 harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done 
 
 but what must he do 
 
 that is between harry and me now listen closely severus there will come a time c after my death c do not argue do not interrupt there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake 
 
 for nagini snape looked astonished 
 
 precisely if there comes a time when lord voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then i think it will be safe to tell harry 
 
 tell him what 
 
 dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes 
 
 tell him that on the night lord voldemort tried to kill him when lily cast her own life between them as a shield the killing curse rebounded upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building part of lord voldemort lives inside harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with lord voldemorts mind that he has never understood and while that fragment of soul unmissed by voldemort remains attached to and protected by harry lord voldemort cannot die 
 
 harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voices echoing strangely in his ears 
 
 so the boythe boy must die asked snape quite calmly 
 
 and voldemort himself must do it severus that is essential 
 
 another long silence then snape said i thoughtall those yearsthat we were protecting him for her for lily 
 
 we have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength said dumbledore his eyes still tight shut meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth sometimes i have thought he suspects it himself if i know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of voldemort 
 
 dumbledore opened his eyes snape looked horrified 
 
 you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment 
 
 dont be shocked severus how many men and women have you watched die 
 
 lately only those whom i could not save said snape he stood up you have used me 
 
 meaning 
 
 i have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you everything was supposed to be to keep lily potters son safe now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter c 
 
 but this is touching severus said dumbledore seriously have you grown to care for the boy after all 
 
 for him shouted snape expecto patronum 
 
 from the tip of his wand burst the silver doe she landed on the office floor bounded once across the office and soared out of the window dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape and his eyes were full of tears 
 
 after all this time 
 
 always said snape 
 
 and the scene shifted now harry saw snape talking to the portrait of dumbledore behind his desk 
 
 you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harrys departure from his aunt and uncles said dumbledore not to do so will raise suspicion when voldemort believes you so well informed however you must plant the idea of decoys that i think ought to ensure harrys safety try confunding mundungus fletcher and severus if you are forced to take part in the chase be sure to act your part convincinglyi am counting upon you to remain in lord voldemorts good books as long as possible or hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the carrows 
 
 now snape was head to head with mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern mundunguss face looking curiously blank snape frowning in concentration 
 
 you will suggest to the order of the phoenix snape murmured that they use decoys polyjuice potion identical potters its the only thing that might work you will forget that i have suggested this you will present it as your own idea you understand 
 
 i understand murmured mundungus his eyes unfocused 
 
 now harry was flying alongside snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night he was accompanied by other hodded death eaters and ahead were lupin and a harry who was really george a death eater moved ahead of snape and raised his wand pointing it directly at lupins back 
 
 sectumsempra shouted snape 
 
 but the spell intended for the death eaters wand hand missed and hit george instead c 
 
 and next snape was kneeling in siriuss old bedroom tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from lily the second page carried only a few words could ever have been friends with gellert grindelwald i think her minds going personally 
 
 lots of love lily 
 
 snape took the page bearing lilys signature and her love and tucked it inside his robes then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding so that he kept the part from which lily laughed throwing the portion showing james and harry back onto the floor under the chest of drawers 
 
 and now snape stood again in the headmasters study as phineas nigellus came hurrying into his portrait 
 
 headmaster they are camping in the forest of dean the mudblood c 
 
 do not use that word 
 
 c the granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and i heard her 
 
 good very good cried the portrait of dumbledore behind the headmasters chair now severus the sword do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor c and he must not know that you give it if voldemort should read harrys mind and see you acting for him c 
 
 i know said snape curtly he approached the portrait of dumbledore and pulled at its side it swung forward revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of gryffindor 
 
 and you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give potter the sword said snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes 
 
 no i dont think so said dumbledores portrait he will know what to do with it and severus be very careful they may not take kindly to your appearance after george weasleys mishap c 
 
 snape turned at the door 
 
 dont worry dumbledore he said coolly i have a plan 
 
 and snape left the room harry rose up out of the pensieve and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same rooms snape might just have closed the door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bell 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the narrow streets of a large town people often heard in the 
 evening when the sun was setting and his last rays gave a golden 
 tint to the a strange noise which resembled the sound of a church bell it only lasted an instant for it was lost in the 
 continual roar of traffic and hum of voices which rose from the 
 town the evening bell is ringing people used to say the sun is 
 setting those who walked outside the town where the houses were 
 less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little fields saw the 
 evening sky much better and heard the sound of the bell much more 
 clearly it seemed as though the sound came from a church deep in the calm fragrant wood and thither people looked with devout feelings 
 
 a considerable time elapsed one said to the other i really 
 wonder if there is a church out in the wood the bell has indeed a 
 strange sweet sound shall we go there and see what the cause of it 
 is the rich drove the poor walked but the way seemed to them 
 extraordinarily long and when they arrived at a number of willow 
 trees on the border of the wood they sat down looked up into the 
 great branches and thought they were now really in the wood a 
 confectioner from the town also came out and put up a stall there 
 then came another confectioner who hung a bell over his stall which 
 was covered with pitch to protect it from the rain but the clapper 
 was wanting 
 
 when people came home they used to say that it had been very 
 romantic and that really means something else than merely taking tea 
 three persons declared that they had gone as far as the end of the 
 wood they had always heard the strange sound but there it seemed 
 to them as if it came from the town one of them wrote verses about 
 the bell and said that it was like the voice of a mother speaking 
 to an intelligent and beloved child no tune he said was sweeter 
 than the sound of the bell 
 
 the emperor of the country heard of it and declared that he who 
 would really find out where the sound came from should receive the 
 title of bellringer to the world even if there was no bell at all 
 now many went out into the wood for the sake of this splendid 
 berth but only one of them came back with some sort of explanation 
 none of them had gone far enough nor had he and yet he said that the sound of the bell came from a large owl in a hollow tree it was a 
 wisdom owl which continually knocked its head against the tree but 
 he was unable to say with certainty whether its head or the hollow 
 trunk of the tree was the cause of the noise 
 
 he was appointed bellringer to the world and wrote every year a 
 short dissertation on the owl but by this means people did not become any wiser than they had been before 
 
 it was just the clergyman had delivered a 
 beautiful and touching sermon the candidates were deeply moved by it it was indeed a very important day for them they were all at once 
 transformed from mere children to people the childish soul 
 was to fly over as it were into a more reasonable being 
 
 the sun shone most brightly and the sound of the great unknown 
 bell was heard more distinctly than ever they had a mind to go 
 thither all except three one of them wished to go home and try on 
 her ball dress for this very dress and the ball were the cause of her 
 being confirmed this time otherwise she would not have been allowed 
 to go the second a poor boy had borrowed a coat and a pair of boots from the son of his landlord to be confirmed in and he had to 
 return them at a certain time the third said that he never went 
 into strange places if his parents were not with him he had always 
 been a good child and wished to remain so even after being 
 confirmed and they ought not to tease him for this they however 
 did it all the same these three therefore did not go the others 
 went on the sun was shining the birds were singing and the 
 confirmed children sang too holding each other by the hand for 
 they had no position yet and they were all equal in the eyes of 
 god two of the smallest soon became tired and returned to the town two little girls sat down and made garlands of flowers they 
 therefore did not go on when the others arrived at the willow trees 
 where the confectioner had put up his stall they said now we are 
 out here the bell does not in reality exist it is only something 
 that people imagine 
 
 then suddenly the sound of the bell was heard so beautifully and 
 solemnly from the wood that four or five made up their minds to go 
 still further on the wood was very thickly grown it was difficult to 
 advance wood lilies and anemones grew almost too high flowering 
 convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to 
 tree while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played 
 that was very beautiful but the way was unfit for the girls they 
 would have torn their dresses large rocks covered with moss of 
 various hues were lying about the fresh spring water rippled forth 
 with a peculiar sound i think that can be the bell said 
 one of the confirmed children and then he lay down and listened 
 we must try to find out if it is and there he remained and let the 
 others walk on 
 
 they came to a hut built of the bark of trees and branches a 
 large tree spread its branches over it as if it intended 
 to pour all its fruit on the roof upon which roses were blooming the 
 long boughs covered the gable where a little bell was hanging was 
 this the one they had heard all agreed that it must be so except one 
 who said that the bell was too small and too thin to be heard at 
 such a distance and that it had quite a different sound to that which 
 had so touched hearts 
 
 he who spoke was a son and therefore the others said 
 that such a one always wishes to be cleverer than other people 
 therefore they let him go alone and as he walked on the solitude 
 of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast but still 
 he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced and 
 sometimes when the wind blew in that direction he could hear the 
 sounds from the stall where the others were singing at 
 tea but the deep sounds of the bell were much stronger soon it 
 seemed to him as if an organ played an accompaniment the sound came from the left from the side where the heart is now something rustled among the bushes and a little boy stood before the son in wooden shoes and such a short jacket that the sleeves did not reach to his wrists they knew each other the boy was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to take the coat and boots back to his son that he had done and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes for the sound of the bell was too enticing he felt he must go on 
 
 we might go together said the son but the poor boy with 
 the wooden shoes was quite ashamed he pulled at the short sleeves 
 of his jacket and said that he was afraid he could not walk so 
 fast besides he was of opinion that the bell ought to be sought at 
 the right for there was all that was grand and magnificent 
 
 then we shall not meet said the son nodding to the poor 
 boy who went into the deepest part of the wood where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands face and feet until 
 they bled the son also received several good scratches but 
 the sun was shining on his way and it is he whom we will now 
 follow for he was a quick fellow i will and must find the bell he 
 said if i have to go to the end of the world 
 
 ugly monkeys sat high in the branches and clenched their teeth 
 shall we beat him they said shall we thrash him he is a 
 son 
 
 but he walked on undaunted deeper and deeper into the wood where 
 the most wonderful flowers were growing there were standing white 
 star lilies with stamens tulips shining when the 
 wind moved them covered with apples like large glittering 
 soap bubbles only think how resplendent these trees were in the 
 sunshine all around were beautiful green meadows where hart and hind played in the grass there grew magnificent oaks and and if the bark was split of any of them long blades of grass grew out of the clefts there were also large smooth lakes in the wood 
 on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings 
 the son often stood still and listened sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes but soon he found that this was a mistake and that the bell was 
 ringing still farther in the wood then the sun set the clouds were 
 as red as fire it became quiet in the wood he sank down on his 
 knees sang an evening hymn and said i shall never find what i am 
 looking for now the sun is setting and the night the dark night is 
 approaching yet i may perhaps see the round sun once more before he disappears beneath the horizon i will climb up these rocks they 
 are as high as the highest trees and then taking hold of the 
 creepers and roots he climbed up on the wet stones where 
 were wriggling and the toads as it were barked at 
 him he reached the top before the sun seen from such a height had 
 quite set oh what a splendour the sea the great majestic sea 
 which was rolling its long waves against the shore stretched out 
 before him and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and 
 there where sea and heaven met all melted together in the most 
 glowing colours the wood was singing and his heart too the whole of nature was one large holy church in which the trees and hovering 
 clouds formed the pillars the flowers and grass the woven velvet 
 carpet and heaven itself was the great cupola up there the flame 
 colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared but millions of 
 stars were lighted diamond lamps were shining and the son 
 stretched his arms out towards heaven towards the sea and towards 
 the wood then suddenly the poor boy with the jacket and the wooden shoes appeared he had arrived just as quickly on the 
 road he had chosen and they ran towards each other and took one 
 hand in the great cathedral of nature and poesy and 
 above them sounded the invisible holy bell happy spirits surrounded 
 them singing hallelujahs and rejoicing

 book but the soul 
 chapter ix 
 
 marius produces on some one who is a judge of the matter the effect of being dead 
 he allowed marius to slide down upon the shore 
 they were in the open air 
 the miasmas darkness horror lay behind him 
 the pure healthful living joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him everywhere around him reigned silence but that charming silence when the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky 
 twilight had descended night was drawing on the great deliverer the friend of all those who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish the sky presented itself in all directions like an enormous calm the river flowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss 
 the aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night in the elms of the was audible 
 a few stars daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith and visible to revery alone formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity 
 evening was unfolding over the head of jean valjean all the sweetness of the infinite 
 it was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose oneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to permit of recognition at close quarters 
 for several seconds jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by that august and caressing serenity such moments of oblivion do come to men suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch everything is eclipsed in the thoughts peace broods over the dreamer like night and beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is illuminated the soul becomes studded with stars jean valjean could not refrain from contemplating that vast clear shadow which rested over him thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal heavens then he bent down swiftly to marius as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him and dipping up water in the hollow of his hand he gently sprinkled a few drops on the face marius eyelids did not open but his mouth still breathed 
 jean valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more when all at once he experienced an indescribable embarrassment such as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does not see 
 we have already alluded to this impression with which everyone is familiar 
 he turned round 
 some one was in fact behind him as there had been a short while before 
 a man of lofty stature enveloped in a long coat with folded arms and bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was visible stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where jean valjean was crouching over marius 
 with the aid of the darkness it seemed a sort of apparition an ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight a thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon 
 jean valjean recognized javert 
 the reader has divined no doubt that pursuer was no other than javert 
 javert after his escape from the barricade had betaken himself to the prefecture of police had rendered a verbal account to the prefect in person in a brief audience had then immediately gone on duty again which implied the note the reader will recollect which had been captured on his certain surveillance of the shore on the right bank of the seine near the which had for some time past aroused the attention of the police 
 there he had caught sight of thenardier and had followed him 
 the reader knows the rest 
 thus it will be easily understood that that grating so obligingly opened to jean valjean was a bit of cleverness on part thenardier intuitively felt that javert was still there the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him it was necessary to fling a bone to that an assassin what a godsend 
 such an opportunity must never be allowed to slip 
 thenardier by putting jean valjean outside in his stead provided a prey for the police forced them to relinquish his scent made them forget him in a bigger adventure repaid javert for his waiting which always flatters a spy earned thirty francs and counted with certainty so far as he himself was concerned on escaping with the aid of this diversion 
 jean valjean had fallen from one danger upon another 
 these two encounters this falling one after the other from thenardier upon javert was a rude shock 
 javert did not recognize jean valjean who as we have stated no longer looked like himself 
 he did not unfold his arms he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist by an imperceptible movement and said in a curt calm voice 
 who are you 
 i 
 who is i 
 jean valjean 
 javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth bent his knees inclined his body laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of jean valjean which were clamped within them as in a couple of vices scrutinized him and recognized him 
 their faces almost touched look was terrible 
 jean valjean remained inert beneath grasp like a lion submitting to the claws of a lynx 
 inspector javert said he you have me in your power 
 moreover i have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning i did not give you my address with any intention of escaping from you take me 
 only grant me one favor 
 javert did not appear to hear him 
 he kept his eyes riveted on jean valjean 
 his chin being contracted thrust his lips upwards towards his nose a sign of savage revery 
 at length he released jean valjean straightened himself stiffly up without bending grasped his bludgeon again firmly and as though in a dream he murmured rather than uttered this question 
 what are you doing here 
 and who is this man 
 he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou 
 jean valjean replied and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse javert 
 it is with regard to him that i desire to speak to you dispose of me as you see fit but first help me to carry him home that is all that i ask of you 
 face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed to think him capable of making a concession 
 nevertheless he did not say no 
 again he bent over drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he moistened in the water and with which he then wiped marius brow 
 this man was at the barricade said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself 
 he is the one they called marius 
 a spy of the first quality who had observed everything listened to everything and taken in everything even when he thought that he was to die who had played the spy even in his agony and who with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre had taken notes 
 he seized marius hand and felt his pulse 
 he is wounded said jean valjean 
 he is a dead man said javert 
 jean valjean replied 
 no not yet 
 so you have brought him thither from the barricade remarked javert 
 his preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer and for him not to even notice jean silence after his question 
 jean valjean on his side seemed to have but one thought he resumed 
 he lives in the marais rue des with his grandfather 
 i do not recollect his name 
 jean valjean fumbled in marius coat pulled out his opened it at the page which marius had pencilled and held it out to javert 
 there was still sufficient light to admit of reading 
 besides this javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds he deciphered the few lines written by marius and muttered gillenormand rue des no 
 then he exclaimed 
 coachman 
 the reader will remember that the was waiting in case of need 
 javert kept marius 
 a moment later the carriage which had descended by the inclined plane of the was on the shore 
 marius was laid upon the back seat and javert seated himself on the front seat beside jean valjean 
 the door slammed and the carriage drove rapidly away ascending the quays in the direction of the bastille 
 they quitted the quays and entered the streets 
 the coachman a black form on his box whipped up his thin horses 
 a glacial silence reigned in the carriage 
 marius motionless with his body resting in the corner and his head drooping on his breast his arms hanging his legs stiff seemed to be awaiting only a coffin jean valjean seemed made of shadow and javert of stone and in that vehicle full of night whose interior every time that it passed in front of a street lantern appeared to be turned lividly wan as by an intermittent flash of lightning chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility the corpse the spectre and the statue

 first epilogue 
 chapter iii 
 
 the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to moscow it was necessary that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east that they should abandon all established traditions and customs and that during their military movement they should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committed during that movement 
 and beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately large group was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done 
 a man without convictions without habits without traditions without a name and not even a frenchman emerges by what seem the strangest chances from among all the seething french parties and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position 
 the ignorance of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance of his opponents the frankness of his falsehoods and the dazzling and limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy his opponents reluctance to fight and his own childish audacity and secure him military fame innumerable so called chances accompany him everywhere the disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of france turns to his advantage his attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the russian service and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing during the war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner owing to various diplomatic considerations the russian armies just those which might have destroyed his prestige do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there 
 on his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed and by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to africa again chance accompanies him impregnable malta surrenders without a shot his most reckless schemes are crowned with success the fleet which subsequently did not let a single boat pass allows his entire army to elude it in africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants and the men who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselves that this is admirable this is glory it resembles caesar and alexander the great and is therefore good 
 this ideal of glory and grandeur which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significance that ideal destined to guide this man and his associates had scope for its development in africa whatever he does succeeds the plague does not touch him the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault his childishly rash and ignoble departure from africa leaving his comrades in distress is set down to his credit and again the fleet twice lets him slip past when intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully he reaches paris the dissolution of the republican government which a year earlier might have ruined him has reached its extreme limit and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him and though he himself has no plan he is quite ready for his new role 
 he had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation 
 he alone with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and egypt his insane his boldness in crime and frankness in lying he alone could justify what had to be done 
 he is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all his mistakes he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success 
 he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes to flee considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him but the once proud and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out are even more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power 
 chance millions of chances give him power and all men as if by agreement to confirm that power chance forms the characters of the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the character of paul i of russia who recognizes his government chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power chance puts the duc in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right since he had the might chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against england which would inevitably have ruined him he never carries out that intention but unexpectedly falls upon mack and the austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius give him the victory at austerlitz and by chance all men not only the french but all europe except england which does not take part in the events about to happen despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes now recognize his authority the title he has given himself and his ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent and reasonable to them all 
 as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement the western forces push toward the east several times in and gaining strength and growing in the group of people that had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central europe the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group during the preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him the king of prussia sends his wife to seek the great mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter the caesars into his bed the pope the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen there is no step no crime or petty fraud he commits which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed the most suitable fete the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt not only is he great but so are his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part and when he is ready so too are the forces 
 the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow that city is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire and the frosts and instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident 
 the invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him 
 a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of and precede the great westward movement there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesion of the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitation midway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached 
 paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chance occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and his craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later an outlawed brigand but by some strange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him

 return of the son who was prodigal of his life 
 at every jolt over the pavement a drop of blood trickled from marius hair 
 night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at no rue des 
 javert was the first to alight he made sure with one glance of the number on the carriage gate and raising the heavy knocker of beaten iron embellished in the old style with a male goat and a satyr confronting each other he gave a violent peal the gate opened a little way and javert gave it a push 
 the porter half made his appearance yawning vaguely awake and with a candle in his hand 
 everyone in the house was asleep 
 people go to bed betimes in the marais especially on days when there is a revolt 
 this good old quarter terrified at the revolution takes refuge in slumber as children when they hear the bugaboo coming hide their heads hastily under their coverlet 
 in the meantime jean valjean and the coachman had taken marius out of the carriage jean valjean supporting him under the armpits and the coachman under the knees 
 as they thus bore marius jean valjean slipped his hand under the clothes which were broadly rent felt his breast and assured himself that his heart was still beating 
 it was even beating a little less feebly as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a certain fresh access of life 
 javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government and the presence of the porter of a factious person 
 some person whose name is gillenormand 
 here 
 what do you want with him 
 his son is brought back 
 his son said the porter stupidly 
 he is dead 
 jean valjean who soiled and tattered stood behind javert and whom the porter was surveying with some horror made a sign to him with his head that this was not so 
 the porter did not appear to understand either words or jean sign 
 javert continued 
 he went to the barricade and here he is 
 to the barricade ejaculated the porter 
 he has got himself killed 
 go waken his father 
 the porter did not stir 
 go along with you repeated javert 
 and he added 
 there will be a funeral here 
 for javert the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically classed which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance and each contingency had its own compartment all possible facts were arranged in drawers as it were whence they emerged on occasion in variable quantities in the street uproar revolt carnival and funeral 
 the porter contented himself with waking basque 
 basque woke nicolette nicolette roused gillenormand 
 as for the grandfather they let him sleep on thinking that he would hear about the matter early enough in any case 
 marius was carried up to the first floor without any one in the other parts of the house being aware of the fact and deposited on an old sofa in m antechamber and while basque went in search of a physician and while nicolette opened the jean valjean felt javert touch him on the shoulder he understood and descended the stairs having behind him the step of javert who was following him 
 the porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their arrival in terrified somnolence 
 they entered the carriage once more and the coachman mounted his box 
 inspector javert said jean grant me yet another favor 
 what is it demanded javert roughly 
 let me go home for one instant 
 then you shall do whatever you like with me 
 javert remained silent for a few moments with his chin drawn back into the collar of his then he lowered the glass and front 
 driver said he rue de arme no

 first epilogue 
 chapter iv 
 
 the flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels the waves of the great movement abate and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate 
 but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed the diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces they anticipate war between their sovereigns the position seems to them insoluble but the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect it rises again from the same point as before paris the last backwash of the movement from the west occurs a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history 
 the man who had devastated france returns to france alone without any conspiracy and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later 
 this man is still needed to justify the final collective act 
 that act is performed 
 the last role is played the actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint he will not be wanted any more 
 and some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions 
 the manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us 
 see what you believed in this is he do you now see that it was not he but i who moved you 
 but dazed by the force of the movement it was long before people understood this 
 still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of alexander i the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from east to west 
 what was needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the head of that movement from east to west 
 what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european affairs but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who with him a mild and attractive personality and a personal grievance against napoleon and all this was found in alexander i all this had been prepared by innumerable chances in his life his education his early liberalism the advisers who surrounded him and by austerlitz and tilsit and erfurt 
 during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed but as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and uniting the nations of europe led them to the goal 
 the goal is reached after the final war of alexander possesses all possible power how does he use it 
 alexander i the pacifier of europe the man who from his early years had striven only for his welfare the originator of the liberal innovations in his fatherland now that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of his peoples at the time when napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power alexander i having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand of god upon him suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that supposed power turns away from it and gives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises saying only 
 not unto us not unto us but unto thy name i too am a man like the rest of you let me live like a man and think of my soul and of god 
 as the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man 
 a bee settling on a flower has stung a child and the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people a poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers a beekeeper seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive says that it exists to gather honey another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen and that it exists to perpetuate its race a botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter and sees in this the purpose of the existence another observing the migration of plants notices that the bee helps in this work and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee but the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first the second or any of the processes the human mind can discern the higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes the more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension 
 all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life and so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations

 concussion in the absolute 
 they did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride 
 what did jean valjean want 
 to finish what he had begun to warn cosette to tell her where marius was to give her possibly some other useful information to take if he could certain final measures as for himself so far as he was personally concerned all was over he had been seized by javert and had not resisted any other man than himself in like situation would perhaps have had some vague thoughts connected with the rope which thenardier had given him and of the bars of the first cell that he should enter but let us impress it upon the reader after the bishop there had existed in jean valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of any violence even when directed against himself 
 suicide that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may contain in a measure the death of the soul was impossible to jean valjean 
 at the entrance to the rue de arme the carriage halted the way being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles javert and jean valjean alighted 
 the coachman humbly represented to monsieur that the utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the assassinated man and with mire from the assassin 
 that is the way he understood it 
 he added that an indemnity was due him at the same time drawing his certificate book from his pocket he begged the inspector to have the goodness to write him a bit of an attestation 
 javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him and said 
 how much do you want including your time of waiting and the drive 
 it comes to seven hours and a quarter replied the man and my velvet was perfectly new 
 eighty francs mr inspector 
 javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage 
 jean valjean fancied that it was intention to conduct him on foot to the post of the or to the post of the archives both of which are close at hand 
 they entered the street 
 it was deserted as usual 
 javert followed jean valjean 
 they reached no 
 jean valjean knocked the door opened 
 it is well said javert 
 go up stairs 
 he added with a strange expression and as though he were exerting an effort in speaking in this manner 
 i will wait for you here 
 jean valjean looked at javert 
 this mode of procedure was but little in accord with habits 
 however he could not be greatly surprised that javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him the confidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of its claws seeing that jean valjean had made up his mind to surrender himself and to make an end of it he pushed open the door entered the house called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord from his couch 
 it is i and ascended the stairs 
 on arriving at the first floor he paused 
 all sorrowful roads have their stations 
 the window on the which was a was open 
 as in many ancient houses the staircase got its light from without and had a view on the street the situated directly opposite cast some light on the stairs and thus effected some economy in illumination 
 jean valjean either for the sake of getting the air or mechanically thrust his head out of this window 
 he leaned out over the street it is short and the lantern lighted it from end to end jean valjean was overwhelmed with amazement there was no longer any one there 
 javert had taken his departure

 first epilogue 
 chapter v 
 
 wedding to bezukhov which took place in was the last happy event in the family of the old rostovs count ilya rostov died that same year and as always happens after the death the family group broke up 
 the events of the previous year the burning of moscow and the flight from it the death of prince andrew despair death and the old countess grief fell blow after blow on the old head he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising 
 the arrangements for marriage occupied him for a while he ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him 
 when pierre and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression a few days later he fell ill and took to his bed he realized from the first that he would not get up again despite the encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand on his last day sobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property that being the chief fault of which he was conscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly died and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs all these acquaintances who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him now said with a common feeling of and emotion as if justifying themselves well whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man you meet such men nowadays and which of us has not weaknesses of his own 
 it was just when the affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died 
 nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his death reached him he at once resigned his commission and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to moscow the state of the affairs became quite obvious a month after his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected the debts amounted to double the value of the property 
 friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his memory which he held sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts 
 the creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the careless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed to pity the old man the cause of their losses if they were losses now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them 
 not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold by auction for half its value and half the debts still remained unpaid nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as the creditors threatened he the government service 
 he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life and so despite his reluctant to remain in moscow among people who had known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil service he accepted a post in moscow in that service doffed the uniform of which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sonya to a small house on the sivtsev vrazhek 
 natasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from his nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and sonya but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty the countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it was for her son kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep to send for a friend now some expensive article of food for herself or wine for her son or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha or sonya or for nicholas himself 
 sonya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with her whims and secret and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from her 
 he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and because there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that people are valued for but little that could have made him love her he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed 
 nicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream not only did he not save anything but to comply with his demands he even incurred some small debts he could see no way out of this situation the idea of marrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his female relations was repugnant to him the other way out his death never entered his head he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently up and down the room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position

 book but the soul 
 chapter xii 
 
 the grandfather 
 basque and the porter had carried marius into the as he still lay stretched out motionless on the sofa upon which he had been placed on his arrival 
 the doctor who had been sent for had hastened thither 
 aunt gillenormand had risen 
 aunt gillenormand went and came in affright wringing her hands and incapable of doing anything but saying 
 heavens is it possible at times she added 
 everything will be covered with blood when her first horror had passed off a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated her mind and took form in the exclamation it was bound to end in this way 
 she did not go so far as i told you so which is customary on this sort of occasion at the orders a camp bed had been prepared beside the sofa the doctor examined marius and after having found that his pulse was still beating that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils he had him placed flat on the bed without a pillow with his head on the same level as his body and even a trifle lower and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration mademoiselle gillenormand on perceiving that they were undressing marius withdrew 
 she set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber 
 the trunk had not suffered any internal injury a bullet deadened by the had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideous laceration which was of no great depth and consequently not dangerous 
 the long underground journey had completed the dislocation of the broken and the disorder there was serious 
 the arms had been slashed with sabre cuts not a single scar disfigured his face but his head was fairly covered with cuts what would be the result of these wounds on the head would they stop short at the hairy cuticle or would they attack the brain 
 as yet this could not be decided 
 a grave symptom was that they had caused a swoon and that people do not always recover from such swoons 
 moreover the wounded man had been exhausted by hemorrhage 
 from the waist down the barricade had protected the lower part of the body from injury 
 basque and nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages nicolette sewed them basque rolled them 
 as lint was lacking the doctor for the time being arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding beside the bed three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out 
 the doctor bathed marius face and hair with cold water 
 a full pail was reddened in an instant the porter candle in hand lighted them 
 the doctor seemed to be pondering sadly 
 from time to time he made a negative sign with his head as though replying to some question which he had inwardly addressed to himself 
 a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor with himself 
 at the moment when the doctor was wiping marius face and lightly touching his still closed eyes with his finger a door opened at the end of the and a long pallid figure made its appearance 
 this was the grandfather 
 the revolt had for the past two days deeply agitated enraged and engrossed the mind of m gillenormand 
 he had not been able to sleep on the previous night and he had been in a fever all day long in the evening he had gone to bed very early recommending that everything in the house should be well barred and he had fallen into a doze through sheer fatigue 
 old men sleep lightly m chamber adjoined the and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken the noise had awakened him 
 surprised at the rift of light which he saw under his door he had risen from his bed and had groped his way thither 
 he stood astonished on the threshold one hand on the handle of the door with his head bent a little forward and quivering his body wrapped in a white which was straight and as destitute of folds as a and he had the air of a phantom who is gazing into a tomb 
 he saw the bed and on the mattress that young man bleeding white with a waxen whiteness with closed eyes and gaping mouth and pallid lips stripped to the waist slashed all over with crimson wounds motionless and brilliantly lighted up 
 the grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbs can tremble his eyes whose corneae were yellow on account of his great age were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter his whole face assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull his arms fell pendent as though a spring had broken and his amazement was betrayed by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands which quivered all over his knees formed an angle in front allowing through the opening in his a view of his poor bare legs all bristling with white hairs and he murmured 
 marius 
 sir said basque monsieur has just been brought back he went to the barricade and 
 he is dead cried the old man in a terrible voice 
 ah 
 the rascal 
 then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this centenarian as erect as a young man 
 sir said he you are the doctor 
 begin by telling me one thing he is dead is he not 
 the doctor who was at the highest pitch of anxiety remained silent 
 m gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter 
 he is dead 
 he is dead 
 he is dead 
 he has got himself killed on the barricades 
 out of hatred to me 
 he did that to spite me 
 ah 
 you this is the way he returns to me misery of my life he is dead 
 he went to the window threw it wide open as though he were stifling and erect before the darkness he began to talk into the street to the night 
 pierced sabred exterminated slashed hacked in pieces 
 just look at that the villain 
 he knew well that i was waiting for him and that i had had his room arranged and that i had placed at the head of my bed his portrait taken when he was a little child he knew well that he had only to come back and that i had been recalling him for years and that i remained by my fireside with my hands on my knees not knowing what to do and that i was mad over it 
 you knew well that you had but to return and to say it is i and you would have been the master of the house and that i should have obeyed you and that you could have done whatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather you knew that well and you said 
 no he is a royalist i will not go 
 and you went to the barricades and you got yourself killed out of malice 
 to revenge yourself for what i said to you about monsieur le duc de berry it is infamous 
 go to bed then and sleep tranquilly he is dead and this is my awakening 
 the doctor who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters quitted marius for a moment went to m gillenormand and took his arm the grandfather turned round gazed at him with eyes which seemed exaggerated in size and bloodshot and said to him calmly 
 i thank you sir 
 i am composed i am a man i witnessed the death of louis xvi i know how to bear events 
 one thing is terrible and that is to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief you will have scribblers chatterers lawyers orators tribunes discussions progress enlightenment the rights of man the liberty of the press and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you 
 ah 
 marius 
 it is abominable 
 killed 
 dead before me a barricade 
 ah the scamp 
 doctor you live in this quarter i believe 
 oh 
 i know you well 
 i see your cabriolet pass my window 
 i am going to tell you 
 you are wrong to think that i am angry 
 one does not fly into a rage against a dead man that would be stupid 
 this is a child whom i have reared i was already old while he was very young 
 he played in the tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair and in order that the inspectors might not grumble i stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel with my cane one day he exclaimed 
 down with louis xviii and off he went it was no fault of mine 
 he was all rosy and blond 
 his mother is dead 
 have you ever noticed that all little children are blond why is it so 
 he is the son of one of those brigands of the loire but children are innocent of their fathers crimes 
 i remember when he was no higher than that 
 he could not manage to pronounce his ds he had a way of talking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping 
 i remember that once in front of the hercules farnese people formed a circle to admire him and marvel at him he was so handsome was that child he had a head such as you see in pictures 
 i talked in a deep voice and i frightened him with my cane but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh 
 in the morning when he entered my room i grumbled but he was like the sunlight to me all the same one cannot defend oneself against those brats 
 they take hold of you they hold you fast they never let you go again 
 the truth is that there never was a cupid like that child 
 now what can you say for your lafayettes your benjamin constants and your tirecuir de corcelles who have killed him 
 this cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion 
 he approached marius who still lay livid and motionless and to whom the physician had returned and began once more to wring his hands 
 the old pallid lips moved as though mechanically and permitted the passage of words that were barely audible like breaths in the death agony 
 ah heartless lad 
 ah clubbist 
 ah wretch 
 ah 
 septembrist 
 reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man addressed to a corpse 
 little by little as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions should come to the light the sequence of words returned but the grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them his voice was so weak and extinct that it seemed to come from the other side of an abyss 
 it is all the same to me i am going to die too that i am and to think that there is not a hussy in paris who would not have been delighted to make this wretch happy 
 a scamp who instead of amusing himself and enjoying life went off to fight and get himself shot down like a brute 
 and for whom 
 why 
 for the republic instead of going to dance at the chaumiere as it is the duty of young folks to do 
 the use of being twenty years old 
 the republic a cursed pretty folly 
 poor mothers beget fine boys do 
 come he is dead 
 that will make two funerals under the same carriage gate so you have got yourself arranged like this for the sake of general handsome eyes 
 what had that general lamarque done to you a slasher 
 a to get oneself killed for a dead man if that enough to drive any one mad 
 just think of it at twenty 
 and without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him 
 the way poor good old fellows are forced to die alone perish in your corner owl 
 well after all so much the better that is what i was hoping for this will kill me on the spot 
 i am too old i am a hundred years old i am a hundred thousand years old i ought by rights to have been dead long ago 
 this blow puts an end to it so all is over what happiness 
 what is the good of making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs 
 you are wasting your trouble you fool of a doctor 
 come dead completely dead i know all about it i am dead myself too 
 he done things by half 
 yes this age is infamous infamous and what i think of you of your ideas of your systems of your masters of your oracles of your doctors of your of writers of your rascally philosophers and of all the revolutions which for the last sixty years have been frightening the flocks of crows in the tuileries 
 but you were pitiless in getting yourself killed like this i shall not even grieve over your death do you understand you assassin 
 at that moment marius slowly opened his eyes and his glance still dimmed by lethargic wonder rested on m gillenormand 
 marius cried the old man 
 marius 
 my little marius my child my son 
 you open your eyes you gaze upon me you are alive thanks 
 and he fell fainting

 first epilogue 
 chapter vi 
 
 at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated and how the son has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were saying 
 i never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herself feeling a joyous sense of her love for him remembering her friendly relations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of the family she thought it her duty to go to see them but remembering her relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in moscow 
 nicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only be reached through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiff proud expression she had not seen on it before he inquired about her health led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutes left the room 
 when the princess came out of the countess room nicholas met her again and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom to her remarks about his health he made no reply that to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to say 
 why does she come prowling here what does she want i bear these ladies and all these civilities said he aloud in presence evidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriage had disappeared 
 oh nicholas how can you talk like that cried sonya hardly able to conceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her 
 nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day 
 she sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expressed a wish to see her often but yet always became when she began to talk about her 
 nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess but his silence irritated her 
 she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and you must go and call on her you would at least be seeing somebody and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us 
 but i in the least want to mamma 
 you used to want to and now you really i understand you my dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see anyone 
 but i never said i was dull 
 why you said yourself you want even to see her she is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head you hide everything from me 
 not at all mamma 
 if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only ask you to return a call one would think mere politeness required it well i have asked you and now i interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother 
 well then go if you wish it 
 it matter to me i only wish it for your sake 
 nicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for a patience trying to divert his attention to another topic 
 the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and the day after that 
 after her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by nicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call 
 i expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to her aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations 
 but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and when she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was her relation to rostov his cold polite manner did not express his feeling for her she knew that but it concealed something and until she could discover what that something was she felt that she could not be at ease 
 one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her lessons she was informed that rostov had called with a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sent for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room 
 her first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her 
 they spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of the latest war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise nicholas got up to say 
 with mademoiselle help the princess had maintained the conversation very well but at the very last moment just when he rose she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life that in a fit of she sat still her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that he had risen 
 nicholas glanced at her and wishing to appear not to notice her abstraction made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then again looked at the princess she still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face he suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed he wished to help her and say something pleasant but could think of nothing to say 
 princess said he 
 she started flushed and sighed deeply 
 oh i beg your pardon she said as if waking up are you going already count well then oh but the cushion for the countess 
 wait a moment fetch it said mademoiselle bourienne and she left the room 
 they both sat silent with an occasional glance at one another 
 yes princess said nicholas at last with a sad smile it seem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo but how much water has flowed since then in what distress we all seemed to be then yet i would give much to bring back that time but no bringing it back 
 princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her 
 yes yes said she but you have no reason to regret the past count as i understand your present life i think you will always recall it with satisfaction because the that fills it now 
 i cannot accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly on the contrary i continually reproach myself but this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject 
 his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression but the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved and it was to him that she now spoke 
 i thought you would allow me to tell you this she said i had come so near to you and to all your family that i thought you would not consider my sympathy misplaced but i was mistaken and suddenly her voice trembled i know why she continued recovering herself but you used to be different and 
 there are a thousand reasons why laying special emphasis on the why thank you princess he added softly sometimes it is hard 
 so why why a voice whispered in princess soul no it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only that handsome exterior that i loved in him i divined his noble resolute spirit too she said to herself yes he is poor now and i am rich yes the only reason yes were it not for that and remembering his former tenderness and looking now at his kind sorrowful face she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness 
 but why count why she almost cried unconsciously moving closer to him why tell me you must tell me 
 he was silent 
 i understand your why count she continued but hard for me i confess it for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former friendship and that hurts me there were tears in her eyes and in her voice i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to bear excuse me and suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room 
 princess for sake he exclaimed trying to stop her princess 
 she turned round for a few seconds they gazed silently into one eyes and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became possible inevitable and very near

 book derailed 
 chapter i 
 
 javert passed slowly down the rue de arme 
 he walked with drooping head for the first time in his life and likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his back 
 up to that day javert had borrowed from attitudes only that which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest that which is expressive of the hands behind the been unknown to him 
 now a change had taken place his whole person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety 
 he plunged into the silent streets 
 nevertheless he followed one given direction 
 he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quai des ormes skirted the quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from the post of the place du chatelet at the angle of the pont there between the and the pont au change on the one hand and the quai de la megisserie and the quai aux fleurs on the other the seine forms a sort of square lake traversed by a rapid 
 this point of the seine is dreaded by mariners 
 nothing is more dangerous than this rapid hemmed in at that epoch and irritated by the piles of the mill on the bridge now demolished the two bridges situated thus close together augment the peril the water hurries in formidable wise through the arches 
 it rolls in vast and terrible waves it accumulates and piles up there the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes 
 men who fall in there never the best of swimmers are drowned there 
 javert leaned both elbows on the parapet his chin resting in both hands and while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of his whiskers he meditated 
 a novelty a revolution a catastrophe had just taken place in the depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself 
 javert was undergoing horrible suffering 
 for several hours javert had ceased to be simple 
 he was troubled that brain so limpid in its blindness had lost its transparency that crystal was clouded 
 javert felt duty divided within his conscience and he could not conceal the fact from himself 
 when he had so unexpectedly encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine there had been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey and of the dog who finds his master again 
 he beheld before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known more than one straight line 
 and the poignant anguish lay in this that the two paths were contrary to each other one of these straight lines excluded the other 
 which of the two was the true one 
 his situation was indescribable 
 to owe his life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repay it to be in spite of himself on a level with a fugitive from justice and to repay his service with another service to allow it to be said to him go and to say to the latter in his turn 
 be free to sacrifice to personal motives duty that general obligation and to be conscious in those personal motives of something that was also general and perchance superior to betray society in order to remain true to his conscience that all these absurdities should be realized and should accumulate upon was what overwhelmed him 
 one thing had amazed was that jean valjean should have done him a favor and one thing petrified him that he javert should have done jean valjean a favor 
 where did he stand 
 he sought to comprehend his position and could no longer find his bearings 
 what was he to do now 
 to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean valjean at liberty was bad 
 in the first case the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys in the second a convict rose above the law and set his foot upon it 
 in both cases dishonor for him javert 
 there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive 
 destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice javert had reached one of those extremities 
 one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think the very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it thought was something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful 
 in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion and it irritated him to have that within him 
 thought on any subject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue thought on the day which had just passed was a torture 
 nevertheless it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after such shocks and render to himself an account of himself 
 what he had just done made him shudder 
 he javert had seen fit to decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the whole social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code upon a release this had suited him he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable every time that he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which he had committed he trembled from head to foot upon what should he decide 
 one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to the rue de arme and commit jean valjean to prison 
 it was clear that that was what he ought to do he could not 
 something barred his way in that direction 
 something 
 what 
 is there in the world anything outside of the tribunals executory sentences the police and the authorities javert was overwhelmed 
 a sacred 
 a convict who could not be touched by the law and that the deed of javert 
 was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the man made to proceed with vigor the man made to these two men who were both the things of the law should have come to such a pass that both of them had set themselves above the law 
 what then such enormities were to happen and no one was to be punished 
 jean valjean stronger than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he javert was to go on eating the bread 
 his revery gradually became terrible 
 he might athwart this revery have also reproached himself on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue des but he never even thought of that the lesser fault was lost in the greater 
 besides that insurgent was obviously a dead man and legally death puts an end to pursuit 
 jean valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit 
 jean valjean disconcerted him 
 all the axioms which had served him as points of support all his life long had crumbled away in the presence of this man 
 jean generosity towards him javert crushed him 
 other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities 
 m madeleine behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed in such fashion that they now formed but one which was venerable 
 javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his for a convict respect for a that a possible thing 
 he shuddered at it yet could not escape from it 
 in vain did he struggle he was reduced to confess in his inmost heart the sublimity of that wretch 
 this was odious 
 a benevolent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement a convict returning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy saving him who had smitten him kneeling on the heights of virtue more nearly akin to an angel than to a man javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed 
 things could not go on in this manner 
 certainly and we insist upon this point he had not yielded without resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous hero who enraged almost as much as he amazed him twenty times as he sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had roared within him 
 a score of times he had been tempted to fling himself upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to arrest him 
 what more simple in fact 
 to cry out at the first post that they is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban to summon the gendarmes and say to them 
 this man is yours then to go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter 
 this man is forever a prisoner of the law the law may do with him what it will 
 what could be more just javert had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to apprehend the man and then as at present he had not been able to do it and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towards jean collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice a strange voice crying to is well deliver up your savior 
 then have the basin of pontius pilate brought and wash your claws 
 then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he beheld himself javert degraded 
 a convict was his benefactor 
 but then why had he permitted that man to leave him alive he had the right to be killed in that barricade 
 he should have asserted that right 
 it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force 
 his supreme anguish was the loss of certainty 
 he felt that he had been uprooted 
 the code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand 
 he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species there had taken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto 
 to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice a whole order of unexpected facts had cropped up and subjugated him a whole new world was dawning on his soul 
 kindness accepted and repaid devotion mercy indulgence violences committed by pity on austerity respect for persons no more definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a tear in the eye of the law no one knows what justice according to god running in inverse sense to justice according to men 
 he perceived amid the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun it horrified and dazzled him an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle 
 he said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled obedience that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue of the functionary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified against a surprise 
 he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist 
 this convict had been good 
 and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been good also 
 so he was becoming depraved 
 he found that he was a coward 
 he conceived a horror of himself 
 ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was to be irreproachable 
 now he had just failed in this 
 how had he come to such a pass 
 how had all this happened he could not have told himself 
 he clasped his head in both hands but in spite of all that he could do he could not contrive to explain it to himself 
 he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which he javert was the slave 
 not for a single instant while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of releasing him 
 it was in some sort without his consciousness that his hand had relaxed and had let him go free 
 all sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes 
 he put questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies frightened him 
 he asked himself 
 what has that convict done that desperate fellow whom i have pursued even to persecution and who has had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me my life in showing mercy upon me 
 his duty 
 no something more and i in showing mercy upon him in my have i done my duty 
 no something more 
 so there is something beyond duty here he took fright his balance became disjointed one of the scales fell into the abyss the other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below 
 without being in the least in the world what is called voltairian or a philosopher or incredulous being on the contrary respectful by instinct towards the established church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole order was his dogma and sufficed for him ever since he had attained to estate and the rank of a functionary he had centred nearly all his religion in the police 
 here we employ words without the least irony and in their most serious acceptation being as we have said a spy as other men are priests 
 he had a superior m gisquet up to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior god 
 this new chief god he became unexpectedly conscious of and he felt embarrassed by him 
 this unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings he did not know what to do with this superior he who was not ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow that he must not disobey nor find fault nor discuss and that in the presence of a superior who amazes him too greatly the inferior has no other resource than that of handing in his resignation 
 but how was he to set about handing in his resignation to god 
 however things might it was to this point that he reverted fact dominated everything else for him and that was that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law 
 he had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban 
 he had just set a at large he had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them that was what he had done 
 he no longer understood himself the very reasons for his action escaped him only their vertigo was left with him 
 up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity engenders 
 this faith had quitted him this probity had deserted him 
 all that he had believed in melted away 
 truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably 
 henceforth he must be a different man he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract 
 he saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold 
 he felt himself emptied useless put out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved 
 authority was dead within him 
 he had no longer any reason for existing 
 a terrible situation to be touched 
 to be granite and to doubt to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart to come to the pass of returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil to be the and to lick the hand to be ice and melt to be the pincers and to turn into a hand to suddenly feel fingers opening to relax a terrible thing 
 the no longer acquainted with his route and retreating 
 to be obliged to confess this to oneself 
 infallibility is not infallible there may exist error in the dogma all has not been said when a code speaks society is not perfect authority is complicated with vacillation a crack is possible in the immutable judges are but men the law may err tribunals may make a mistake to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament 
 that which was passing in javert was the fampoux of a rectilinear conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probity which had been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking against god 
 it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that the engineer of authority mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light that the immovable the direct the correct the geometrical the passive the perfect could bend that there should exist for the locomotive a road to damascus 
 god always within man and refractory he the true conscience to the false a prohibition to the spark to die out an order to the ray to remember the sun an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute humanity which cannot be lost the human heart indestructible that splendid phenomenon the finest perhaps of all our interior marvels did javert understand this 
 did javert penetrate it did javert account for it to himself 
 evidently he did not but beneath the pressure of that incontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting 
 he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy in all this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence it seemed to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever he was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head 
 up to this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing incomprehensible nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided for authority was a plane surface there was no fall in it no dizziness in its presence 
 javert had never beheld the unknown except from below 
 the irregular the unforeseen the disordered opening of chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches 
 now javert threw himself back and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition 
 a gulf on high 
 what one was dismantled from top to bottom one was disconcerted absolutely 
 in what could one trust 
 that which had been agreed upon was giving way 
 what the defect in armor could be discovered by a magnanimous wretch 
 what an honest servitor of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to escape and the crime of arresting him everything was not settled in the orders given by the state to the functionary 
 there might be blind alleys in duty 
 what all this was real was it true that an weighed down with convictions could rise erect and end by being in the right was this credible were there cases in which the law should retire before transfigured crime and stammer its that was the state of the case and javert saw it and javert had touched it and not only could he not deny it but he had taken part in it these were realities 
 it was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity 
 if facts did their duty they would confine themselves to being proofs of the law is god who sends them was anarchy then on the point of now descending from on high 
 in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced and society and the human race and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and terrible the penal laws the thing judged the force due to legislation the decrees of the sovereign courts the magistracy the government prevention repression official cruelty wisdom legal infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all this was rubbish a shapeless mass chaos he himself javert the spy of order incorruptibility in the service of the police the providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect at the summit of all that ruin a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had come this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul 
 was this to be endured 
 no 
 a violent state if ever such existed 
 there were only two ways of escaping from it 
 one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys 
 the other 
 javert quitted the parapet and with head erect this time betook himself with a firm tread towards the indicated by a lantern at one of the corners of the place du chatelet 
 on arriving there he saw through the window a sergeant of police and he entered 
 policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they open the door of a javert mentioned his name showed his card to the sergeant and seated himself at the table of the post on which a candle was burning 
 on a table lay a pen a leaden inkstand and paper provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the night patrols 
 this table still completed by its chair is an institution it exists in all police stations it is invariably ornamented with a saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers and it forms the lowest stage of official style it is there that the literature of the state has its beginning 
 javert took a pen and a sheet of paper and began to write this is what he wrote 
 a few observations for the good of the service 
 in the first place 
 i beg monsieur le prefet to cast his eyes on this 
 secondly 
 prisoners on arriving after examination take off their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being searched 
 many of them cough on their return to prison this entails hospital expenses 
 thirdly 
 the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other so that in case one agent should for any cause grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take his place 
 fourthly 
 it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair even by paying for it 
 fifthly 
 in the madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand 
 sixthly 
 the prisoners called barkers who summon the other prisoners to the parlor force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly 
 this is a theft 
 seventhly 
 for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving shop this is an abuse of the contractor since the cloth is none the worse for it 
 eighthly 
 it is annoying for visitors to la force to be obliged to traverse the boys court in order to reach the parlor of 
 ninthly 
 it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating in the of the prefecture the interrogations put by the magistrates to prisoners 
 for a gendarme who should be sworn to secrecy to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder 
 tenthly 
 mme henry is an honest woman her canteen is very neat but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the of the secret cells 
 this is unworthy of the conciergerie of a great civilization 
 javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography not omitting a single comma and making the paper screech under his pen below the last line he 
 inspector of the st class 
 the post of the place du chatelet june th about one in the morning 
 javert dried the fresh ink on the paper folded it like a letter sealed it wrote on the back 
 note for the administration left it on the table and quitted the post 
 the glazed and grated door fell to behind him 
 again he traversed the place du chatelet diagonally regained the quay and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had abandoned a quarter of an hour previously leaned on his elbows and found himself again in the same attitude on the same of the parapet 
 he did not appear to have stirred 
 the darkness was complete 
 it was the sepulchral moment which follows midnight 
 a ceiling of clouds concealed the stars 
 not a single light burned in the houses of the city no one was passing all of the streets and quays which could be seen were deserted and the towers of the seemed features of the night 
 a street lantern reddened the margin of the quay the outlines of the bridges lay shapeless in the mist one behind the other 
 recent rains had swollen the river 
 the spot where javert was leaning was it will be remembered situated precisely over the rapids of the seine perpendicularly above that formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again like an endless screw 
 javert bent his head and gazed 
 all was black 
 nothing was to be distinguished 
 a sound of foam was audible but the river could not be seen 
 at moments in that dizzy depth a gleam of light appeared and undulated vaguely water possessing the power of taking light no one knows whence and converting it into a snake 
 the light vanished and all became indistinct once more 
 immensity seemed thrown open there 
 what lay below was not water it was a gulf the wall of the quay abrupt confused mingled with the vapors instantly concealed from sight produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite 
 nothing was to be seen but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt a fierce breath rose from this abyss 
 the flood in the river divined rather than perceived the tragic whispering of the waves the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge the imaginable fall into that gloomy void into all that shadow was full of horror 
 javert remained motionless for several minutes gazing at this opening of shadow he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled attention 
 the water roared 
 all at once he took off his hat and placed it on the edge of the quay 
 a moment later a tall black figure which a belated in the distance might have taken for a phantom appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay bent over towards the seine then drew itself up again and fell straight down into the shadows a dull splash followed and the shadow alone was in the secret of the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath the water

 first epilogue 
 chapter vii 
 
 in the winter of nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald hills with his wife his mother and sonya 
 within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his property and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as well 
 in another three years by he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiating to buy back otradnoe that being his pet dream 
 having started farming from necessity he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas was a plain farmer he did not like innovations especially the english ones then coming into vogue he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management disliked factories the raising of expensive products and the buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate he always had before his eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it the chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygen in the air nor manures nor special plows but that most important agent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made effective the peasant laborer when nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches it was the serf who especially attracted his attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watched the serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods their manner of speech and their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the peasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language to grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform toward them the duties demanded of him and nicholas management produced very brilliant results 
 guided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder and delegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose and these posts never changed hands before analyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit and credit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alike on the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelled from the commune 
 he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and corn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well or got so good a return as did nicholas 
 he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the drones as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity when a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if one had to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions 
 he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to make things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclined to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind 
 often speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he would say what can one do with our russian peasants and imagined that he could not bear them 
 yet he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his whole soul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results 
 countess mary was jealous of this passion of her and regretted that she could not share it but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and peasant matthew ermishin who with his family had carted corn all night or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say well one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under cover 
 still less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately refuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed 
 sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least it never entered my head and i do that for their good all poetry and old wives talk all that doing good to neighbor what i want is that our children should not have to go begging i must put our affairs in order while i am alive all and to do that order and strictness are essential all about it said he clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he can do no good either for himself or for me 
 and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a master the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he was not to be trifled with either in a word he was a real master

 book and grandfather 
 chapter i 
 
 in which the tree with the zinc plaster appears again 
 some time after the events which we have just recorded sieur boulatruelle experienced a lively emotion 
 sieur boulatruelle was that of montfermeil whom the reader has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book 
 boulatruelle as the reader may perchance recall was a man who was occupied with divers and troublesome matters 
 he broke stones and damaged travellers on the highway 
 and thief as he was he cherished one dream he believed in the treasures buried in the forest of montfermeil 
 he hoped some day to find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree in the meanwhile he lived to search the pockets of 
 nevertheless for an instant he was prudent 
 he had just escaped neatly 
 he had been as the reader is aware picked up in garret in company with the other ruffians utility of a vice 
 his drunkenness had been his salvation the authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had been robbed an order of nolle prosequi founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush had set him at liberty he had taken to his heels 
 he had returned to his road from gagny to lagny to make under administrative supervision broken stone for the good of the state with downcast mien in a very pensive mood his ardor for theft somewhat cooled but he was addicted none the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him 
 as for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after his return to his cot here it is 
 one morning boulatruelle while on his way as was his wont to his work and possibly also to his ambush a little before daybreak caught sight through the branches of the trees of a man whose back alone he saw but the shape of whose shoulders as it seemed to him at that distance and in the early dusk was not entirely unfamiliar to him 
 boulatruelle although intoxicated had a correct and lucid memory a defensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflict with legal order 
 where the deuce have i seen something like that man yonder he said to himself 
 but he could make himself no answer except that the man resembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace 
 however apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch boulatruelle put things together and made calculations 
 this man did not belong in the he had just arrived there on foot evidently 
 no public conveyance passes through montfermeil at that hour 
 he had walked all night 
 whence came he 
 not from a very great distance for he had neither haversack nor bundle from paris no doubt 
 why was he in these woods why was he there at such an hour what had he come there for 
 boulatruelle thought of the treasure 
 by dint of ransacking his memory he recalled in a vague way that he had already many years before had a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect that he might well be this very individual 
 by the deuce said boulatruelle find him again discover the parish of that parishioner 
 this prowler of has a reason and know it 
 people have secrets in my forest if i have a finger in the pie 
 he took his which was very sharply pointed 
 there now he grumbled is something that will search the earth and a man 
 and as one knots one thread to another thread he took up the line of march at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow and set out across the thickets 
 when he had compassed a hundred strides the day which was already beginning to break came to his assistance 
 footprints stamped in the sand weeds trodden down here and there heather crushed young branches in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who stretches herself when she wakes pointed out to him a sort of track 
 he followed it then lost it 
 time was flying he plunged deeper into the woods and came to a sort of eminence an early huntsman who was passing in the distance along a path whistling the air of guillery suggested to him the idea of climbing a tree 
 old as he was he was agile 
 there stood close at hand a of great size worthy of tityrus and of boulatruelle boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able 
 the idea was a good one 
 on scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side where the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild boulatruelle suddenly caught sight of his man 
 hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him 
 the man entered or rather glided into an open glade at a considerable distance masked by large trees but with which boulatruelle was perfectly familiar on account of having noticed near a large pile of porous stones an ailing bandaged with a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark this glade was the one which was formerly called the the heap of stones destined for no one knows what employment which was visible there thirty years ago is doubtless still there nothing equals a heap of stones in longevity unless it is a board fence they are temporary expedients 
 what a reason for lasting 
 boulatruelle with the rapidity of joy dropped rather than descended from the tree 
 the lair was unearthed the question now was to seize the beast 
 that famous treasure of his dreams was probably there 
 it was no small matter to reach that glade 
 by the beaten paths which indulge in a thousand teasing zigzags it required a good quarter of an hour 
 in a through the underbrush which is peculiarly dense very thorny and very aggressive in that locality a full half hour was necessary 
 boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this 
 he believed in the straight line a respectable optical illusion which ruins many a man 
 the thicket bristling as it was struck him as the best road 
 take to the wolves rue de rivoli said he 
 boulatruelle accustomed to taking crooked courses was on this occasion guilty of the fault of going straight 
 he flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth 
 he had to deal with holly bushes nettles hawthorns eglantines thistles and very irascible brambles 
 he was much lacerated 
 at the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to traverse 
 at last he reached the after the lapse of forty minutes sweating soaked breathless scratched and ferocious 
 there was no one in the glade 
 boulatruelle rushed to the heap of stones 
 it was in its place 
 it had not been carried off 
 as for the man he had vanished in the forest 
 he had made his escape where in what direction into what thicket 
 impossible to guess 
 and heartrending to say there behind the pile of stones in front of the tree with the sheet of zinc was freshly turned earth a abandoned or forgotten and a hole 
 the hole was empty 
 thief shrieked boulatruelle shaking his fist at the horizon

 first epilogue 
 chapter viii 
 
 one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed 
 once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo a man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the porch to question him and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard on returning to lunch nicholas went up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder countess mary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply 
 such an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mere recollection of him if he had told me he was drunk and did not see but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked 
 countess mary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered 
 why whatever is the matter my dearest 
 the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tears she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow or pity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm 
 the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry 
 nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas and she covered her face with her hands 
 nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and paced up and down the room he understood what she was weeping about but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it just sentimentality old wives tales or is she right he asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself 
 mary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again i give you my word never he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness 
 the tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes she took his hand and kissed it 
 nicholas when when did you break your cameo she asked to change the subject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of head 
 today it was the same affair oh mary remind me of it and again he flushed i give you my word of honor it occur again and let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the broken ring 
 after that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry but he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife and would again promise that this should really be the very last time 
 mary you must despise me he would say i deserve it 
 you should go go away at once if you feel strong enough to control yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband 
 among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the whole summer from spring sowing to harvest he was busy with the work on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business like seriousness leaving home for a month or even two with his hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading the books he read were chiefly historical and on these he spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he said a serious library and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought he would sit in his study with a grave air reading a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters in winter except for business excursions he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his relations with their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her 
 from the time of his marriage sonya had lived in his house before that nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and sonya blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done sonya felt herself to blame toward her and imagined that her wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not find fault with sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her but often felt toward her which she could not overcome 
 once she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about her own injustice toward her 
 you know said natasha you have read the gospels a great deal there is a passage in them that just fits sonya 
 what asked countess mary surprised 
 to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i know perhaps she lacks egotism i know but from her is taken away and everything has been taken away sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come off she is a sterile flower you know like some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorry for her and sometimes i think she feel it as you or i would 
 though countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel must be understood differently yet looking at sonya she agreed with explanation it really seemed that sonya did not feel her position trying and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole like a cat she had attached herself not to the people but to the home she waited on the old countess petted and spoiled the children was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude 
 the country seat at bald hills had been rebuilt though not on the same scale as under the old prince 
 the buildings begun under straitened circumstances were more than simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood plastered only inside it had bare deal floors and was furnished with very simple hard sofas armchairs tables and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood the house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors whole families of the rostovs and bolkonskis relations sometimes came to bald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months besides that four times a year on the name days and birthdays of the hosts as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations and its breakfasts lunches dinners and suppers provided out of the produce of the estate

 book and grandfather 
 chapter ii 
 
 marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic war 
 for a long time marius was neither dead nor alive 
 for many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by the wounds themselves 
 he repeated name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity of fever and with the sombre obstinacy of agony 
 the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become and consequently to kill the sick man under certain atmospheric conditions at every change of weather at the slightest storm the physician was uneasy 
 above all things he repeated let the wounded man be subjected to no emotion 
 the dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult the fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been invented as yet at that epoch nicolette used up a sheet as big as the ceiling as she put it for lint 
 it was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene as long as there was any danger m gillenormand seated in despair at his pillow was like marius neither alive nor dead 
 every day sometimes twice a day a very well dressed gentleman with white was the description given by the porter came to inquire about the wounded man and left a large package of lint for the dressings 
 finally on the th of september four months to a day after the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius 
 convalescence began 
 but marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched out on a long chair on account of the results called up by the fracture of his there always is a last wound like that which will not close and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely to the great annoyance of the sick person 
 however this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from all pursuit 
 in france there is no wrath not even of a public character which six months will not extinguish 
 revolts in the present state of society are so much the fault of every one that they are followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes 
 let us add that the inexcusable gisquet order which enjoined doctors to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the councils of war did not dare to trouble any one so marius was left in peace 
 m gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish and then through every form of ecstasy 
 it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man he had his big carried to marius bedside he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages mademoiselle gillenormand like a sage and elderly person contrived to spare the fine linen while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed 
 m gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him that for the preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen nor new linen as old linen 
 he was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which mademoiselle gillenormand modestly absented herself when the dead flesh was cut away with scissors he said 
 aie aie nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle senile palsy offer the wounded man a cup of his he overwhelmed the doctor with questions 
 he did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over again 
 on the day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of danger the good man was in a delirium 
 he made his porter a present of three louis 
 that evening on his return to his own chamber he danced a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the following est nee a fougere amour tu vis en elle 
 vrai nid bergere 
 car dans sa prunelle 
 son tu mets ton carquois 
 fripon 
 narquois 
 moi je la chante et plus que diane meme jeanne et ses durs tetons bretons jeanne was born at fougere a true nest i adore her petticoat the rogue 
 love thou dwellest in her for tis in her eyes that thou placest thy quiver sly scamp 
 as for me i sing her and i love more than diana herself jeanne and her firm breton breasts 
 then he knelt upon a chair and basque who was watching him through the door made sure that he was praying 
 up to that time he had not believed in god 
 at each succeeding phase of improvement which became more and more pronounced the grandfather raved 
 he executed a multitude of mechanical actions full of joy he ascended and descended the stairs without knowing why 
 a pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a big bouquet it was m gillenormand who had sent it to her 
 the husband made a jealous scene 
 m gillenormand tried to draw nicolette upon his knees 
 he called marius m le baron he shouted 
 long live the republic 
 every moment he kept asking the doctor 
 is he no longer in danger he gazed upon marius with the eyes of a grandmother 
 he brooded over him while he ate 
 he no longer knew himself he no longer rendered himself an account of himself 
 marius was the master of the house there was abdication in his joy he was the grandson of his grandson 
 in the state of joy in which he then was he was the most venerable of children 
 in his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent he stepped behind him to smile 
 he was content joyous delighted charming young 
 his white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage 
 when grace is mingled with wrinkles it is adorable 
 there is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age 
 as for marius as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him he had but one fixed idea 
 cosette 
 after the fever and delirium had left him he did not again pronounce her name and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of her 
 he held his peace precisely because his soul was there 
 he did not know what had become of cosette the whole affair of the rue de la chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory shadows that were almost indistinct floated through his mind eponine gavroche mabeuf the thenardiers all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of the barricade the strange passage of m fauchelevent through that adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest he understood nothing connected with his own life he did not know how nor by whom he had been saved and no one of those around him knew this all that they had been able to tell him was that he had been brought home at night in a to the rue des past present future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea but in that fog there was one immovable point one clear and precise outline something made of granite a resolution a will to find cosette once more for him the idea of life was not distinct from the idea of cosette he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept the one without the other and he was immovably resolved to exact of any person whatever who should desire to force him to his grandfather from fate from restitution of his vanished eden 
 he did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed 
 let us here emphasize one detail he was not won over and was but little softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather in the first place he was not in the secret then in his reveries of an invalid which were still feverish possibly he distrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel thing which had for its object his conquest 
 he remained cold 
 the grandfather absolutely 
 wasted his poor old smile 
 marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he marius did not speak and let things take their course but that when it became a question of cosette he would find another face and that his true attitude would be unmasked 
 then there would be an unpleasant scene a recrudescence of family questions a confrontation of positions every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time fauchelevent coupelevent fortune poverty a stone about his neck the future 
 violent resistance conclusion 
 a refusal marius stiffened himself in advance 
 and then in proportion as he regained life the old ulcers of his memory opened once more he reflected again on the past colonel pontmercy placed himself once more between m gillenormand and him marius he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect from a person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father and with health there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his grandfather 
 the old man was gently pained by this m gillenormand without however allowing it to appear observed that marius ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness had not once called him father it is true that he did not say monsieur to him but he contrived not to say either the one or the other by means of a certain way of turning his phrases 
 obviously a crisis was approaching 
 as almost always happens in such cases marius skirmished before giving battle by way of proving himself 
 this is called feeling the ground 
 one morning it came to pass that m gillenormand spoke slightingly of the convention apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands and gave vent to a royalist harangue on danton and men of were giants said marius with severity 
 the old man held his peace and uttered not a sound during the remainder of that day 
 marius who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of his early years interpreted this silence as a profound concentration of wrath augured from it a hot conflict and augmented his preparations for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind 
 he decided that in case of a refusal he would tear off his bandages dislocate his that he would lay bare all the wounds which he had left and would reject all food 
 his wounds were his munitions of war 
 he would have cosette or die 
 he awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick 
 that moment arrived

 first epilogue 
 chapter ix 
 
 it was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december natasha had been staying at her with her husband and children since early autumn pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute 
 besides the bezukhov family nicholas old friend the retired general vasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth of december 
 on the sixth which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for a tail coat and put on narrow boots with pointed toes and drive to the new church he had built and then receive visitors who would come to congratulate him offer them refreshments and talk about the elections of the nobility but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way he examined the accounts of the village in ryazan which belonged to his nephew wrote two business letters and walked over to the granaries cattle yards and stables before dinner having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great day he returned to dinner and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons at which the whole household had assembled at that table were his mother his old lady companion belova his wife their three children with their governess and tutor his nephew with his tutor sonya denisov natasha her three children their governess and old michael ivanovich the late architect who was living on in retirement at bald hills 
 countess mary sat at the other end of the table when her husband took his place she concluded from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him that he was out of humor as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm especially before the soup countess mary well knew that mood of his and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason and she felt unhappy she asked him where he had been he replied she again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily 
 then not mistaken thought countess mary why is he cross with me she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation she knew her remarks sounded unnatural but could not refrain from asking some more questions 
 thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general and lively and she did not talk to her husband when they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess countess mary held out her hand and kissed her husband and asked him why he was angry with her 
 you always have such strange fancies i even think of being angry he replied 
 but the word always seemed to her to imply yes i am angry but i tell you why 
 nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya and the old countess who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree could find nothing to reproach them with but even they had their moments of antagonism occasionally and it was always just after they had been happiest together they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility which occurred most frequently during countess pregnancies and this was such a time 
 well messieurs et mesdames said nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to vex her i have been on my feet since six this morning tomorrow i shall have to suffer so today go and rest 
 and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa 
 always the way thought countess mary he talks to everyone except me i see i see that i am repulsive to him especially when i am in this condition she looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale sallow emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever 
 and everything annoyed her shouting and laughter talk and especially a quick glance sonya gave her 
 sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling irritated 
 having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying she softly left the room and went to the nursery 
 the children were playing at going to moscow in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them she sat down and played with them a little but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her she got up and walking on tiptoe with difficulty went to the small sitting room 
 perhaps he is not asleep have an explanation with him she said to herself little andrew her eldest boy imitating his mother followed her on tiptoe she not notice him 
 mary dear i think he is asleep he was so tired said sonya meeting her in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that she crossed her path everywhere andrew may wake him 
 countess mary looked round saw little andrew following her felt that sonya was right and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh she made no reply but to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door sonya went away by another door from the room in which nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead his mustache and his whole face as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat and at that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door papa standing here countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy he grew silent and quiet ensued for a moment terrible to countess mary she knew how nicholas disliked being waked then through the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring and his voice said crossly 
 i get a peace mary is that you why did you bring him here 
 i only came in to look and did not notice forgive me 
 nicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery five minutes later little natasha her pet having learned from her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room ran to her father unobserved by her mother the little girl boldly opened the creaking door went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs and having examined the position of her father who was asleep with his back to her rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face 
 natasha natasha came countess frightened whisper from the door papa wants to sleep 
 no mamma he want to sleep said little natasha with conviction laughing 
 nicholas lowered his legs rose and took his daughter in his arms 
 come in mary he said to his wife 
 she went in and sat down by her husband 
 i did not notice him following me she said timidly i just looked in 
 holding his little girl with one arm nicholas glanced at his wife and seeing her guilty expression put his other arm around her and kissed her hair 
 may i kiss mamma he asked natasha 
 natasha smiled bashfully 
 again she commanded pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where nicholas had placed the kiss 
 i know why you think i am cross said nicholas replying to the question he knew was in his mind 
 you have no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are like that it always seems to me 
 mary talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he said gaily 
 it seems to be that you love me that i am so plain always and now in this cond 
 oh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears love that makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty but do i love my wife i love her but i know how to put it without you or when something comes between us like this i seem lost and do anything now do i love my finger i love it but just try to cut it off 
 not like that myself but i understand so not angry with me 
 awfully angry he said smiling and getting up and smoothing his hair he began to pace the room 
 do you know mary what been thinking he began immediately thinking aloud in his presence now that they had made it up 
 he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he told her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring 
 countess mary listened till he had finished made some remark and in her turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were about the children 
 you can see the woman in her already she said in french pointing to little natasha you reproach us women with being illogical here is our logic i say papa wants to sleep but she says no laughing and she was right said countess mary with a happy smile 
 yes yes and nicholas taking his little daughter in his strong hand lifted her high placed her on his shoulder held her by the legs and paced the room with her there was an expression of carefree happiness on the faces of both father and daughter 
 but you know you may be unfair you are too fond of this one his wife whispered in french 
 yes but what am i to do i try not to show 
 at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in the hall and anteroom as if someone had arrived 
 somebody has come 
 i am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary and left the room 
 in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a gallop round the room out of breath he took the laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart his capers reminded him of dancing and looking at the round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was an old man taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had danced daniel cooper with his daughter 
 it is he it is he nicholas said countess mary the room a few minutes later now our natasha has come to life you should have seen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so long well come along now quick quick time you two were parted she added looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father 
 nicholas went out holding the child by the hand 
 countess mary remained in the sitting room 
 i should never never have believed that one could be so happy she whispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt through her happiness that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant

 chapter iii 
 
 marius attacked 
 one day m gillenormand while his daughter was putting in order the phials and cups on the marble of the commode bent over marius and said to him in his tenderest accents 
 look here my little marius if i were in your place i would eat meat now in preference to fish a fried sole is excellent to begin a convalescence with but a good cutlet is needed to put a sick man on his feet 
 marius who had almost entirely recovered his strength collected the whole of it drew himself up into a sitting posture laid his two clenched fists on the sheets of his bed looked his grandfather in the face assumed a terrible air and said 
 this leads me to say something to you 
 what is it 
 that i wish to marry 
 agreed said his he burst out laughing 
 how agreed 
 yes agreed 
 you shall have your little girl 
 marius stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock trembled in every limb 
 m gillenormand went on 
 yes you shall have her that pretty little girl of yours she comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you 
 ever since you were wounded she has passed her time in weeping and making lint 
 i have made inquiries 
 she lives in the rue de arme no 
 ah 
 there we have it ah so you want her 
 well you shall have her 
 caught you had arranged your little plot you had said to going to signify this squarely to my grandfather to that mummy of the regency and of the directory to that ancient beau to that dorante turned geronte he has indulged in his frivolities also that he has and he has had his love affairs and his grisettes and his cosettes he has made his rustle he has had his wings he has eaten of the bread of spring he certainly must remember it ah you take the cockchafer by the horns 
 good 
 i offer you a cutlet and you answer me 
 by the way i want to marry a transition for you 
 ah you reckoned on a bickering you do not know that i am an old coward 
 what do you say to that you are vexed 
 you did not expect to find your grandfather still more foolish than yourself you are wasting the discourse which you meant to bestow upon me mr lawyer and vexatious well so much the worse rage away 
 do whatever you wish and that cuts you short imbecile 
 listen 
 i have made my inquiries cunning too she is charming she is discreet it is not true about the lancer she has made heaps of lint a jewel she adores you if you had died there would have been three of us her coffin would have accompanied mine 
 i have had an idea ever since you have been better of simply planting her at your bedside but it is only in romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome young wounded men who interest them 
 it is not done what would your aunt have said to it 
 you were nude three quarters of the time my good fellow 
 ask nicolette who has not left you for a moment if there was any possibility of having a woman here and then what would the doctor have said 
 a pretty girl does not cure a man of fever 
 in short all right let us say no more about it said done all settled take her such is my ferocity 
 you see i perceived that you did not love me i said to myself 
 here now i have my little cosette right under my hand going to give her to him he will be obliged to love me a little then or he must tell the reason why 
 ah so you thought that the old man was going to storm to put on a big voice to shout no and to lift his cane at all that aurora 
 not a bit of it 
 cosette so be it love so be it i ask nothing better pray take the trouble of getting married sir 
 be happy my child 
 that said the old man burst forth into sobs 
 and he seized marius head and pressed it with both arms against his breast and both fell to weeping 
 this is one of the forms of supreme happiness 
 father cried marius 
 ah so you love me said the old man 
 an ineffable moment ensued 
 they were choking and could not speak 
 at length the old man stammered 
 come his mouth is unstopped at last 
 he has said 
 father to me 
 marius disengaged his head from his arms and said gently 
 but father now that i am quite well it seems to me that i might see her 
 agreed again you shall see her 
 father 
 what 
 why not 
 well then 
 let it be you have called me father three times and it is worth it 
 i will attend to it 
 she shall be brought hither 
 agreed i tell you 
 it has already been put into verse 
 this is the ending of the elegy of the jeune malade by andre chenier by andre chenier whose throat was cut by the ras by the giants of 
 m gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of marius who in truth as we must admit was no longer listening to him and who was thinking far more of cosette than of 
 the grandfather trembling at having so inopportunely introduced andre chenier resumed precipitately 
 cut his throat is not the word 
 the fact is that the great revolutionary geniuses who were not malicious that is incontestable who were heroes pardi found that andre chenier embarrassed them somewhat and they had him guillot that is to say those great men on the th of thermidor besought andre chenier in the interests of public safety to be so good as to go 
 m gillenormand clutched by the throat by his own phrase could not proceed 
 being able neither to finish it nor to retract it while his daughter arranged the pillow behind marius who was overwhelmed with so many emotions the old man rushed headlong with as much rapidity as his age permitted from the shut the door behind him and purple choking and foaming at the mouth his eyes starting from his head he found himself nose to nose with honest basque who was blacking boots in the anteroom he seized basque by the collar and shouted full in his face in the hundred thousand javottes of the devil those ruffians did assassinate him 
 who sir 
 andre chenier 
 yes sir said basque in alarm

 first epilogue 
 chapter x 
 
 natasha had married in the early spring of and in already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing she had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively natasha of former days her features were more defined and had a calm soft and serene expression in her face there was none of the animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm now her face and body were of all that one saw and her soul was not visible at all all that struck the eye was a strong handsome and fertile woman the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now that happened only when as was the case that day her husband returned home or a sick child was convalescent or when she and countess mary spoke of prince andrew she never mentioned him to her husband who she imagined was jealous of prince memory or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage at the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days 
 since their marriage natasha and her husband had lived in moscow in petersburg on their estate near moscow or with her mother that is to say in nicholas house the young countess bezukhova was not often seen in society and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable not that natasha liked solitude she did not know whether she liked it or not she even thought that she did not but with her pregnancies her confinements the nursing of her children and sharing every moment of her life she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society all who had known natasha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband as she herself had once exclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood natasha and she kept saying that she had always known that natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother 
 only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurd 
 natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk especially by the french which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries should not neglect her accomplishments should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part she gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive she took no pains with her manners or with of speech or with her toilet or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting she acted in contradiction to all those rules she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely that is with her whole soul leaving no corner of it hidden from him she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her but by something else indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul 
 to fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable she did not know but she had no time at all for it the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dress or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things 
 we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if entire attention is devoted to it 
 the subject which wholly engrossed attention was her family that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear bring into the world nurse and bring up 
 and the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her whole soul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary 
 there were then as now conversations and discussions about rights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha she positively did not understand them 
 these questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that is only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance which lies in the family 
 discussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from dinner did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the family 
 if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinners 
 if the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that case will not have a family 
 if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family that is one wife or one husband natasha needed a husband a husband was given her and he gave her a family and she not only saw no need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different 
 natasha did not care for society in general but prized the more the society of her relatives countess mary and her brother her mother and sonya she valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on napkin and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better 
 to such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair her words and her jealousy she was jealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plain were habitual subjects of jest to those about her the general opinion was that pierre was under his thumb which was really true from the very first days of their married life natasha had announced her demands pierre was greatly surprised by his view to him a perfectly novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family his demands astonished him but they also flattered him and he submitted to them 
 subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman did not dare dine at the club as a pastime did not dare spend money a whim and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on business in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance to make up for this at home pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied that is was reading or writing in his study pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it 
 the entire household was governed according to supposed orders that is by his wishes which natasha tried to guess their way of life and place of residence their acquaintances and ties occupations the upbringing were all selected not merely with regard to expressed wishes but to what natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be and she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons 
 thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nurse three times and natasha fell ill from despair pierre one day told her of view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful when her next baby was born despite the opposition of her mother the doctors and even of her husband himself who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself a thing then unheard of and considered injurious she insisted on having her own way and after that nursed all her babies herself 
 it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute but long afterwards pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion 
 after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife all that was not quite good was rejected and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection

 book and grandfather 
 chapter iv 
 
 mademoiselle gillenormand ends by no longer thinking it a bad thing that m fauchelevent should have entered with something under his arm 
 cosette and marius beheld each other once more 
 what that interview was like we decline to say 
 there are things which one must not attempt to depict the sun is one of them 
 the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in marius chamber at the moment when cosette entered it 
 precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and gazing over it at cosette 
 she appeared on the threshold it seemed to him that she was surrounded by a glory 
 adorable he exclaimed 
 then he blew his nose noisily 
 cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven she was as thoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness she stammered all pale yet flushed she wanted to fling herself into marius arms and dared not 
 ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people 
 people are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone 
 lovers have no need of any people whatever 
 with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile it was monsieur fauchelevent it was jean valjean 
 he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely in black in perfectly new garments and with a white cravat 
 the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct bourgeois in this probable notary the bearer of the corpse who had sprung up at his door on the night of the th of june tattered muddy hideous haggard his face masked in blood and mire supporting in his arms the fainting marius still his scent was aroused 
 when m fauchelevent arrived with cosette the porter had not been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside 
 i know why it is but i help fancying that seen that face before 
 m fauchelevent in marius chamber remained apart near the door he had under his arm a package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume enveloped in paper 
 the enveloping paper was of a greenish hue and appeared to be mouldy 
 does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm mademoiselle gillenormand who did not like books demanded in a low tone of nicolette 
 well retorted m gillenormand who had overheard her in the same tone a learned man 
 what then 
 is that his fault monsieur boulard one of my acquaintances never walked out without a book under his arm either and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that 
 and with a bow he said aloud 
 monsieur tranchelevent 
 
 father gillenormand did not do it intentionally but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his 
 monsieur tranchelevent i have the honor of asking you on behalf of my grandson baron marius pontmercy for the hand of mademoiselle 
 monsieur tranchelevent bowed 
 settled said the grandfather 
 and turning to marius and cosette with both arms extended in blessing he cried 
 permission to adore each other 
 they did not require him to repeat it twice 
 so much the worse the chirping began 
 they talked low 
 marius resting on his elbow on his reclining chair cosette standing beside him 
 oh heavens murmured cosette i see you once again it is thou it is you the idea of going and fighting like that 
 but why 
 it is horrible i have been dead for four months 
 oh how wicked it was of you to go to that battle 
 what had i done to you 
 i pardon you but you will never do it again 
 a little while ago when they came to tell us to come to you i still thought that i was about to die but it was from joy 
 i was so sad 
 i have not taken the time to dress myself i must frighten people with my looks what will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar do speak 
 you let me do all the talking 
 we are still in the rue de arme 
 it seems that your shoulder was terrible they told me that you could put your fist in it 
 and then it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors 
 that is frightful i have cried till i have no eyes left 
 it is queer that a person can suffer like that 
 your grandfather has a very kindly air disturb yourself rise on your elbow you will injure yourself 
 oh how happy i am 
 so our unhappiness is over i am quite foolish 
 i had things to say to you and i no longer know in the least what they were 
 do you still love me 
 we live in the rue de arme 
 there is no garden 
 i made lint all the time stay sir look it is your fault i have a callous on my fingers 
 angel said marius 
 angel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out no other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it 
 then as there were spectators they paused and said not a word more contenting themselves with softly touching each hands 
 m gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried 
 talk loud the rest of you 
 make a noise you people behind the scenes 
 come a little uproar the deuce so that the children can chatter at their ease 
 and approaching marius and cosette he said to them in a very low voice 
 call each other thou 
 stand on ceremony 
 aunt gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light in her elderly household 
 there was nothing aggressive about this amazement it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and envious glance of an owl at two it was the stupid eye of a poor innocent seven and fifty years of age it was a life which had been a failure gazing at that triumph love 
 mademoiselle gillenormand senior said her father to her i told you that this is what would happen to you 
 he remained silent for a moment and then added 
 look at the happiness of others 
 then he turned to cosette 
 how pretty she is how pretty she is 
 a greuze so you are going to have that all to yourself you scamp ah my rogue you are getting off nicely with me you are happy if i were not fifteen years too old we would fight with swords to see which of us should have her 
 come now 
 i am in love with you mademoiselle 
 perfectly simple 
 it is your right you are in the right 
 ah what a sweet charming little wedding this will make 
 our parish is du saint sacrament but i will get a dispensation so that you can be married at the church is better 
 it was built by the jesuits it is more coquettish 
 it is opposite the fountain of cardinal de birague 
 the masterpiece of jesuit architecture is at namur it is called you must go there after you are married it is worth the journey 
 mademoiselle i am quite of your mind i think girls ought to marry that is what they are made for there is a certain whom i should always like to see uncoiffed a fine thing to remain a spinster but it is chilly 
 the bible says 
 multiply 
 in order to save the people jeanne is needed but in order to make people what is needed is mother goose 
 so marry my beauties 
 i really do not see the use in remaining a spinster 
 i know that they have their chapel apart in the church and that they fall back on the society of the virgin but sapristi a handsome husband a fine fellow and at the expiration of a year a big blond brat who nurses lustily and who has fine rolls of fat on his thighs and who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy paws laughing the while like the better than holding a candle at vespers and chanting turris eburnea 
 in allusion to the expression coiffer to remain unmarried 
 the grandfather executed a pirouette on his heels and began to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more ainsi bornant les cours de tes revasseries alcippe il est donc vrai dans peu tu te maries 
 thus hemming in the course of thy musings alcippus it is true that thou wilt wed ere long 
 by the way 
 what is it father 
 have not you an intimate friend 
 yes courfeyrac 
 what has become of him 
 he is dead 
 that is good 
 he seated himself near them made cosette sit down and took their four hands in his aged and wrinkled hands 
 she is exquisite this darling 
 a masterpiece this cosette she is a very little girl and a very great lady 
 she will only be a baroness which is a come down for her she was born a marquise what eyelashes she has 
 get it well fixed in your noddles my children that you are in the true road 
 love each other be foolish about it 
 love is the folly of men and the wit of god adore each other 
 only he added suddenly becoming gloomy what a misfortune 
 it has just occurred to me 
 more than half of what i possess is swallowed up in an annuity so long as i live it will not matter but after my death a score of years hence ah my poor children you will not have a sou 
 your beautiful white hands madame la baronne will do the devil the honor of pulling him by the tail 
 tirer le diable par la queue to live from hand to mouth 
 at this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say 
 mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent possesses six hundred thousand francs 
 it was the voice of jean valjean 
 so far he had not uttered a single word no one seemed to be aware that he was there and he had remained standing erect and motionless behind all these happy people 
 what has mademoiselle euphrasie to do with the question inquired the startled grandfather 
 i am she replied cosette 
 six hundred thousand francs resumed m gillenormand 
 minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs possibly said jean valjean 
 and he laid on the table the package which mademoiselle gillenormand had mistaken for a book 
 jean valjean himself opened the package it was a bundle of they were turned over and counted 
 there were five hundred notes for a thousand francs each and one hundred and of five hundred 
 in all five hundred and thousand francs 
 this is a fine book said m gillenormand 
 five hundred and thousand francs murmured the aunt 
 this arranges things well does it not mademoiselle gillenormand senior said the grandfather 
 that devil of a marius has ferreted out the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams just trust to the love affairs of young folks now will you students find studentesses with six hundred thousand francs cherubino works better than rothschild 
 five hundred and thousand francs repeated mademoiselle gillenormand in a low tone 
 five hundred and one might as well say six hundred thousand 
 as for marius and cosette they were gazing at each other while this was going on they hardly heeded this detail

 first epilogue 
 chapter xi 
 
 two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovs he had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to come to petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal founders 
 on reading that letter she always read her letters natasha herself suggested that he should go to petersburg though she would feel his absence very acutely she attributed immense importance to all her intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters to timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for his return he was given four weeks leave of absence 
 ever since that leave of absence had expired more than a fortnight before natasha had been in a constant state of alarm depression and irritability 
 denisov now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear a dull dejected look random replies and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress 
 natasha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her mother her brother sonya or countess mary in their efforts to console her tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning 
 all nonsense all rubbish those discussions which lead to nothing and all those idiotic societies natasha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed 
 and she would go to the nursery to nurse petya her only boy no one else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose that creature said you are angry you are jealous you would like to pay him out you are afraid but here am i and i am he and that was unanswerable it was more than true 
 during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for comfort so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him and he fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was just what she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily 
 she was nursing her boy when the sound of sleigh was heard at the front door and the old nurse knowing how to please her mistress entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face 
 has he come natasha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move lest she should rouse the dozing baby 
 come whispered the nurse 
 the blood rushed to face and her feet involuntarily moved but she could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his eyes and looked at her here he seemed to be saying and again lazily smacked his lips 
 cautiously withdrawing her breast natasha rocked him a little handed him to the nurse and went with rapid steps toward the door but at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon and she glanced round the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot 
 go worry go she whispered smiling with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress 
 natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom 
 denisov who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe now for the first time recognized the old natasha a flood of brilliant joyful light poured from her transfigured face 
 come she exclaimed as she ran past and denisov felt that he too was delighted that pierre whom he did not much care for had returned 
 on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf he really he he has come she said to herself and rushing at him embraced him pressed his head to her breast and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy happy face covered with hoarfrost yes it is he happy and contented 
 then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight and the joy that had lit up her face vanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words 
 yes all very well for you you are pleased had a good time but what about me you might at least have shown consideration for the children i am nursing and my milk was spoiled petya was at door but you were enjoying yourself yes enjoying 
 pierre knew he was not to blame for he could not have come sooner he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so he made a piteous frightened face and bent down 
 i could not on my honor but how is petya 
 all right now come along i wonder not ashamed if only you could see what i was like without you how i suffered 
 you are well 
 come come she said not letting go of his arm and they went to their rooms 
 when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby son who was again awake on his huge right palm and dandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the broad face with its toothless open mouth the storm was long since over and there was bright joyous sunshine on face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child 
 and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore she asked 
 yes capitally 
 you see he holds it up she meant the head but how he did frighten me seen the princess is it true in love with that 
 yes just fancy 
 at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the baby on his hand stooped kissed them and replied to their inquiries but in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed the baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention 
 how sweet said countess mary looking at and playing with the baby now nicholas she added turning to her husband i understand how it is you see the charm of these delicious marvels 
 i and replied nicholas looking coldly at the baby a lump of flesh come along pierre 
 and yet such an affectionate father said countess mary vindicating her husband but only after they are a year old or so 
 now pierre nurses them splendidly said natasha he says his hand is just made for a seat just look 
 only not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse

 deposit your money in a forest rather than with a notary 
 the reader has no doubt understood without necessitating a lengthy explanation that jean valjean after the champmathieu affair had been able thanks to his first escape of a few days duration to come to paris and to withdraw in season from the hands of laffitte the sum earned by him under the name of monsieur madeleine at and that fearing that he might be recaptured which eventually had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of montfermeil in the locality known as the the sum six hundred and thirty thousand francs all in was not very bulky and was contained in a box only in order to preserve the box from dampness he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings 
 in the same coffer he had placed his other treasures the candlesticks 
 it will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape from the man seen one evening for the first time by boulatruelle was jean valjean 
 later on every time that jean valjean needed money he went to get it in the hence the absences which we have mentioned 
 he had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather in a known to himself alone 
 when he beheld marius convalescent feeling that the hour was at hand when that money might prove of service he had gone to get it it was he again whom boulatruelle had seen in the woods but on this occasion in the morning instead of in the evening 
 boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe 
 the actual sum was five hundred and thousand five hundred francs 
 jean valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for shall see hereafter he thought 
 the difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years from to 
 the five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs 
 jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint 
 moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert the story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in the moniteur how a police inspector named javert had been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses between the pont au change and the and that a writing left by this man otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a fit of mental aberration and a fact thought jean valjean since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must have been already mad

 first epilogue 
 chapter xii 
 
 as in every large household there were at bald hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others every event joyful or sad that took place in that house was important to all these worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others 
 for instance return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so 
 the servants the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life were glad of return because they knew that when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day attend to the estate and would would be in better spirits and temper and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays 
 the children and their governesses were glad of return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only piece to which as he said all possible dances could be danced and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all 
 young nicholas now a slim lad of fifteen delicate and intelligent with curly hair and beautiful eyes was delighted because uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection no one had instilled into him this love for pierre whom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him and little nicholas did love his uncle but loved him with just a shade of contempt pierre however he adored he did not want to be an hussar or a knight of st george like his uncle nicholas he wanted to be learned wise and kind like pierre in presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to him he did not miss a single word he uttered and would afterwards with dessalles or by himself recall and reconsider the meaning of everything pierre had said past life and his unhappiness prior to of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard his adventures in moscow his captivity platon karataev of whom he had heard from pierre his love for natasha of whom the lad was also particularly fond and especially friendship with the father whom nicholas could not remember all this made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint 
 from broken remarks about natasha and his father from the emotion with which pierre spoke of that dead father and from the careful reverent tenderness with which natasha spoke of him the boy who was only just beginning to guess what love is derived the notion that his father had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his friend but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture so the boy also was happy that pierre had arrived 
 the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in 
 the members of the family not to mention his wife were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully 
 the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them and especially that natasha would now be herself again 
 pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations 
 though the most and forgetful of men pierre with the aid of a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgetting his mother and commissions nor the dress material for a present to belova nor toys for his nephews in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything but in time he grew used to this demand knowing that natasha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house and never forgot anything if he now incurred censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things to her other defects as most people thought them but which to pierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she now added stinginess 
 from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before and that his affairs which had been in disorder of late chiefly because of his first debts had begun to improve 
 life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive luxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was no longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power and so that way of life proved economical 
 with a merry smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases 
 what do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman 
 natasha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her 
 for belova excellent she felt the quality of the material it was a ruble an arshin i suppose 
 pierre told her the price 
 too dear natasha remarked how pleased the children will be and mamma too only you need not have bought me this she added unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls of a kind then just coming into fashion 
 adele tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned pierre 
 when am i to wear it and natasha stuck it in her coil of hair when i take little masha into society perhaps they will be fashionable again by then well go now 
 and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess rooms 
 the countess was sitting with her companion belova playing as usual when pierre and natasha came into the drawing room with parcels under their arms 
 the countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with a frill that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper lip had sunk in and her eyes were dim 
 after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence she ate drank slept or kept awake but did not live life gave her no new impressions she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only death could give her but until death came she had to go on living that is to use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her her life had no external aims only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weep work give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had a stomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs she cried as a child does because her nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext 
 thus in the morning especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext deafness 
 she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room 
 it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur 
 and when belova replied oh yes come she would mutter angrily o lord how stupid and deaf she is 
 another pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belova would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her faculty of thinking and the pretext for that was a game of patience when she needed to cry the deceased count would be the pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and his health would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the pretext would be countess mary when her vocal organs needed exercise which was usually toward seven when she had had an rest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience 
 the old condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between nicholas pierre natasha and countess mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed 
 but those glances expressed something more they said that she had played her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole self that we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield to her to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied memento mori said these glances 
 only the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her

 of riches 
 i cannot call riches better than the baggage of virtue the roman word is better 
 impedimenta for as the baggage is to an army so is riches to virtue it cannot be 
 spared nor left behind but it hindreth the march yea and the care of it sometimes loseth or disturbed the victory of great riches there is no real use except it be in the distribution the rest is but conceit so saith solomon where much is there are many to consume it and what hath the owner but the sight of it with his eyes 
 
 the personal fruition in any man cannot reach to feel great riches there is a custody of them or a power of dole and donative of them or a fame of them but no solid use to the owner do you not see what feigned prices are set upon little stones and rarities and what works of ostentation are undertaken because there might seem to be some use of great riches but then you will say they may be of use to buy men out of dangers or troubles 
 as solomon saith riches are as a strong hold in the imagination of the rich man but bus is excellently expressed that it is in imagination and not always in fact for certainly great riches have sold more men than they have bought out seek not proud riches but such as thou mayest get justly use soberly distribute cheerfully and leave contentedly yet have no abstract nor friarly contempt of them but distinguish as cicero saith well of rabirius postumus in studio rei amplificandae apparebat non avaritiae praedam sed instumenturn bonitati quaeri hearken also to solomon and beware of hasty gathering of riches qidfestinat ad divitias non erit insons the poets feign that when plutus which is riches is sent from jupiter he limps and goes slowly but when he is sent from pluto he runs and is swift of foot meaning that riches gotten by good means and just labour pace slowly but when they come by the death of others as by the course of inheritance testaments and the like they come tumbling upon a man but it mought be applied likewise to pluto taking him for the devil for when riches come from the devil as by fraud and oppression and unjust means they come upon speed the ways to enrich are many and most of them foul 
 
 parsimony is one of the best and yet is not innocent for it withholdeth men from 
 works of liberality and charity the improvement of the ground is me most natural 
 obtaining of riches for it is our great blessing the but it is 
 slow and yet where men of great wealth do stoop to husbandry it muldplieth riches exceedingly i knew a nobleman in england that had the greatest audits of any man in my time a great grazier a great a great timber man a great collier a great a great and so of iron and a number of the like points of husbandry so as the earth seemed a sea to him in respect of the perpetual importation it was truly observed by one that himself came very hardly to a little riches and very easily to great riches for when a stock is come to that that he can expect the prime of markets and overcome those bargains which for their greatness are few money and be partner in the industries of younger men he cannot but increase mainly the gains of ordinary trades and vocations are honest and furthered by two things chiefly by diligence and by a good name for good and fair dealing but the gains of bargains are of a more doubtful nature when men shall wait upon others necessity broke by 
 servants and instruments to draw them on put off others cunningly that would be better chapmen and the like practices which are crafty and naught as for the chopping of bargains when a man buys not to hold but to sell over again that commonly grindeth double both upon the seller and upon the buyer sharings do greatly enrich if the hands be well chosen that are trusted usury is the certainest means of gain though one of the worst as that whereby a man doth eat his bread in sudore vultus alieni and besides doth plough upon sundays but yet certain though it be it hath flaws for that the scriveners and brokers do value unsound men to serve their own turn 
 
 the fortune in being the first in an invention or in a privilege doth cause 
 sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in riches as it was with the first sugar man in 
 the canaries therefore if a man can play the true logician to have as well judgement as invention he may do great matters especially if the times be fit he that resteth upon gains certain shall hardly grow to great riches and he that puts all upon adventures doth often times break and come to poverty it is good therefore to guard adventures with certainties that may uphold losses monopolies and coemption of wares for resale where they are not restrained are great means to enrich especially if the party have intelligence what things are like to come into request and so store himself beforehand riches gotten by service though it be of the best rise yet when they are gotten by flattery feeding humours and other servile conditions they may be placed amongst the worst as for fishing for testaments and executorships as tacitus saith of seneca testamenta et orbos tanquam indagine capi it is yet worse by how much men submit themselves to meaner persons than in service 
 
 believe not much them that seem to despise riches for they despise them that despair of them and none worse when they come to them be not riches have wings and sometimes they fly away of themselves sometimes they must be set flying to bring in more men leave their riches either to their kindred or to the public and moderate portions prosper best in both a great state left to an heir is as a lure to all the birds of prey round about to seize on him if he be not the better established in years and judgement likewise glorious gifts and foundations are like sacrifices without salt and but the painted sepulchres of alms which soon will putrefy and corrupt inwardly therefore measure not thine advancements by quantity but frame them by measure and defer not charities till death for certainly if a man weigh it rightly he that doth so is rather liberal of another than of his own

 return of the jedi 
 v 
 
 the trees of endor stood a thousand feet tall their trunks covered with shaggy rustbark rose straight as a pillar some of them as big around as a house some thin as aleg their foliage was spindly but lush in color scattering the sunlight in patterns over the forest floor 
 distributed thickly among these ancient giants was the usual array of of several species various deciduous forms variously gnarled and groundcover was primarily fern but so dense in spots as to resemble a gentlegreen sea that rippled softly in the forest breeze 
 this was the entire moon verdant primeval silent light filtered through thesheltering branches like golden ichor as if the very air were alive it was warm andit was cool this was endor 
 the stolen imperial shuttle sat in a clearing many miles from the imperiallanding port camouflaged with a blanket of dead branches leaves and mulch inaddition the little ship was thoroughly dwarfed by the towering trees its steely hullmight have looked incongruous here had it not been so totally inconspicuous 
 on the hill adjacent to the clearing the rebel contingent was just beginning tomake its way up a steep trail leia chewie han and luke led the way followed insingle file by the raggedy helmeted squad of the strike team this unit wascomposed of elite groundfighters of the rebel alliance a scruffy bunch in someways each been for initiative cunning and ferocity some weretrained commandos some paroled they all hated the empire with apassion that exceeded and they all knew this was the crucial they failed to destroy the shield generator here the rebellion was doomed nosecond chances 
 consequently no one had tell them to be alert as they made their way silently upthe forest path they were every on more alert than they had ever been 
 and brought up the rear of brigade domedpates swiveled round and round as he went blinking his sensor lights at theinfinitely tall trees which surrounded them 
 he commented to threepio 
 no i think pretty here his golden companion replied testily withour luck inhabited solely by monsters 
 the trooper just ahead of threepio turned around and gave them a 
 threepio turned back to artoo and whispered quiet artoo 
 they were all a bit nervous 
 up ahead chewie and leia reached the crest of the hill they dropped to theground crawled the last few feet and peered over the edge chewbacca raised hisfeet and peered over the edge chewbacca raised his great paw signaling the rest ofthe group to stop all at once the forest seemed to become much more silent 
 luke and han crawled forward on their bellies to view what the others wereobserving pointing through the ferns chewie and leia cautioned stealth not farbelow in a glen beside a clear pool two imperial scouts had set up temporary were fixing a meal of rations and were preoccupied warming it over a portablecooker two speeder bikes were parked nearby 
 should we try to go around whispered leia 
 take time luke shook his head 
 han peeked from behind a rock yeah and if they catch sight of us and whole for nothing 
 is it just the two of them leia still sounded skeptical 
 take a look smiled luke with a sigh of tension about to be released theyall responded with a similar grin it was beginning 
 leia motioned the rest of the squad to remain where they were then she and chewbacca quietly edged closer to the scout camp 
 when they were quite near the clearing but still covered by underbrush soloslid quickly to the lead position stay here he rasped chewie and i will takecare of this he flashed them his most roguish smile 
 quietly warned luke there might be 
 but before he could finish han jumped up with his furry partner and rushed intothe clearing 
 more out there luke finished speaking to himself he looked over at leia 
 she shrugged you expect some things never changed 
 before luke could respond though they were distracted by a loud commotion inthe glen they flattened to the ground and watched 
 han was engaged in a rousing fist fight with one of the lookedso happy in days the other scout jumped on his speeder bike to escape but bythe time ignited the engines chewie was able to get off a few shots from hiscrossbow laser the scout crashed instantly against an enormous tree abrief muffled explosion followed 
 leia drew her laser pistol and raced into the battle zone followed closely byluke as soon as they were running clear though several large laser blasts went offall around them tumbling them to the ground leia lost her gun 
 dazed they both looked up to see two more imperial scouts emerge from the farside of the clearing heading for their speeder bikes hidden in the peripheral scouts holstered their pistols as they mounted the bikes and fired up the engines 
 leia staggered to her feet over there two more of them 
 i see em answered luke rising stay here 
 but leia had ideas of her own she ran to the remaining rocket it up and took off in pursuit of the fleeing scouts as she tore past luke hejumped up behind her on the bike and off the flew 
 quick center switch he shouted to her over her shoulder over the roar of therocket engines jam their comlinks 
 as luke and leia soared out of the clearing after the imperials han and chewiewere just subduing the last scout hey wait solo shouted but they were threw his weapon to the ground in frustration and the rest of the rebel commandosquad poured over the rise into the clearing 
 luke and leia sped through the dense foliage a few feet off the ground leia atthe controls luke grabbing on behind her the two escaping imperial scouts had agood lead but at two hundred miles per hour leia was the better talent ranin her family 
 she let off a burst from the laser cannon periodically but was still toofar behind to be very accurate the explosions hit away from the moving trees and setting the shrubbery afire as the bikes weaved in and outbetween massive imposing branches 
 move closer luke shouted 
 leia opened the throttle closed the gap the two scouts sensed their pursuergaining and recklessly veered this way and that skimming through a narrow openingbetween two trees one of the bikes scraped the bark tipping the scout almost out ofcontrol slowing him significantly 
 get alongside luke yelled into ear 
 she pulled her speeder so close to the their steering vanes scrapedhideously against each other luke suddenly leaped from the back of bike tothe back of the grabbed the imperial warrior around the neck and flipped himoff the trooper smashed into a thick trunk with a and settled forever into the sea of ferns 
 luke scooted forward to the seat of the speeder bike played with thecontrols a few seconds and lurched forward following leia pulled two of them now tore after the remaining scout 
 over hill and under stonebridge they flew narrowly avoiding collision flamingdry vines in their afterburn the chase swung north and passed a gully where twomore imperial scouts were resting a moment later they swung into pursuit nowhot on luke and tail blasting away with laser cannon luke still behind leiatook a glancing blow 
 keep on that one he shouted up at her indicating the scout in the lead the two behind us 
 leia shot ahead luke at the same instant flared up his retrorocket slammingthe bike into rapid deceleration the two scouts on his tail zipped past him in a bluron either side unable to slow their momentum luke immediately roared into highvelocity again firing with his blasters suddenly in pursuit of his pursuers 
 his third round hit its mark one of the scouts blown out of control wentspinning against a boulder in a rumble of flame 
 the cohort took a single glance at the flash and put his bike intosupercharge mode speeding even faster luke kept pace 
 far ahead leia and the first scout continued their own slalomthrough the barricades of impassive trunks and branches she had tobrake through so many turns in fact leia seemed unable to draw any closer to herquarry suddenly she shot into the air at an unbelievably steep incline and quicklyvanished from sight 
 the scout turned in confusion uncertain whether to relax or cringe at sudden disappearance her whereabouts became clear soon enough outof the leia dove down on him cannon blasting from above the took the shock wave from a near hit her speed was even greater than and in a moment she was racing alongside him but before she knewwhat was happening he reached down and drew a handgun from his she could react he fired 
 her bike spun out of control she jumped free just in speederexploded on a giant tree as leia rolled clear into a tangle of matted vines rotting water the last thing she saw was the orange fireball through a cloud ofsmoking greenery and then blackness 
 the scout looked behind him at the explosion with a satisfied sneer when hefaced forward again though the smug look faded for he was on a collision coursewith a fallen tree in a moment it was all over but the flaming 
 meanwhile luke was closing fast on the last scout as they wove from tree totree luke eased up behind and then drew even with the imperial rider the fleeingsoldier suddenly swerved slamming his bike into both tippedprecariously barely missing a large fallen trunk in their path the scout zoomedunder it luke over when he came down on the other side he crashed directlyon top of the vehicle their steering vanes locked 
 the bikes were shaped more or less like sleds with long thin rodsextending from their snouts and fluttery ailerons for guidance at the tip of the these vanes locked the bikes flew as one though either rider could steer 
 the scout banked hard right to try to smash luke into an onrushing grove ofsaplings on the right but at the last second luke leaned all his weight left turningthe locked speeders actually horizontal with luke on top the scout on the bottom 
 the biker scout suddenly stopped resisting leftward leaning and threw hisown weight in the same direction resulting in the bikes flipping over three hundredsixty degrees and coming to rest exactly upright once morebut with an enormoustree looming immediately in front of luke 
 without thinking he leaped from his bike a fraction of a second later thescout veered steeply steering vanes riderless speedercrashed explosively into the redwood 
 luke rolled decelerating up a slope the scout swooped around and came looking for him 
 luke stumbled out of the bushes as the speeder was bearing down on him fullthrottle laser cannon firing luke ignited his lightsaber and stood his ground hisweapon deflected every bolt the scout fired at luke but the bike kept coming in afew moments the two would meet the bike accelerated even more intent on bodilyslicing the young jedi in half at the last moment though luke perfect timing like a master matador facing a a singlemighty slash of his lightsaber 
 the bike quickly began to shudder then pitch and roll in a second it was outof control entirely and in another second it was a rumbling billow of fire on the forestfloor 
 luke snuffed out his lightsaber and headed back to join the others 
 shuttle swung around the unfinished portion of the death star and settledfluidly into the main docking bay soundless bearings lowered the dark were his feet as they glided down the chilly steel chill with purpose werehis strides and swift 
 the main corridor was filled with courtiers all awaiting an audience with theemperor vader curled his lip at all pompous toadys in their velvetrobes and painted faces perfumed bishops passing notes and passing judgmentsamong who else cared oily bent low from theweight of jewelry still warm from a previous dying flesh easy violent menand women lusting to be tampered with 
 vader had no patience for such petty filth he passed them without a many of them would have paid dearly for felicitous glance from the high darklord 
 when he reached the elevator to the tower he found the door heavily armed royal guards flanked the shaft seemingly unaware presence out of the shadow an officer stepped forward directly in path preventing his further approach 
 you may not enter the officer said evenly 
 vader did not waste words he raised his hand fingers outstretched toward throat ineffably the officer began to choke his knees started face turned ashen 
 gasping for air he spoke again it is 
 like a spring vader released the man from his remote grip the again sank to the floor trembling he rubbed his neck gently 
 i will await his convenience vader said he turned and looked out of theview window endor glowed there floating black space almost as if itwere radiant from some internal source of energy he felt its pull like a magnet likea vacuum like a torch in dead night 
 han and chewie crouched opposite each other in the forest clearing being near the rest of the strike squad much as was around them in groups of twos and threes they all waited 
 even threepio was silent he sat beside artoo polishing his fingers for lack ofanything better to do the others checked their watches or their weapons as theafternoon sunlight ticked away 
 artoo sat unmoving except for the little radar screen that stuck out the top of hisblue and silver dome revolving scanning the forest he exuded the calm patienceof a utilized function a program being run 
 suddenly he beeped 
 threepio ceased his obsessive polishing and looked apprehensively into theforest coming he translated 
 the rest of the squad faced out weapons were raised a twig cracked beyondthe western perimeter no one breathed 
 with a weary stride luke stepped out of the foliage into the clearing allrelaxed lowered their guns luke was tired to care he plopped down on the harddirt beside solo and lay back with an exhausted groan 
 hard day huh kid han commented 
 luke sat up on one elbow smiling it seemed like an awful lot of effort andnoise just to nail a couple of imperial scouts and they even gotten to the reallytough part yet but han could still maintain his light tone it was a state of particular brand of charm luke hoped it never vanished from the we get to that generator he retorted in kind 
 solo looked around into the forest luke had just come from leia 
 face suddenly turned to one of concern she come back 
 i thought she was with you voice marginally rose in pitch and volume 
 we got split up luke explained he exchanged a grim look with solo thenboth of them slowly stood we better look for her 
 you want to rest a while han suggested he could see the fatigue face and wanted to spare him for the coming confrontation which wouldsurely take more strength than any of them had 
 i want to find leia he said softly 
 han nodded without argument he signaled to the rebel officer who wassecond in command of the strike squad the officer ran up and saluted 
 take the squad ahead ordered solo rendezvous at the shieldgenerator at 
 the officer saluted again and immediately organized the troops within aminute they were filing silently into the forest greatly relieved to be moving at last 
 luke chewbacca general solo and the two droids faced in the oppositedirection artoo led the way his revolving scanner sensing for all the parametersthat described his mistress and the others followed him into the woods 
 the first thing leia was aware of was her left elbow it was wet it was lyingin a pool of water getting quite soaked 
 she moved the elbow out of the water with a little splash revealing somethingelse in her entire arm when it moved for the time being she decided tokeep it still 
 the next thing to enter her consciousness were sounds the splash her elbowhad made the rustle of leaves an occasional bird chirp forest sounds with agrunt she took a short breath and noted the grunting sound 
 smells began to fill her nostrils next humid mossy smells leafy oxygen odor of a distant honey the vapor of rare flowers 
 taste came with taste of blood on her tongue she opened andclosed her mouth a few times to localize where the blood was coming from but instead the attempt only brought the recognition of new herhead in her neck in her back she started to move her arms again but this entaileda whole catalogue of new pains so once again she rested 
 next she allowed temperature to waft into her sensorium sun warmed thefingers of her right hand while the palm in shadow stayed cool a breeze draftedthe back of her legs her left hand pressed against the skin of her belly was warm 
 she feltawake 
 actually to witness the damage since seeing things made themreal and seeing her own broken body was not a reality she wanted she opened her eyes things were blurry here at ground browns and grays in the foreground becoming progressively brighter andgreener in the distance slowly things came into focus 
 slowly she saw the ewok 
 a strange small furry creature he stood three feet from face and no morethan three feet tall he had large dark curious brownish eyes and stubby completely covered head to foot with soft brown fur he looked likenothing so much as the stuffed baby wookiee doll leia remembered playing with as achild in face when he first saw the creature standing before her she thought itmerely a dream a childhood memory rising out of her addled brain 
 but this a dream it was an ewok and his name was wicket 
 now was he exclusively as leia focused further she could see a knifestrapped to his waist it was all he wore save for a thing leather mantle onlycovering his head 
 they watched each other unmoving for a long minute the ewok seemedpuzzled by the princess uncertain of what she was or what she intended at themoment leia intended to see if she could sit up 
 she sat up with a groan 
 the sound apparently frightened the little fluffball he rapidly stumbledbackward tripped and fell eeeeep he squeaked 
 leia scrutinized herself closely looking for signs of serious damage herclothes were torn she had cuts bruises and scrapes nothing seemedto be broken or irreparable on the other hand she had no idea where she groaned again 
 that did it for the ewok he jumped up grabbed a spear andheld it defensively in her direction warily he circled poking the pointed javelin ather clearly more fearful than aggressive 
 hey cut that out leia brushed the weapon away with annoyance that wasall she needed be skewered by a teddy bear more gently she not going to hurt you 
 gingerly she stood up testing her legs the ewok backed away with caution 
 be afraid leia tried to put reassurance into her voice i just want tosee what happened to my bike here she knew the more she talked in this tone themore at ease it would put the little creature moreover she knew if she was was doing okay 
 her legs were a little unsteady but she was able to walk slowly over to thecharred remains of the speeder now lying in a pile at the base of thepartially blackened tree 
 her movement was away from the ewok who like a skittish puppy took this asa safe sign and followed her to the wreckage leia picked the imperial laserpistol off the ground it was all that was left of him 
 i think i got off at the right time she muttered 
 the ewok appraised the scene with his big shiny eyes nodded shook his squeaked vociferously for several seconds 
 leia looked all around her at the dense forest then sat down with a sigh on afallen log she was at with the ewok now and they once again regardedeach other a little concerned trouble is sort of stuck here she i even know where here is 
 she put her head in her hands partly to mull over the situation partly to rubsome of the soreness from her temples wicket sat down beside her and mimickedher posture in paws elbows on let out a little sympatheticewok sigh 
 leia laughed appreciatively and scratched the small furry the ears he purred like a kitten 
 you happen to have a comlink on you by any chance she hoped maybe talking about it would give her an idea the ewokblinked a few he only gave her a mystified look leia smiled no iguess not 
 suddenly wicket froze his ears twitched and he sniffed the air he tilted hishead in an attitude of keen attention 
 what is it leia whispered something was obviously amiss then sheheard it a quiet snap in the bushes beyond a tentative rustling 
 all at once the ewok let out a loud terrified screech leia drew her behind the log wicket scurried beside her and squeezed under it a longsilence followed tense uncertain leia trained her senses on the near to fight 
 for all her readiness she expected the laser bolt to come from where off to the right it exploded in front of the log with a shower of light andpine needles she returned the fire short just as quicklysensed something behind her slowly she swiveled to find an imperial scoutstanding over her his weapon leveled at her head he reached out his hand for thepistol she held 
 take that he ordered 
 without warning a furry hand came out from under the log and jabbed the scoutin the leg with a knife the man howled in pain began jumping about on one foot 
 leia dove for his fallen laser pistol she rolled fired and hit the scout squarelyin the chest his heart 
 quickly the forest was quiet once more the noise and light swallowed up as ifthey had never been leia lay still where she was panting softly waiting for anotherattack none came 
 wicket poked his fuzzy head up from under the log and looked around eeeprrp scrp ooooh he mumbled in a tone of awe 
 leia hopped up ran all about the area crouched turned her head from side toside it seemed safe for the time being she motioned to her chubby new on better get out of here 
 as they moved into the thick flora wicket took the lead leia was unsure atfirst but he shrieked urgently at her and tugged her sleeve so she relinquishedcontrol to the odd little beast and followed him 
 she cast her mind adrift for a while letting her feet carry her nimbly alongamong the gargantuan trees she was struck suddenly not by the smallness of theewok who guided her but by her own smallness next to these trees they were tenthousand years old some of them and tall beyond sight they were temples to she championed they reached out to the rest of the universe she feltherself part of their greatness but also dwarfed by it 
 and lonely she felt lonely here in this forest of giants all her life among giants of her own people her father the great senator organa hermother then minister of education her peers and friends giants all 
 but these trees they were like mighty exclamation points announcing theirown preeminence they were here they were older than time they would behere long after leia was gone after the rebellion after the empire 
 and then she feel lonely again but felt a part again of these beings a part of them across time and space connected by the vibrant vitalforce of which 
 it was confusing a part and apart she grasp it she felt large andsmall brave and timid she felt like a tiny creative spark dancing about in the firesof lifedancing behind a furtive pudgy midget bear who kept beckoning her deeperinto the woods 
 it was this then that the alliance was fighting to creatures inmammoth forests helping scared brave princesses to safety leia wished her parentswere alive so she could tell them 
 lord vader stepped out of the elevator and stood at the entrance to the throneroom the hummed either side of the shaft casting an eerie glow on theroyal guards who waited there he marched resolutely down the walkway up thestairs and paused subserviently behind the throne he kneeled motionless 
 almost immediately he heard the voice rise rise and friend 
 vader rose as the throne swiveled around and the emperor faced him 
 they made eye contact from and a breath away across thatabyss vader responded my master a small rebel force has penetrated the shieldand landed on endor 
 yes i know there was no hint of surprise in his tone rather fulfillment 
 vader noted this then went on my son is with them 
 the brow furrowed less than a millimeter his voice remained slightly curious are you sure 
 i felt him my master it was almost a taunt he knew the emperor wasfrightened of young skywalker afraid of his power only together could vader andthe emperor hope to pull the jedi knight over to the dark side he said it his own singularity i felt him 
 strange that i have not the emperor murmured his eyes becoming both knew the force no one was infallible with its had everything to do with awareness with vision certainly vader and his sonwere more closely linked than was the emperor with young inaddition the emperor was now aware of a crosscurrent he read before abuckle in the force he quite understand i wonder if your feelings on thismatter are clear lord vader 
 they are clear my master he knew his presence it galled him andfueled him and lured him and howled in a voice of its own then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him emperor palpatinesaid simply as long as things were clear things were clear 
 he will come to me vader asked skeptically this was not what he felt hefelt drawn 
 of his own free will the emperor assured him it must be of his own freewill else all was lost a spirit could not be coerced into corruption it had to beseduced it had to participate activity it had to crave luke skywalker knewthese things and still he circled the black fire like a cat destinies could never beread with absolute skywalker would come that was clear i haveforeseen it his compassion for you will be his undoing compassion had alwaysbeen the weak belly of the jedi and forever would be it was the ultimatevulnerability the emperor had none the boy will come to you and you willthen bring him before me 
 vader bowed low as you wish 
 with casual malice the emperor dismissed the dark lord with grimanticipation vader strode out of the throne room to board the shuttle for endor 
 luke chewie han and threepio picked their way methodically through theundergrowth behind artoo whose antenna continued to revolve it was remarkablethe way the little droid was able to blaze a trail over jungle terrain like this but he didit without fuss the miniature cutting tools on his walkers and dome slicing neatlythrough anything too dense to push out of the way 
 artoo suddenly stopped causing some consternation on the part of his radar screen spun faster he clicked and whirred to himself then darted forwardwith an excited announcement vrrr deep dwp booooo dwee op 
 threepio raced behind him artoo says the rocket bikes are right 
 they broke into the clearing just ahead of the others but all stopped in a clumpon entering the charred debris of three speeder bikes was strewn around to mention the remains of some imperial scouts 
 they spread out to inspect the rubble little of note was evident except a tornpiece of jacket han held it soberly thinking 
 threepio spoke quietly sensor find no other trace of princess leia 
 i hope nowhere near here now han said to the trees he want toimagine her loss after all that had happened he simply believe it wouldend this way for her 
 looks like she ran into two of them luke said just to say something noneof them wanted to draw any conclusions 
 she seems to have done all right han responded somewhat tersely he wasaddressing luke but speaking to himself 
 only chewbacca seemed uninterested in the clearing in which they werestanding he stood facing the dense foliage beyond then wrinkled his nose sniffing 
 rahrr he shouted plunging into the thicket the others rushed after him 
 artoo whistled softly nervously 
 picking up what threepio snapped try to be more specific would you 
 the trees became significantly taller as the group pushed on not that it waspossible to see any higher but the girth of the trunks was increasingly massive therest of the forest was thinning a bit in the process making passage easier but givingthem the distinct sense that they were shrinking it was an ominous feeling 
 all at once the undergrowth gave way again to yet another open space at thecenter of this clearing a huge several shanks of raw meat the searchers stared thencautiously walked to the stake 
 this threepio voiced the collective question 
 nose was going wild in some kind of olfactory delirium he heldhimself back as long as he could but was finally unable to resist he reached out forone of the slabs of meat 
 no wait shouted luke 
 but it was too late the moment the meat was pulled from the stake a huge netsprang up all around the adventurers instantly hoisting them high above the a twisting jumble of arms and legs 
 artoo whistled was programmed to hate being thewookiee bayed his regret 
 han peeled a hairy paw away from his mouth spitting fur great work always thinking with your stomach 
 take it easy called luke just figure out how to get out of this tried but was unable to free his arms one locked behind him through the net onepinned to leg can anyone reach my lightsaber 
 artoo was bottommost he extended his cutting appendage and began clippingthe loops of the vinery net 
 solo meantime was trying to squeeze his arm past threepio trying to stretch toreach the lightsaber hanging at waist they settled jerkily as artoo cutthrough another piece of mesh leaving han pressed face to face with the protocoldroid 
 out of the way off of 
 how do you think i feel threepio charged there was no protocol in asituation like this 
 i really han began but suddenly artoo cut through the last link andthe entire group crashed out of the net to the ground as they gradually regainedtheir senses sat up checked to make certain the others were all safe one by one theyrealized they were surrounded by twenty furry little creatures all wearing soft leatherhoods or caps all brandishing spears 
 one came close to han pushing a long spear in his face screeching eeee wk 
 solo knocked the weapon aside with a curt directive point that thingsomewhere else 
 a second ewok became alarmed and lunged at han again he deflected thespear but in the process got cut on the arm 
 luke reached for his lightsaber but just then a third ewok ran forward pushingthe more aggressive ones out of the way and shrieked a long string of seeminginvective at them in a decidedly scolding tone at this luke decided to hold off onhis lightsaber 
 han was wounded and angry though he started to holster with a be all right he added never confuse ability with appearance benused to tell actions with motivations luke was uncertain of these littlefurries but he had a feeling 
 han held his arm and held his peace as the ewoks swarmed all their weapons luke even relinquished his lightsaber chewiegrowled suspiciously 
 artoo and threepio were just extracting themselves from the collapsed net asthe ewoks chattered excitedly to each other 
 luke turned to the gold droid threepio can you understand what 
 threepio rose from the mesh trap feeling himself for dents or rattles oh myhead he complained 
 at the sight of his fully upright body the ewoks began squeaking amongthemselves pointing and gesticulating 
 threepio spoke to the one who appeared to be the leader chree breeb a shurrdu 
 bloh wreee dbleeop weeschhreee answered the fuzzy beast 
 du wee sheess 
 reeop glwah wrrripsh

 suddenly one of the ewoks dropped his spear with a little gasp and prostratedhimself before the shiny droid in another moment all the ewoks followed looked at his friends with a slightly embarrassed shrug 
 chewie let out a puzzled bark artoo whirred speculatively luke and hanregarded the battalion of kowtowing ewoks in wonder 
 then at some invisible signal from one of their group the small creatures beganto chant in unison eekee whoh eekee whoh rheakee rheekee whoh 
 han looked at threepio with total disbelief you say to them 
 hello i think threepio replied almost apologetically he hastened to could be mistaken using a very primitive dialecti believe they think sort of god 
 chewbacca and artoo thought that was very funny they spent several secondshysterically barking and whistling before they finally managed to quiet had to wipe a tear from his eye 
 han just shook his head with a look of patience well howabout using your diving influence to get us out of this he suggested solicitously 
 threepio pulled himself up to his full height and spoke with unrelentingdecorum i beg your pardon captain solo but that be proper 
 proper solo roared he always knew this pompous droid was going to gotoo far with him one this might well be the day 
 against my programming to impersonate a deity he replied to solo as ifnothing so obvious needed explanation 
 han moved threateningly toward the protocol droid his fingers itching to pull aplug listen you pile of bolts if you he got no farther as fifteen ewokspears were thrust menacingly in his face just kidding he smiled affably 
 the procession of ewoks wound its way slowly into the somber creatures inching through a maze the sun had nearlyset now and the long shadows made the cavernous domain even moreimposing than before yet the ewoks seemed well at home turning down eachdense corridor of vines with precision 
 on their shoulders they carried their four chewbacca to long poles wrapped around and around with vines immobilizing themas if they were wriggling larvae in coarse leafy cocoons 
 behind the captives threepio borne on a of branches in theshape of a carried high upon the shoulders of the lowly ewoks like aroyal potentate he perused the mighty forest through which they carried lavender sunset glowing between the vinery the exotic flowers starting toclose the ageless trees the glistening knew that no one before him hadever appreciated these things in just precisely the manner he was now no one elsehad his sensors his circuits his programs his memory so in some realway he was the creator of this little universe its images and colors

 kutuzov fell back toward vienna destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn at braunau and traun near linz on october the russian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russian baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge 
 it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and then suddenly spread out in the sunlight objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down below the little town could be seen with its white houses its cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an island and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the danube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns the horse patrols could be discerned 
 among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through his fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on their knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass 
 yes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool a fine place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitski was saying 
 thank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance a lovely place we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendid house 
 look prince said another who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside see our infantrymen have already got there look there in the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval 
 so they will said nesvitski no but what i should like added he munching a pie in his handsome mouth would be to slip in over there 
 he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed and gleamed 
 that would be fine gentlemen 
 the officers laughed 
 just to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girls among them on my word give five years of my life for it 
 they must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers laughing 
 meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general who looked through his field glass 
 yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is be fired on at the crossing and why are they dawdling there 
 on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from their battery a cloud arose then came the distant report of a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing 
 nesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling 
 would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said 
 a bad business said the general without answering him our men have been wasting time 
 i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitski 
 yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected 
 very good answered nesvitski 
 he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle 
 really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill 
 now then see how far it will carry captain just try said the general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the time 
 crew to your guns commanded the officer 
 in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading 
 one came the command 
 number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke showing the spot where it burst 
 the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly visible as if but a throw away and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression

 chapter 
 
 for some days after that evening mr heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals yet he would not consent formally to exclude hareton and cathy he had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings choosing rather to absent himself and eating once in hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him 
 one night after the family were in bed i heard him go downstairs and out at the front door i did not hear him and in the morning i found he was still away we were in april then the weather was sweet and warm the grass as green as showers and sun could make it and the two dwarf apple trees near the southern wall in full bloom after breakfast catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir trees at the end of the house and she beguiled hareton who had perfectly recovered from his accident to dig and arrange her little garden which was shifted to that corner by the influence of complaints i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around and the beautiful soft blue overhead when my young lady who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border returned only half laden and informed us that mr heathcliff was coming in and he spoke to me she added with a perplexed countenance 
 what did he say asked hareton 
 he told me to begone as fast as i could she answered but he looked so different from his usual look that i stopped a moment to stare at him 
 how he inquired 
 why almost bright and cheerful no almost much excited and wild and glad she replied 
 night walking amuses him then i remarked affecting a careless manner in reality as surprised as she was and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master looking glad would not be an everyday spectacle i framed an excuse to go in heathcliff stood at the open door he was pale and he trembled yet certainly he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes that altered the aspect of his whole face 
 will you have some breakfast i said you must be hungry rambling about all night i wanted to discover where he had been but i did not like to ask directly 
 no not hungry he answered averting his head and speaking rather contemptuously as if he guessed i was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour 
 i felt perplexed i know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition 
 i think it right to wander out of doors i observed instead of being in bed it is not wise at any rate this moist season i dare say catch a bad cold or a fever you have something the matter with you now 
 nothing but what i can bear he replied and with the greatest pleasure provided leave me alone get in and annoy me 
 i obeyed and in passing i noticed he breathed as fast as a cat 
 yes i reflected to myself we shall have a fit of illness i cannot conceive what he has been doing 
 that noon he sat down to dinner with us and received a plate from my hands as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting 
 neither cold nor fever nelly he remarked in allusion to my speech and ready to do justice to the food you give me 
 he took his knife and fork and was going to commence eating when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct he laid them on the table looked eagerly towards the window then rose and went out we saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal and earnshaw said go and ask why he would not dine he thought we had grieved him some way 
 well is he coming cried catherine when her cousin returned 
 nay he answered but not angry he seemed rare and pleased indeed only i made him impatient by speaking to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wondered how i could want the company of anybody else 
 i set his plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he when the room was clear in no degree calmer the same was of joy under his black brows the same bloodless hue and his teeth visible now and then in a kind of smile his frame shivering not as one shivers with chill or weakness but as a cord strong thrilling rather than trembling 
 i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should and i exclaimed 
 have you heard any good news mr heathcliff you look uncommonly animated 
 where should good news come from to me he said animated with hunger and seemingly i must not eat 
 your dinner is here i returned why you get it 
 i want it now he muttered hastily wait till supper and nelly once for all let me beg you to warn hareton and the other away from me i wish to be troubled by nobody i wish to have this place to myself 
 is there some new reason for this banishment i inquired tell me why you are so queer mr heathcliff where were you last night not putting the question through idle curiosity but 
 you are putting the question through very idle curiosity he interrupted with a laugh yet answer it last night i was on the threshold of hell today i am within sight of my heaven i have my eyes on it hardly three feet to sever me and now better go neither see nor hear anything to frighten you if you refrain from prying 
 having swept the hearth and wiped the table i departed more perplexed than ever 
 he did not quit the house again that afternoon and no one intruded on his solitude till at eight i deemed it proper though unsummoned to carry a candle and his supper to him he was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice but not looking out his face was turned to the interior gloom the fire had smouldered to ashes the room was filled with the damp mild air of the cloudy evening and so still that not only the murmur of the beck down gimmerton was distinguishable but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles or through the large stones which it could not cover i uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate and commenced shutting the casements one after another till i came to his 
 must i close this i asked in order to rouse him for he would not stir 
 the light flashed on his features as i spoke oh mr lockwood i cannot express what a terrible start i got by the momentary view those deep black eyes that smile and ghastly paleness it appeared to me not mr heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candle bend towards the wall and it left me in darkness 
 yes close it he replied in his familiar voice there that is pure awkwardness why did you hold the candle horizontally be quick and bring another 
 i hurried out in a foolish state of dread and said to joseph the master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire 
 for i dare not go in myself again just then 
 joseph rattled some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immediately with the supper tray in his other hand explaining that mr heathcliff was going to bed and he wanted nothing to eat till morning we heard him mount the stairs directly he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber but turned into that with the panelled bed its window as i mentioned before is wide enough for anybody to get through and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion of which he had rather we had no suspicion 
 is he a ghoul or a vampire i mused i had read of such hideous incarnate demons and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy and watched him grow to youth and followed him almost through his whole course and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror but where did he come from the little dark thing harboured by a good man to his bane muttered superstition as i dozed into unconsciousness and i began half dreaming to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him and repeating my waking meditations i tracked his existence over again with grim variations at last picturing his death and funeral of which all i can remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument and consulting the sexton about it and as he had no surname and we could not tell his age we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word heathcliff that came true we were if you enter the kirkyard read on his headstone only that and the date of his death 
 dawn restored me to common sense i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window there were none he has stayed at and be all right today i prepared breakfast for the household as was my usual custom but told hareton and catherine to get theirs ere the master came down for he lay late they preferred taking it out of doors under the trees and i set a little table to accommodate them 
 on my i found mr heathcliff below he and joseph were conversing about some farming business he gave clear minute directions concerning the matter discussed but he spoke rapidly and turned his head continually aside and had the same excited expression even more exaggerated when joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose and i put a basin of coffee before him he drew it nearer and then rested his arms on the table and looked at the opposite wall as i supposed surveying one particular portion up and down with glittering restless eyes and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together 
 come now i exclaimed pushing some bread against his hand eat and drink that while it is hot it has been waiting near an hour 
 he notice me and yet he smiled rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so 
 mr heathcliff master i cried for sake stare as if you saw an unearthly vision 
 for sake shout so loud he replied turn round and tell me are we by ourselves 
 of course was my answer of course we are 
 still i involuntarily obeyed him as if i were not quite sure with a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things and leant forward to gaze more at his ease 
 now i perceived he was not looking at the wall for when i regarded him alone it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards distance and whatever it was it communicated apparently both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes at least the anguished yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested that idea the fancied object was not fixed either his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence and even in speaking to me were never weaned away i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread his fingers clenched before they reached it and remained on the table forgetful of their aim 
 i sat a model of patience trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation till he grew irritable and asking why i would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals and saying that on the next occasion i wait i might set the things down and go having uttered these words he left the house slowly sauntered down the garden path and disappeared through the gate 
 the hours crept anxiously by another evening came i did not retire to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he returned after midnight and instead of going to bed shut himself into the room beneath i listened and tossed about and finally dressed and descended it was too irksome to lie up there harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings 
 i distinguished mr step restlessly measuring the floor and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration resembling a groan he muttered detached words also the only one i could catch was the name of catherine coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering and spoken as one would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of his soul i had not courage to walk straight into the apartment but i desired to divert him from his reverie and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire stirred it and began to scrape the cinders it drew him forth sooner than i expected he opened the door immediately and said 
 nelly come it morning come in with your light 
 it is striking four i answered you want a candle to take upstairs you might have lit one at this fire 
 no i wish to go upstairs he said come in and kindle me a fire and do anything there is to do about the room 
 i must blow the coals red first before i can carry any i replied getting a chair and the bellows 
 he roamed to and fro meantime in a state approaching distraction his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between 
 when day breaks send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiries of him while i can bestow a thought on those matters and while i can act calmly i have not written my will yet and how to leave my property i cannot determine i wish i could annihilate it from the face of the earth 
 i would not talk so mr heathcliff i interposed let your will be a while be spared to repent of your many injustices yet i never expected that your nerves would be disordered they are at present marvellously so however and almost entirely through your own fault the way passed these three last days might knock up a titan do take some food and some repose you need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both your cheeks are hollow and your eyes bloodshot like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep 
 it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he replied i assure you it is through no settled designs do both as soon as i possibly can but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within length of the shore i must reach it first and then rest well never mind mr green as to repenting of my injustices done no injustice and i repent of nothing too happy and yet not happy enough my bliss kills my body but does not satisfy itself 
 happy master i cried strange happiness if you would hear me without being angry i might offer some advice that would make you happier 
 what is that he asked give it 
 you are aware mr heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish unchristian life and probably hardly had a bible in your hands during all that period you must have forgotten the contents of the book and you may not have space to search it now could it be hurtful to send for minister of any denomination it does not matter explain it and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts and how unfit you will be for its heaven unless a change takes place before you die 
 rather obliged than angry nelly he said for you remind me of the manner that i desire to be buried in it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening you and hareton may if you please accompany me and mind particularly to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins no minister need come nor need anything be said over tell you i have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncovered by me 
 and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast and died by that means and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk i said shocked at his godless indifference how would you like it 
 they do that he replied if they did you must have me removed secretly and if you neglect it you shall prove practically that the dead are not annihilated 
 as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den and i breathed freer but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the house he wanted somebody with him i declined telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone 
 i believe you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh something too horrible to live under a decent roof then turning to catherine who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he added half you come chuck not hurt you no to you made myself worse than the devil well there is one who shrink from my company by god relentless oh damn it unutterably too much for flesh and blood to mine 
 he solicited the society of no one more at dusk he went into his chamber through the whole night and far into the morning we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself hareton was anxious to enter but i bade him fetch mr kenneth and he should go in and see him when he came and i requested admittance and tried to open the door i found it locked and heathcliff bid us be damned he was better and would be left alone so the doctor went away 
 the following evening was very wet indeed it poured down till and as i took my morning walk round the house i observed the window swinging open and the rain driving straight in he cannot be in bed i thought those showers would drench him through he must either be up or out but make no more ado go boldly and look 
 having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key i ran to unclose the panels for the chamber was vacant quickly pushing them aside i peeped in mr heathcliff was on his back his eyes met mine so keen and fierce i started and then he seemed to smile i could not think him dead but his face and throat were washed with rain the bedclothes dripped and he was perfectly still the lattice flapping to and fro had grazed one hand that rested on the sill no blood trickled from the broken skin and when i put my fingers to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark 
 i hasped the window i combed his black long hair from his forehead i tried to close his eyes to extinguish if possible that frightful lifelike gaze of exultation before anyone else beheld it they would not shut they seemed to sneer at my attempts and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too taken with another fit of cowardice i cried out for joseph joseph shuffled up and made a noise but resolutely refused to meddle with him 
 th harried off his soul he cried and he muh hev his carcass intuh t bargain for aw care ech what a wicked un he looks girning at death and the old sinner grinned in mockery i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed but suddenly composing himself he fell on his knees and raised his hands and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights 
 i felt stunned by the awful event and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness but poor hareton the most wronged was the only one that really suffered much he sat by the corpse all night weeping in bitter earnest he pressed its hand and kissed the sarcastic savage face that everyone else shrank from contemplating and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart though it be tough as tempered steel 
 mr kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days fearing it might lead to trouble and then i am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose it was the consequence of his strange illness not the cause 
 we buried him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wished earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carry the coffin comprehended the whole attendance the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave we stayed to see it covered hareton with a streaming face dug green sods and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly but the country folk if you ask them would swear on the bible that he walks there are those who speak to having met him near the church and on the moor and even in this house idle tales say and so say i yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago i was going to the grange one dark evening threatening just at the turn of the heights i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him he was crying terribly and i supposed the lambs were skittish and would not be guided 
 the matter my little man i asked 
 heathcliff and a woman yonder under t nab he blubbered un i darnut pass em 
 i saw nothing but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down he probably raised the phantoms from thinking as he traversed the moors alone on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat yet still i like being out in the dark now and i like being left by myself in this grim house i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the grange 
 they are going to the grange then i said 
 yes answered mrs dean is soon as they are married and that will be on new day 
 and who will live here then 
 why joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a lad to keep him company they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up 
 for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it i observed 
 no mr lockwood said nelly shaking her head i believe the dead are at peace but it is not right to speak of them with levity 
 at that moment the garden gate swung to the ramblers were returning 
 they are afraid of nothing i grumbled watching their approach through the window together they would brave satan and all his legions 
 as they stepped on to the doorstones and halted to take a last look at the more correctly at each other by her felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again and pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs dean and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his gay indiscretions had he not fortunately recognized me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet 
 my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk when beneath its walls i perceived decay had made progress even in seven months many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass and slates jutted off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms 
 i sought and soon discovered the three headstones on the slope next the moor the middle one grey and half buried in heath edgar only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot still bare 
 i lingered round them under that benign sky watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass and wondered how anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth

 chapter 
 
 
 though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort jo still found time for literary labors the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best she saw that money conferred power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than life 
 the dream of filling home with comforts giving beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years most cherished castle in the air 
 the experience had seemed to open a way which might after long traveling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chateau en espagne but the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the treasures if i remember rightly but the up again and take another spirit was as strong in jo as in jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags 
 she took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even america read rubbish she told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to mr dashwood editor of the weekly volcano she had never read sartor resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners so she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigar smoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance somewhat daunted by this reception jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment 
 excuse me i was looking for the weekly volcano office i wished to see mr dashwood 
 down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep feeling that she must get through the matter somehow jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion 
 a friend of mine desired me to as an like your glad to write more if this suits 
 while she blushed and blundered mr dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages 
 not a first attempt i take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a sign of a novice 
 no sir she has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the blarneystone banner 
 oh did she and mr dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots well you can leave it if you like more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but run my eye over it and give you an answer next week 
 now jo did not like to leave it for mr dashwood suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week 
 when she went again mr dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced mr dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and mr dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first 
 take this editors never say i if you object to a few alterations too long but omitting the passages marked will make it just the right said in a businesslike tone 
 jo hardly knew her own ms again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender patent might on being asked to cut off her legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral she had carefully put in as ballast for much been stricken out 
 but sir i thought every story should have some sort of a moral so i took care to have a few of my sinners repent 
 mr editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could 
 people want to be amused not preached at you know morals sell nowadays which was not quite a correct statement by the way 
 you think it would do with these alterations then 
 yes a new plot and pretty well worked good and so on was mr affable reply 
 what do is what compensation began jo not exactly knowing how to express herself 
 oh yes well we give from to thirty for things of this sort pay when it comes out returned mr dashwood as if that point had escaped him such trifles do escape the editorial mind it is said 
 very well you can have it said jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the work even seemed good pay 
 shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success 
 well look at it promise to take it tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral what name would your friend like to put on it in a careless tone 
 none at all if you please she wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said jo blushing in spite of herself 
 
 just as she likes of course the tale will be out next week will you call for the money or shall i send it asked mr dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be 
 call good morning sir 
 as she departed mr dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark poor and proud as usual but do 
 following mr directions and making mrs northbury her model jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking 
 like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and mr dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch 
 she soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home she had a feeling that father and mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories mr dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word 
 she thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her secret 
 but mr dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons she studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her she delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed she thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a character she was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us 
 she was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when jo most needed hers she got it 
 i know whether the study of shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections 
 mr bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied proceeding which would have much surprised him had he know it for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit 
 why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first he was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth he was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet everyone was his friend no longer young but as as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle if he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others the pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words 
 his very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable his apacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath his rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full his very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other 
 it said jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher who shoveled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of bhaer 
 jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the professor added much to her regard for him he never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him he never spoke of himself and in a conversation with miss norton divulged the pleasing fact from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr bhaer had never told it she felt proud to know that he was an honored professor in berlin though only a poor in america and his homely life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner miss norton had the entree into most society which jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her the solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on jo and the professor she took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities 
 jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off but her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance turning as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de staels of the age who looked daggers at another corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible the scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the british nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party 
 before the evening was half over jo felt so completely disillusioned that she sat down in a corner to recover herself mr bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess the conversations were miles beyond comprehension but she enjoyed it though kant and hegel were unknown gods the subjective and objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over it dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only god jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday 
 she looked round to see how the professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimest expression she had ever seen him wear he shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs 
 now mr bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken as he glanced from jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand 
 he bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of eloquence which made his broken english musical and his plain face beautiful he had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo the old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new god was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact she felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when mr bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him 
 she did neither but she remembered the scene and gave the professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent she began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and good will then her friend friedrich bhaer was not only good but great 
 this belief strengthened daily she valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near to losing everything it all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the professor came in to give jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head which tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off 
 evident he look in his glass before coming down thought jo with a smile as he said goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the death of wallenstein 
 she said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a german read schiller is rather an absorbing occupation after the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for jo was in a gay mood that night and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment the professor know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible 
 mees marsch for what do you laugh in your face haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad 
 how can i be respectful sir when you forget to take your hat off said jo 
 lifting his hand to his head the professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol 
 ah i see him now it is that imp tina who makes me a fool with my cap well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him 
 but the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because mr bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with great disgust i wish these papers did not come in the house they are not for children to see nor young people to read it is not well and i haf no patience with those who make this harm 
 jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villian and a viper she did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the volcano it was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied he knew that jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him he did not say to himself it is none of my business no right to say anything as many people would have done he only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from love and care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle all this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely 
 yes you are right to put it from you i do not think that good young girls should see such things they are made pleasant to some but i would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash 
 all may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it i see any harm in supplying it many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin 
 there is a demand for whisky but i think you and i do not care to sell it if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest they haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it no they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing 
 mr bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney 
 i should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the professor coming back with a relieved air 
 jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute then she thought consolingly to herself mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so i be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face shall we go on sir be very good and proper now 
 i shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words weekly volcano were printed in large type on her forehead 
 as soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories being a little shortsighted mr bhaer sometimes used eye glasses and jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book now she seemed to have on the mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay 
 they are trash and will soon be worse trash if i go on for each is more sensational than the last gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money i know so for i read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr bhaer got hold of them 
 jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze 
 yes the best place for such inflammable nonsense better burn the house down i suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the demon of the jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes 
 but when nothing remained of all her three work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages 
 i think i done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently i almost wish i any conscience so inconvenient if i care about doing right and feel uncomfortable when doing wrong i should get on capitally i help wishing sometimes that mother and father been so particular about such things 
 ah jo instead of wishing that thank god that father and mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood 
 jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of mrs sherwood miss edgeworth and hannah more and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it she had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century she sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with mr dashwood that morals sell 
 then she tried a story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it the only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief but much as she liked to write for children jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular sabbath school nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues so nothing came of these trials land jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility 
 i know anything wait until i do before i try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if i do better honest at least which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good 
 while these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but professor bhaer he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant 
 he helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons besides german and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life 
 it was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave mrs kirke till june everyone seemed sorry when the time came the children were inconsolable and mr hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind 
 going home ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening 
 she was going early so she bade them all goodbye overnight and when his turn came she said warmly now sir you forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you never forgive you if you do for i want them all to know my friend 
 do you shall i come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see 
 yes come next month laurie graduates then and enjoy commencement as something new 
 that is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone 
 yes my boy teddy very proud of him and should like you to see him 
 jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another something in mr face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew if it had not been for tina on her knee she know what would have become of her fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the professor did not see it but he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially 
 i fear i shall not make the time for that but i wish the friend much success and you all happiness gott bless you and with that he shook hands warmly shouldered tina and went away 
 but after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart once when he remembered jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find 
 it is not for me i must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan then as if reproach ing himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow took down his meerschaum and opened his plato 
 he did his best and did it manfully but i think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home 
 early as it was he was at the station next morning to see jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought well the gone and written no books earned no fortune but made a friend worth having and try to keep him all my life

lionfish nov chapter priori incantatemcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 wormtail approached harry who scrambled to find his feet to support his own weight before the ropes were untied wormtail raised his new silver hand pulled out the wad of material gagging harry and then with one swipe cut through the bonds tying harry to the gravestone 
 
 there was a split second perhaps when harry might have considered running for it but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave as the death eaters closed ranks forming a tighter circle around him and voldemort so that the gaps where the missing death eaters should have stood were filled wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where body lay and returned with wand which he thrust roughly into hand without looking at him then wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching death eaters 
 
 you have been taught how to duel harry potter said voldemort softly his red eyes glinting through the darkness 
 
 at these words harry remembered as though from a former life the dueling club at hogwarts he had attended briefly two years he had learned there was the disarming spell what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his wand even if he could when he was surrounded by death eaters outnumbered by at least thirty to one he had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this he knew he was facing the thing against which moody had always warnedthe unblockable avada kedavra curse and voldemort was right his mother was not here to die for him this was quite unprotected 
 
 we bow to each other harry said voldemort bending a little but keeping his snakelike face upturned to harry come the niceties must be would like you to show to death harry 
 
 the death eaters were laughing again lipless mouth was smiling harry did not bow he was not going to let voldemort play with him before killing himhe was not going to give him that satisfaction 
 
 i said bow voldemort said raising his wand and harry felt his spine curve as though a huge invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward and the death eaters laughed harder than ever 
 
 very good said voldemort softly and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon harry lifted too and now you face me like a and proud the way your father died 
 
 and now we duel 
 
 voldemort raised his wand and before harry could do anything to defend himself before he could even move he had been hit again by the cruciatus curse the pain was so intense so that he no longer knew where he knives were piercing every inch of his skin his head was surely going to burst with pain he was screaming more loudly than ever screamed in his life 
 
 and then it stopped harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet he was shaking as uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off he staggered sideways into the wall of watching death eaters and they pushed him away back toward voldemort 
 
 a little break said voldemort the nostrils dilating with excitement a little pausethat hurt it harry you want me to do that again do you 
 
 harry answer he was going to die like cedric those pitiless red eyes were telling him sohe was going to die and there was nothing he could do about itbut he going to play along he going to obey voldemorthe going to beg 
 
 i asked you whether you want me to do that again said voldemort softly answer me imperio 
 
 and harry felt for the third time in his life the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all it was bliss not to think it was as though he were floating dreamingjust answer nosay nojust answer no 
 
 i will not said a stronger voice in the back of his head i answer 
 
 just answer no 
 
 i do it i say it 
 
 just answer no 
 
 i 
 
 and these words burst from mouth they echoed through the graveyard and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him back rushed the aches that the cruciatus curse had left all over his body back rushed the realization of where he was and what he was facing 
 
 you said voldemort quietly and the death eaters were not laughing now you say no harry obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before you another little dose of pain 
 
 voldemort raised his wand but this time harry was ready with the reflexes born of his quidditch training he flung himself sideways onto the ground he rolled behind the marble headstone of father and he heard it crack as the curse missed him 
 
 we are not playing harry said soft cold voice drawing nearer as the death eaters laughed you cannot hide from me does this mean you are tired of our duel does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now harry come out harrycome out and play thenit will be quickit might even be painlessi would not knowi have never died 
 
 harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come there was no hopeno help to be had and as he heard voldemort draw nearer still he knew one thing only and it was beyond fear or reason he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing he was not going to die kneeling at feethe was going to die upright like his father and he was going to die trying to defend himself even if no defense was possible 
 
 before voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone harry stood uphe gripped his wand tightly in his hand thrust it out in front of him and threw himself around the headstone facing voldemort 
 
 voldemort was ready as harry shouted expelliarmus voldemort cried avada kedavra 
 
 a jet of green light issued from wand just as a jet of red light blasted from they met in midair and suddenly wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it his hand seized up around it he have released it if wanted to and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands neither red nor green but bright deep gold harry following the beam with his astonished gaze saw that long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating 
 
 and then nothing could have prepared harry for this he felt his feet lift from the ground he and voldemort were both being raised into the air their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light they glided away from the tombstone of father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of death eaters were shouting they were asking voldemort for instructions they were closing in reforming the circle around harry and voldemort the snake slithering at their heels some of them drawing their wands 
 
 the golden thread connecting harry and voldemort splintered though the wands remained connected a thousand more beams arced high over harry and voldemort crisscrossing all around them until they were enclosed in a golden web a cage of light beyond which the death eaters circled like jackals their cries strangely muffled now 
 
 do nothing voldemort shrieked to the death eaters and harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with harry held onto his wand more tightly with both hands and the golden thread remained unbroken do nothing unless i command you voldemort shouted to the death eaters 
 
 and then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the was coming from every thread of the web vibrating around harry and voldemort it was a sound harry recognized though he had heard it only once before in his life phoenix song 
 
 it was the sound of hope to harrythe most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around was the sound he connected with dumbledore and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear 
 
 break the connection 
 
 i know harry told the music i know i no sooner had he thought it than the thing became much harder to do his wand began to vibrate more powerfully than everand now the beam between him and voldemort changed tooit was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his direction of the beams movement was now toward him from voldemort and he felt his wand shudder angrily 
 
 as the closest bead of light moved nearer to wand tip the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame the closer that bead moved the harder wand vibrated he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers 
 
 he concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward voldemort his ears full of phoenix song his eyes furious fixedand slowly very slowly the beads quivered to a halt and then just as slowly they began to move the other wayand it was wand that was vibrating nowvoldemort who looked astonished and almost fearful 
 
 one of the beads of light was quivering inches from the tip of wand harry understand why he was doing it know what it might achievebut he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into wandand slowlyvery slowlyit moved along the golden threadit trembled for a momentand then it connected 
 
 at once wand began to emit echoing screams of painthen red eyes widened with shock a dense smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanishedthe ghost of the hand he had made wormtailmore shouts of painand then something much larger began to blossom from wand tip a great grayish something that looked as though it were made of the solidest densest was a headnow a chest and armsthe torso of cedric diggory 
 
 if ever harry might have released his wand from shock it would have been then but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken even though the thick gray ghost of cedric diggory was it a ghost it looked so solid emerged in its entirety from the end of wand as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunneland this shade of cedric stood up and looked up and down the golden thread of light and spoke 
 
 hold on harry it said 
 
 its voice was distant and echoing harry looked at voldemorthis wide red eyes were still shockedhe had no more expected this than harry hadand very dimly harry heard the frightened yells of the death eaters prowling around the edges of the golden dome 
 
 more screams of pain from the wandand then something else emerged from its tipthe dense shadow of a second head quickly followed by arms and torsoan old man harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as cedric had doneand his ghost or his shadow or whatever it was fell next to and surveyed harry and voldemort and the golden web and the connected wands with mild surprise leaning on his walking stick 
 
 he was a real wizard then the old man said his eyes on voldemort killed me that one fight him boy 
 
 but already yet another head was emergingand this head gray as a smoky statue was a both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others staring 
 
 the shadow of bertha jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes 
 
 let go now she cried and her voice echoed like as though from very far away let him get you harry let go 
 
 she and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web while the death eaters flitted around the outside of itand dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers whispered words of encouragement to harry and hissed words harry hear to voldemort 
 
 and now another head was emerging from the tip of wandand harry knew when he saw it who it would behe knew as though he had expected it from the moment when cedric had appeared from the wandknew because the man appearing was the one thought of more than any other tonight 
 
 the smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as bertha had done straightened up and looked at himand harry his arms shaking madly now looked back into the ghostly face of his father 
 
 your coming he said quietly she wants to see youit will be all righthold on 
 
 and she camefirst her head then her bodya young woman with long hair the smoky shadowy form of lily potter blossomed from the end of wand fell to the ground and straightened like her husband she walked close to harry looking down at him and she spoke in the same distant echoing voice as the others but quietly so that voldemort his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him could not hear 
 
 when the connection is broken we will linger for only momentsbut we will give you timeyou must get to the portkey it will return you to hogwartsdo you understand harry 
 
 yes harry gasped fighting now to keep a hold on his wand which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers 
 
 harry whispered the figure of cedric take my body back will you take my body back to my parents 
 
 i will said harry his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand 
 
 do it now whispered his voice be ready to rundo it now 
 
 now harry yelled he think he could have held on for another moment anyway he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench and the golden thread broke the cage of light vanished the phoenix song died but the shadowy figures of victims did not disappear they were closing in upon voldemort shielding harry from his gaze 
 
 and harry ran as he had never run in his life knocking two stunned death eaters aside as he passed he zigzagged behind headstones feeling their curses following him hearing them hit the headstones he was dodging curses and graves pelting toward body no longer aware of the pain in his leg his whole being concentrated on what he had to do 
 
 stun him he heard voldemort scream 
 
 ten feet from cedric harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it gripping his wand more tightly he dashed out from behind the angel 
 
 impedimenta he bellowed pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the death eaters running at him 
 
 from a muffled yell he thought he had stopped at least one of them but there was no time to stop and look he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him more jets of light flew over his head as he fell stretching out his hand to grab arm 
 
 stand aside i will kill him he is mine shrieked voldemort hand had closed on wrist one tombstone stood between him and voldemort but cedric was too heavy to carry and the cup was out of reach 
 
 red eyes flamed in the darkness harry saw his mouth curl into a smile saw him raise his wand 
 
 accio harry yelled pointing his wand at the triwizard cup it flew into the air and soared toward him harry caught it by the handle 
 
 he heard scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the portkey had worked it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color and cedric along with were going back

 harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the silken back it did not object but twisted its head around fangs bared and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes 
 
 he found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure then looked around at the others neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the back luna was already in place sitting and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day ron hermione and ginny however were still standing motionless on the spot and staring 
 
 what he said 
 
 we supposed to get on said ron faintly when we see the things 
 
 oh easy said luna sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him hermione and ginny come here 
 
 she pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount all three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed 
 
 this is mad ron murmured moving his free hand gingerly up and down his neck mad if i could just see it 
 
 better hope it stays invisible said harry darkly we all ready then 
 
 they all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes 
 
 ok 
 
 he looked down at the back of his glossy black head and swallowed 
 
 ministry of magic visitors entrance london then he said uncertainly er if you know where to go 
 
 for a moment thestral did nothing at all then with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him the wings on either side extended the horse crouched slowly then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump he closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a sunset 
 
 harry did not think he had ever moved so fast the thestral streaked over the castle its wide wings hardly beating the cooling air was slapping face eyes screwed up against the rushing wind he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream 
 
 they were over the hogwarts grounds they had passed hogsmeade harry could see mountains and gullies below them as the daylight began to fail harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills 
 
 this is bizarre harry barely heard ron yell from somewhere behind him and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support 
 
 twilight fell the sky was turning to a light dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars and soon only the lights of muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were travelling arms were wrapped tightly around his neck as he willed it to go even faster how much time had elapsed since he had seen sirius lying on the department of mysteries floor how much longer would sirius be able to resist voldemort all harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as voldemort wanted nor died for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel jubilation or fury course through his own body making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night mr weasley was attacked 
 
 on they flew through the gathering darkness face felt stiff and cold his legs numb from gripping the sides so tightly but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind he had lost all sense of how far they had come all his faith was in the beast beneath him still streaking purposefully through the night barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards 
 
 if they were too late 
 
 still alive still fighting i can feel it 
 
 if voldemort decided sirius was not going to crack 
 
 know 
 
 stomach gave a jolt the head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck they were descending at last he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction just as he had 
 
 and now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides they could see the tops of buildings streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes squares of pale yellow that were windows quite suddenly it seemed they were hurtling towards the pavement harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength braced for a sudden impact but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and harry slid from its back looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights 
 
 ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his thestral on to the pavement 
 
 never again he said struggling to his feet he made as though to stride away from his thestral but unable to see it collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again never ever again that was the worst 
 
 hermione and ginny touched down on either side of him both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than ron though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground neville jumped down shaking and luna dismounted smoothly 
 
 where do we go from here then she asked harry in a politely interested voice as though this was all a rather interesting 
 
 over here he said he gave his thestral a quick grateful pat then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door come on he urged the others as they hesitated 
 
 ron and ginny marched in obediently hermione neville and luna squashed themselves in after them harry took one glance back at the thestrals now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip then forced himself into the box after luna 
 
 nearest the receiver dial six two four four two he said 
 
 ron did it his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box 
 
 welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business 
 
 harry potter ron weasley hermione granger harry said very quickly ginny weasley neville longbottom luna lovegood here to save someone unless your ministry can do it first 
 
 thank you said the cool female voice visitors please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes 
 
 half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to harry over head he glanced at the topmost one harry mission 
 
 visitors to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium 
 
 fine harry said loudly as his scar gave another throb now can we move 
 
 the floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows the scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the ministry of magic 
 
 a chink of soft golden light hit their feet and widening rose up their bodies harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the atrium but it seemed to be completely empty the light was dimmer than it had been by day there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling 
 
 the ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant evening said the voice 
 
 the door of the telephone box burst open harry toppled out of it closely followed by neville and luna the only sound in the atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard the point of the arrow the tip of the hat and the ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool 
 
 come on said harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall harry in the lead past the fountain towards the desk where the watchwizard who had weighed wand had sat and which was now deserted 
 
 harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there sure their absence was an ominous sign and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts he pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately the golden grilles slid apart with a great echoing clanking and they dashed inside harry stabbed the number nine button the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend jangling and rattling harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with mr weasley he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building yet when the lilt halted the cool female voice said department of mysteries and the grilles slid open they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving out but the nearest torches flickering in the rush of air from the lift 
 
 harry turned towards the plain black door after months and months of dreaming about it he was here at last 
 
 go he whispered and he led the way down the corridor luna right behind him gazing around with her mouth slightly open 
 
 ok listen said harry stopping again within six feet of the door maybe maybe a couple of people should stay here as aas a lookout and 
 
 and we going to let you know coming asked ginny her eyebrows raised you could be miles away 
 
 coming with you harry said neville 
 
 get on with it said ron firmly 
 
 harry still did not want to take them all with him but it seemed he had no choice he turned to face the door and walked forwards just as it had in his dream it swung open and he marched over the threshold the others at his heels 
 
 they were standing in a large circular room everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling identical unmarked handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue their cool shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor made it look as though there was dark water underfoot 
 
 someone shut the door harry muttered 
 
 he regretted giving this order the moment neville had obeyed it without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor 
 
 in his dream harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on but there were around a dozen doors here just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him trying to decide which was the right one there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways the circular wall was rotating 
 
 hermione grabbed arm as though frightened the floor might move too but it did not for a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around then quite as suddenly as it had started the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again 
 
 eyes had blue streaks burned into them it was all he could see 
 
 what was that about whispered ron fearfully 
 
 i think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in through said ginny in a hushed voice 
 
 harry realised at once she was right he could no sooner identify the exit door than locate an ant on the floor and the door through which they needed to proceed could be any one of the dozen surrounding them 
 
 we going to get back out said neville uncomfortably 
 
 well that matter now said harry forcefully blinking to try to erase the blue lines from his vision and clutching his wand tighter than ever we need to get out till found sirius 
 
 go calling for him though hermione said urgently but harry had never needed her advice less his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible 
 
 where do we go then harry ron asked 
 
 i harry began he swallowed in the dreams i went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark this oneand then i went through another door into a room that kind of glitters we should try a few doors he said hastily know the right way when i see it 
 
 he marched straight at the door now facing him the others following close behind him set his left hand against its cool shining surface raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened and pushed 
 
 it swung open easily 
 
 after the darkness of the first room the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter though there were no glittering shimmering lights as harry had seen in his dreams the place was quite empty except for a few desks and in the very middle of the room an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid big enough for all of them to swim in a number of objects were drifting around lazily in it 
 
 those things whispered ron 
 
 dunno said harry 
 
 are they fish breathed ginny 
 
 aquavirius maggots said luna excitedly dad said the ministry were breeding 
 
 no said hermione she sounded odd she moved forward to look through the side of the tank brains 
 
 brains 
 
 yes i wonder what doing with them 
 
 harry joined her at the tank sure enough there could be no mistake now he saw them at close quarters glimmering eerily they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid looking something like slimy cauliflowers 
 
 get out of here said harry this right we need to try another door 
 
 there are doors here too said ron pointing around the walls heart sank how big was this place 
 
 in my dream i went through that dark room into the second one he said i think we should go back and try from there 
 
 so they hurried back into the dark circular room the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before eyes instead of the blue candle flames 
 
 wait said hermione sharply as luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them flagrate 
 
 she drew with her wand in midair and a fiery x appeared on the door no sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling and once again the wall began to revolve very fast but now there was a great blur in amongst the faint blue and when all became still again the fiery cross still burned showing the door they had already tried 
 
 good thinking said harry ok try this one 
 
 again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open his wand still raised the others at his heels 
 
 this room was larger than the last dimly lit and rectangular and the centre of it was sunken forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep they were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre or the courtroom in which harry had been tried by the wizengamot instead of a chained chair however there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient cracked and crumbling that harry was amazed the thing was still standing unsupported by any surrounding wall the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched 
 
 there said harry jumping down on to the bench below there was no answering voice but the veil continued to flutter and sway 
 
 careful whispered hermione 
 
 harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly towards the dais the pointed archway looked much taller from where he now stood than it had when been looking down on it from above still the veil swayed gently as though somebody had just passed through it 
 
 sirius harry spoke again but more quietly now that he was nearer 
 
 he had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway gripping his wand very tightly he edged around the dais but there was nobody there all that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil 
 
 go called hermione from halfway up the stone steps this right harry come on go 
 
 she sounded scared much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam yet harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it old though it was the gently rippling veil intrigued him he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it 
 
 harry go ok said hermione more forcefully 
 
 ok he said but did not move he had just heard something there were faint whispering murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil 
 
 what are you saying he said very loudly so that his words echoed all around the stone benches 
 
 talking harry said hermione now moving over to him 
 
 whispering behind there he said moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil is that you ron 
 
 here mate said ron appearing around the side of the archway 
 
 anyone else hear it harry demanded for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder without really meaning to put it there he found his foot was on the dais 
 
 i can hear them too breathed luna joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil there are people in there 
 
 what do you mean in there demanded hermione jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted there any in there just an archway no room for anybody to be there harry stop it come away 
 
 she grabbed his arm and pulled but he resisted 
 
 harry we are supposed to be here for sirius she said in a strained voice 
 
 sirius harry repeated still gazing mesmerised at the continuously swaying veil yeah 
 
 something finally slid back into place in his brain sirius captured bound and tortured and he was staring at this archway 
 
 he took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil 
 
 go he said 
 
 what been trying towell come on then said hermione and she led the way back around the dais on the other side ginny and neville were staring apparently entranced at the veil too without speaking hermione took hold of arm 
 
 ron grabbed and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door 
 
 what reckon that arch was harry asked hermione as they regained the dark circular room 
 
 i know but whatever it was it was dangerous she said firmly again inscribing a fiery cross on the door 
 
 once more the wall span and became still again harry approached another door at random and pushed it did not move 
 
 wrong said hermione 
 
 locked said harry throwing his weight at the door but it budge 
 
 this is it then it said ron excitedly joining harry in the attempt to force the door open bound to be 
 
 get out of the way said hermione sharply she pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said alohomora 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 knife said harry he pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall the others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door it remained as firmly shut as ever what was more when harry looked down at the knife he saw the blade had melted 
 
 right leaving that room said hermione decisively 
 
 but what if the one said ron staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing 
 
 it be harry could get through all the doors in his dream said hermione marking the door with another fiery cross as harry replaced the handle of knife in his pocket 
 
 you know what could be in there said luna eagerly as the wall started to spin yet again 
 
 something blibbering no doubt said hermione under her breath and neville gave a nervous little laugh 
 
 the wall slid to a halt and harry with a feeling of increasing desperation pushed the next door open 
 
 this is it 
 
 he knew it at once by the beautiful dancing light as eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clocks gleaming from every surface large and small grandfather and carriage hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room so that a busy relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule marching footsteps the source of the dancing light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room 
 
 this way 
 
 heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks heading as he had done in his dream for the source of the light the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing glittering wind 
 
 oh took said ginny as they drew nearer pointing at the very heart of the bell jar 
 
 drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny egg as it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged which was carried to the very top of the jar but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg 
 
 keep going said harry sharply because ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the progress back into a bird 
 
 you dawdled enough by that old arch she said crossly but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it 
 
 this is it harry said again and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech through here 
 
 he glanced around at them all they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious he looked back at the door and pushed it swung open 
 
 they were there they had found the place high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small dusty glass orbs they glimmered dully in the light issuing from more set at intervals along the shelves like those in the circular room behind them their flames were burning blue the room was very cold 
 
 harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves he could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement 
 
 you said it was row whispered hermione 
 
 yeah breathed harry looking up at the end of the closest row beneath the branch of candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 
 
 we need to go right i think whispered hermione squinting to the next row yes 
 
 keep your wands ready harry said softly 
 
 they crept forward glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves the further ends of which were in darkness tiny yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelves some of them had a weird liquid glow others were as dull and dark within as blown light bulbs 
 
 they passed row harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement but sirius might be gagged now or else unconscious or said an unbidden voice inside his head he might already be dead 
 
 have felt it he told himself his heart now hammering against his apple already know 
 
 whispered hermione 
 
 they stood grouped around the end of the row gazing down the alley beside it there was nobody there 
 
 right down at the end said harry whose mouth had become slightly dry you see properly from here 
 
 and he led them between the towering rows of glass balls some of which glowed softly as they passed 
 
 he should be near here whispered harry convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of sirius into view on the darkened floor anywhere here really close 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively but he did not want to respond his mouth was very dry 
 
 somewhere about here he said 
 
 they had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight there was nobody there all was echoing dusty silence 
 
 he might be harry whispered hoarsely peering down the next alley or maybe he hurried to look down the one beyond that 
 
 harry said hermione again 
 
 what he snarled 
 
 i i think sirius is here 
 
 nobody spoke harry did not want to look at any of them he felt sick he did not understand why sirius was not here he had to be here this was where he harry had seen him 
 
 he ran up the space at the end of the rows staring down them empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past he ran the other way back past his staring companions there was no sign of sirius anywhere nor any hint of a struggle 
 
 harry ron called 
 
 what 
 
 he did not want to hear what ron had to say did not want to hear ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to hogwarts but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the atrium above and the others accusing stares 
 
 have you seen this said ron 
 
 what said harry but eagerly this timeit had to be a sign that sirius had been there a clue he strode back to where they were all standing a little way down row but found nothing except ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf 
 
 what harry repeated glumly 
 
 got your name on said ron 
 
 harry moved a little closer ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years 
 
 my name said harry blankly 
 
 he stepped forwards not as tall as ron he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball in spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously and below that 
 
 to 
 
 dark lord 
 
 and harry potter 
 
 harry stared at it 
 
 what is it ron asked sounding unnerved your name doing down here 
 
 he glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf 
 
 not here he said sounding perplexed none of the rest of us are here 
 
 harry i think you should touch it said hermione sharply as he stretched out his hand 
 
 why not he said something to do with me it 
 
 harry said neville suddenly harry looked at him round face was shining slightly with sweat he looked as though he could not take much more suspense 
 
 got my name on said harry 
 
 and feeling slightly reckless he closed his fingers around the dusty surface he had expected it to feel cold but it did not on the contrary it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours as though the glow of light within was warming it expecting even hoping that something dramatic was going to happen something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worth while after all harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it 
 
 nothing whatsoever happened the others moved in closer around harry gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust 
 
 and then from right behind them a drawling voice spoke 
 
 very good potter now turn around nice and slowly and give that to me 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the forest againcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 finally the truth lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive his job was to walk calmly into deaths welcoming arms along the way he was to dispose of voldemorts remaining links to life so that when at last he flung himself across voldemorts path and did not raise a wand to defend himself the end would be clean and the job that ought to have been done in godrics hollow would be finished neither would live neither could survive 
 
 he felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest how strange that in his dread of death it pumped all the harder valiantly keeping him alive but it would have to stop and soon its beats were numbered how many would there be time for as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time out into the grounds and into the forest 
 
 terror washed over him as he lay on the floor with that funeral drum pounding inside him would it hurt to die all those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped he had never really thought of the thing itself his will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape to outrun voldemort it was over he knew it and all that was left was the thing itself dying 
 
 if he could only have died on that summers night when he had left number four privet drive for the last time when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him if he could only have died like hedwig so quickly he would not have known it had happened or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved he envied even his parents deaths now this walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery he felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them although no one could see him the portraits on the walls were all empty 
 
 slowly very slowly he sat up and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was brain and nerve and bounding heart it would all be gone or at least he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep and his mouth and throat were completely dry but so were his eyes 
 
 dumbledores betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan harry had simply been too foolish to see it he realized that now he had never questioned his own assumption that dumbledore wanted him alive now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the horcruxes dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only voldemort but himself to life how neat how elegant not to waste any more lives but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter and whose death would not be a calamity but another blow against voldemort 
 
 and dumbledore had known that harry would not duck out that he would keep going to the end even though it was his end because he had taken trouble to get to know him hadnt he dumbledore knew as voldemort knew that harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it the images of fred lupin and tonks lying dead in the great hall forced their way back into his minds eye and for a moment he could hardly breathe death was impatient 
 
 but dumbledore had overestimated him he had failed the snake survived one horcrux remained to bind voldemort to the earth even after harry had been killed true that would mean an easier job for somebody he wondered who would do it ron and hermione would know what needed to be done of course that would have been why dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early they could carry on 
 
 like rain on a cold window these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth which was that he must die i must die it must end 
 
 ron and hermione seemed a long way away in a country he felt as though he had parted from them long ago there would be no and no explanations he was determined of that this was a journey they could not take together and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time he looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday nearly half of the hour allotted by voldemort for his surrender had elapsed 
 
 he stood up his heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird perhaps it knew it had little time left perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetimes beats before the end he did not look back as he closed the office door 
 
 the castle was empty he felt ghostly striding through it alone as if he had already died the portrait people were still missing from their frames the whole place was eerily still as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the great hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed 
 
 harry pulled the invisibility cloak over himself and descended through the floors at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed to be seen to be stopped but the cloak was as ever impenetrable perfect and he reached the front doors easily 
 
 then neville nearly walked into him he was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach colon creevey though underage must have sneaked back just as malfoy crabbe and goyle had done he was tiny in death 
 
 you know what i can manage him alone neville said oliver wood and he heaved colin over his shoulder in a firemans lift and carried him into the great hall 
 
 neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand he looked like an old man then he set off on the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies 
 
 harry took one glance back at the entrance of the great hall people were moving around trying to comfort each other drinking kneeling beside the dead but he could not see any of the people he loved no hint of hermione ron ginny or any of the other weasleys no luna he felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them but then would he ever have the strength to stop looking it was better like this 
 
 he moved down the steps and out into the darkness it was nearly four in the morning and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath waiting to see whether he could do what he must 
 
 harry moved toward neville who was bending over another body 
 
 neville 
 
 blimey harry you nearly gave me heart failure 
 
 harry had pulled off the cloak the idea had come to him out of nowhere born out of a desire to make absolutely sure 
 
 where are you going alone neville asked suspiciously 
 
 its all part of the plan said harry theres something ive got to do listen cneville c 
 
 harry neville looked suddenly scared harry youre not thinking of handing yourself over 
 
 no harry lied easily course not this is something else but i might be out of sight for a while you know voldemorts snake neville hes got a huge snake calls it nagini 
 
 ive heard yeah what about it 
 
 its got to be killed ron and hermione know that but just in case they c 
 
 the awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment made it impossible to keep talking but he pulled himself together again this was crucial he must be like dumbledore keep a cool head make sure there were backups others to carry on dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the horcruxes now neville would take harrys place there would still be three in the secret 
 
 just in case theyre c busy c and you get the chance c 
 
 kill the snake 
 
 kill the snake harry repeated 
 
 all right harry youre okay are you 
 
 im fine thanks neville 
 
 but neville seized his wrist as harry made to move on 
 
 were all going to keep fighting harry you know that 
 
 yeah i c 
 
 the suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence he could not go on neville did not seem to find it strange he patted harry on the shoulder released him and walked away to look for more bodies 
 
 harry swung the cloak back over himself and walked on someone else was moving not far away stooping over another prone figure on the ground he was feet away from her when he realized it was ginny 
 
 he stopped in his tracks she was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother 
 
 its all right ginny was saying its ok were going to get you inside 
 
 but i want to go home whispered the girl i dont want to fight anymore 
 
 i know said ginny and her voice broke its going to be all right 
 
 ripples of cold undulated over harrys skin he wanted to shout out to the night he wanted ginny to know that he was there he wanted her to know where he was going he wanted to be stopped to be dragged back to be sent back home 
 
 but he was home hogwards was the first and best home he had known he and voldemort and snape the abandoned boys had all found home here 
 
 ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now holding her hand with a huge effort harry forced himself on he thought he saw ginny look around as he passed and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby but he did not speak and he did not look back 
 
 hagrids hut loomed out of the darkness there were no lights no sound of fang scrabbling at the door his bark booming in welcome all those visits to hagrid and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire and rock cakes and giant grubs and his great bearded face and ron vomiting slugs and hermione helping him save norbert 
 
 he moved on and now he reached the edge of the forest and he stopped 
 
 a swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees he could feel their chill and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it he had not strength left for a patronus he could no longer control his own trembling it was not after all so easy to die every second he breathed the smell of the grass the cool air on his face was so precious to think that people had years and years time to waste so much time it dragged and he was clinging to each second at the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on and knew that he must the long game was ended the snitch had been caught it was time to leave the air 
 
 the snitch his nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 breathing fast and hard he stared down at it now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible he seemed to have sped up and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed though this was the close this was the moment 
 
 he pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered i am about to die 
 
 the metal shell broke open he lowered his shaking hand raised dracos wand beneath the cloak and murmured lumos 
 
 the black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the snitch the resurrection stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the elder wand the triangle and circle representing the cloak and the stone were still discernible 
 
 and again harry understood without having to think it did not matter about bringing them back for he was about to join them he was not really fetching them they were fetching him 
 
 he closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times 
 
 he knew it had happened because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy ground that marked the outer edge of the forest he opened his eyes and looked around 
 
 they were neither ghost nor truly flesh he could see that they resembled most closely the riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago and he had been memory made nearly solid less substantial than living bodies but much more than ghosts they moved toward him and on each face there was the same loving smile 
 
 james was exactly the same height as harry he was wearing the clothes in which he had died and his hair was untidy and ruffled and his glasses were a little lopsided like mr weasleys 
 
 sirius was tall and handsome and younger by far than harry had seen him in life he loped with an easy grace his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face 
 
 lupin was younger too and much less shabby and his hair was thicker and darker he looked happy to be back in this familiar place scene of so many adolescent wanderings 
 
 lilys smile was widest of all she pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him and her green eyes so like his searched his face hungrily as though she would never be able to look at him enough 
 
 youve been so brave 
 
 he could not speak his eyes feasted on her and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever and that would be enough 
 
 you are nearly there said james very close we are so proud of you 
 
 does it hurt 
 
 the childish question had fallen from harrys lips before he could stop it 
 
 dying not at all said sirius quicker and easier than falling asleep 
 
 and he will want it to be quick he wants it over said lupin 
 
 i didnt want you to die harry said these words came without his volition any of you im sorry c 
 
 he addressed lupin more than any of them beseeching him 
 
 c right after youd had your son remus im sorry c 
 
 i am sorry too said lupin sorry i will never know him but he will know why i died and i hope he will understand i was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life 
 
 a chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at harrys brow he knew that they would not tell him to go that it would have to be his decision 
 
 youll stay with me 
 
 until the very end said james 
 
 they wont be able to see you asked harry 
 
 we are part of you said sirius invisible to anyone else 
 
 harry looked at his mother 
 
 stay close to me he said quietly 
 
 and he set of the dementors chill did not overcome him he passed through it with his companions and they acted like patronuses to him and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together their branches tangled their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot harry clutched the cloak tightly around him in the darkness traveling deeper and deeper into the forest with no idea where exactly voldemort was but sure that he would find him beside him making scarcely a sound walked james sirius lupin and lily and their presence was his courage and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other 
 
 his body and mind felt oddly disconnected now his limbs working without conscious instruction as if he were passenger not driver in the body he was about to leave the dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle ron hermione ginny and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life toward voldemort 
 
 a thud and a whisper some other living creature had stirred close by harry stopped under the cloak peering around listening and his mother and father lupin and sirius stopped too 
 
 someone there came a rough whisper close at hand hes got an invisibility cloak could it be c 
 
 two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree their wands flared and harry saw yaxley and dolohov peering into the darkness directly at the place harry his mother and father and sirius and lupin stood apparently they could not see anything 
 
 definitely heard something said yaxley animal dyou reckon 
 
 that head case hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here said dolohov glancing over his shoulder 
 
 yaxley looked down at his watch 
 
 times nearly up porters had his hour hes not coming 
 
 better go back said yaxley find out what the plan is now 
 
 he and dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest harry followed them knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go he glanced sideways and his mother smiled at him and his father nodded encouragement 
 
 they had traveled on mere minutes when harry saw light ahead and yaxley and dolohov stepped out into a clearing that harry knew had been the place where the monstrous aragog had once lived the remnants of his vast web were there still but the swarms of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the death eaters to fight for their cause 
 
 a fire burned in the middle of the clearing and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent watchful death eaters some of them were still masked and hooded others showed their faces two giants sat on the outskirts of the group casting massive shadows over the scene their faces cruel like rock harry saw fenrir skulking chewing his long nails the great blond rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip he saw lucius malfoy who looked defeated and terrified and narcissa whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension 
 
 every eye was fixed upon voldemort who stood with his head bowed and his white hands folded over the elder wand in front of him he might have been praying or else counting silently in his mind and harry standing still on the edge of the scene though absurdly of a child counting in a game of behind his head still swirling and coiling the great snake nagini floated in her glittering charmed cage like a monstrous halo 
 
 when dolohov and yaxley rejoined the circle voldemort looked up 
 
 no sign of him my lord said dolohov 
 
 voldemorts expression did not change the red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight slowly he drew the elder wand between his long fingers 
 
 my lord c 
 
 bellatrix had spoken she sat closest to voldemort disheveled her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed 
 
 voldemort raised his hand to silence her and she did not speak another word but eyed him in worshipful fascination 
 
 i thought he would come said voldemort in his high clear voice his eyes on the leaping flames i expected him to come 
 
 nobody spoke they seemed as scared as harry whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside his hands were sweating as he pulled off the invisibility cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes with his wand he did not want to be tempted to fight 
 
 i was it seems mistaken said voldemort 
 
 you werent 
 
 harry said it as loudly as he could with all the force he could muster he did not want to sound afraid the resurrection stone slipped from between his numb fingers and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents sirius and lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight at that moment he felt that nobody mattered but voldemort it was just the two of them 
 
 the illusion was gone as soon as it had come the giants roared as the death eaters rose together and there were many cries gasps even laughter voldemort had frozen where he stood but his red eyes had found harry and he stared as harry moved toward him with nothing but the fire between them 
 
 then a voice yelled harry no 
 
 he turned hagrid was bound and trussed tied to a tree nearby his massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled desperate 
 
 no no harry whatre yeh c 
 
 quiet shouted rowle and with a flick of his wand hagrid was silenced 
 
 bellatrix who had leapt to her feet was looking eagerly from voldemort to harry her breast heaving the only things that moved were the flames and the snake coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind voldemorts head 
 
 harry could feel his wand against his chest but he made no attempt to draw it he knew that the snake was too well protected knew that if he managed to point the wand at nagini fifty curses would hit him first and still voldemort and harry looked at each other and now voldemort tilted his head a little to the side considering the boy standing before him and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth 
 
 harry potter he said very softly his voice might have been part of the spitting fire the boy who lived 
 
 none of the death eaters moved they were waiting everything was waiting hagrid was struggling and bellatrix was panting and harry thought inexplicably of ginny and her blazing look and the feel of her lips on his c voldemort had raised his wand his head was still tilted to one side like a curious child wondering what would happen if he proceeded harry looked back into the red eyes and wanted it to happen now quickly while he could still stand before he lost control before he betrayed fear c 
 
 he saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everything was gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it sounds up from the in the 
 every child in the old town of odense on the island of 
 funen knows the au which washes the gardens round about the town and flows on under the wooden bridges from the dam to the 
 in the au grow the yellow and brown 
 feathery reeds the dark velvety flag grows there high and thick old 
 and decayed willows slanting and tottering hang far out over the 
 stream beside the meadow and by the bleaching ground but 
 opposite there are gardens upon gardens each different from the rest 
 some with pretty flowers and bowers like little dolls pleasure 
 grounds often displaying cabbage and other kitchen plants and here 
 and there the gardens cannot be seen at all for the great elder trees 
 that spread themselves out by the bank and hang far out over the 
 streaming waters which are deeper here and there than an oar can 
 fathom opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place which is called 
 the and there dwells the old water spirit the 
 this spirit sleeps through the day while the sun shines down upon 
 the water but in starry and moonlit nights he shows himself he is 
 very old grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him he is said to lead a solitary life and to have nobody with 
 whom he can converse save the great old church bell once the bell 
 hung in the church tower but now there is no trace left of the 
 tower or of the church which was called st 
 
 sounded the bell when the tower still 
 stood there and one evening while the sun was setting and the 
 bell was swinging away bravely it broke loose and came flying down 
 through the air the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam 
 
 now retire to rest sang the bell 
 and flew down into the where it is deepest and that is why the place is called the 
 
 but the bell got neither rest nor sleep down in the 
 haunt it sounds and rings so that the tones sometimes pierce upward 
 through the waters and many people maintain that its strains forebode 
 the death of some one but that is not true for the bell is only 
 talking with the who is now no longer alone 
 
 and what is the bell telling it is old very old as we have 
 already observed it was there long before grandmother was born and yet it is but a child in comparison with the who is quite an old quiet personage an oddity with his hose of and his scaly jacket with the yellow lilies for buttons and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his beard but he looks very pretty for all that 
 
 what the bell tells to repeat it all would require years and 
 days for year by year it is telling the old stories sometimes 
 short ones sometimes long ones according to its whim it tells of 
 old times of the dark hard times thus 
 
 in the church of st alban the monk had mounted up into the 
 tower he was young and handsome but thoughtful exceedingly he 
 looked through the loophole out upon the when the bed of the water was yet broad and the monks meadow was still a lake he looked out over it and over the rampart and over the nuns hill 
 opposite where the convent lay and the light gleamed forth from 
 the cell he had known the nun right well and he thought of 
 her and his heart beat quicker as he thought 
 yes this was the story the bell told 
 
 into the tower came also the dapper of the bishop 
 and when i the bell who am made of metal rang hard and loud and 
 swung to and fro i might have beaten out his brains he sat down 
 close under me and played with two little sticks as if they had 
 been a stringed instrument and he sang to it now i may sing it 
 out aloud though at other times i may not whisper it i may sing of 
 everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars yonder it is 
 cold and wet the rats are eating her up alive nobody knows of it 
 nobody hears of it not even now for the bell is ringing and 
 singing its loud 
 
 there was a king in those days they called him canute he 
 bowed himself before bishop and monk but when he offended the free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words they seized their weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast he sought shelter in the church and shut gate and door behind him the violent band surrounded the church i heard tell of it the crows ravens and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded 
 around they flew into the tower and out again they looked down 
 upon the throng below and they also looked into the windows of the 
 church and screamed out aloud what they saw there king canute 
 knelt before the altar in prayer his brothers eric and benedict stood 
 by him as a guard with drawn swords but the servant the 
 treacherous blake betrayed his master the throng in front of the 
 church knew where they could hit the king and one of them flung a 
 stone through a pane of glass and the king lay there dead the 
 cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded through the air and i joined in it also for i sang the church bell hangs high and looks far around and sees the birds around it and understands their language the wind roars in 
 upon it through windows and loopholes and the wind knows 
 everything for he gets it from the air which encircles all things 
 and the church bell understands his tongue and rings it out into 
 the world 
 
 but it was too much for me to hear and to know i was not able 
 any longer to ring it out i became so tired so heavy that the 
 beam broke and i flew out into the gleaming au where the water is 
 deepest and where the lives solitary and alone and year 
 by year i tell him what i have heard and what i know 
 
 
 thus it sounds complainingly out of the in the 
 that is what grandmother told us 
 
 but the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung 
 down there for that it could not do so and that no dwelt 
 yonder for there was no at all and when all the other church bells are sounding sweetly he says that it is not really the bells 
 that are sounding but that it is the air itself which sends forth the 
 notes and grandmother said to us that the bell itself said it was the 
 air who told it to him consequently they are agreed on that point 
 and this much is sure 
 
 be cautious cautious and take good heed to thyself they 
 both say 
 
 the air knows everything it is around us it is in us it talks 
 of our thoughts and of our deeds and it speaks longer of them than 
 does the bell down in the depths of the where the dwells it rings it out in the vault of heaven far far out 
 forever and ever till the heaven bells sound

 book and grandfather 
 chapter vi 
 
 the two old men do everything each one after his own fashion to render cosette happy 
 everything was made ready for the wedding 
 the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february it was then december 
 a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed 
 the grandfather was not the least happy of them all 
 he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette 
 the wonderful beautiful girl he exclaimed 
 and she has so sweet and good an air she is without exception the most charming girl that i have ever seen in my life 
 later on have virtues with an odor of violets 
 how graceful one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such a creature 
 marius my boy you are a baron you are rich go to pettifogging i beg of you 
 cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it 
 do you understand anything about it said marius to cosette 
 no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us 
 jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy 
 he hastened towards happiness with as much ardor and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself 
 as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted civil status 
 if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might prevent the marriage who knows 
 he extricated cosette from all difficulties 
 he concocted for her a family of dead people a sure means of not encountering any objections cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fauchelevent two brothers fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent of the inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity and not attaching any importance to the matter had never understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal 
 an acte de notoriete was drawn up 
 cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle euphrasie fauchelevent 
 she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead 
 jean valjean so arranged it that he was appointed under the name of fauchelevent as guardian with m gillenormand as supervising guardian over him 
 as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown 
 the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and thousand francs but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euphrasie five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party was to be turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million 
 there were some peculiarities here and there it is true but they were not noticed one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love the others by the six hundred thousand francs 
 cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father 
 he was merely a kinsman another fauchelevent was her real father 
 at any other time this would have broken her heart 
 but at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through it cast but a slight shadow a faint cloud and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long she had marius 
 the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life 
 and then cosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain renunciations 
 nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean 
 father 
 cosette happy as the angels was enthusiastic over father gillenormand it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents 
 while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status m gillenormand was superintending the basket of wedding gifts 
 nothing so amused him as being magnificent 
 he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother 
 these fashions come up again said he ancient things are the rage and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood 
 he rifled his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer with swelling fronts which had not been opened for us hear the confession of these dowagers he said let us see what they have in their paunches 
 he noisily violated the drawers of all his wives of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers pekins damasks lampas painted moires robes of shot gros de tours india kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed dauphines without a right or wrong side in the piece genoa and alencon point lace parures in antique work ivory boxes ornamented with microscopic battles gewgaws and ribbons he lavished everything on cosette 
 cosette amazed desperately in love with marius and wild with gratitude towards m gillenormand dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin and velvet her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim her soul flew out into the azure depths with wings of mechlin lace 
 the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather 
 a sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the rue des 
 every morning a fresh offering of from the grandfather to cosette 
 all possible knickknacks glittered around her 
 one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said apropos of i know not what incident 
 the men of the revolution are so great that they have the prestige of the ages like cato and like phocion and each one of them seems to me an antique memory 
 moire antique exclaimed the old gentleman 
 thanks marius that is precisely the idea of which i was in search 
 and on the following day a magnificent dress of colored moire antique was added to wedding presents 
 from these fripperies the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom 
 love is all very well but there must be something else to go with it 
 the useless must be mingled with happiness 
 happiness is only the necessary 
 season that enormously with the superfluous for me 
 a palace and her heart 
 her heart and the louvre her heart and the grand waterworks of versailles 
 give me my shepherdess and try to make her a duchess 
 fetch me phyllis crowned with and add a hundred thousand francs income open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see beneath a marble colonnade 
 i consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold 
 dry happiness resembles dry bread one eats but one does not dine 
 i want the superfluous the useless the extravagant excess that which serves no purpose i remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasburg a clock as tall as a house which marked the hours which had the kindness to indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and which after having struck midday or midnight midday the hour of the sun or midnight the hour of love or any other hour that you like gave you the moon and the stars the earth and the sea birds and fishes phoebus and phoebe and a host of things which emerged from a niche and the twelve apostles and the emperor charles the fifth and eponine and sabinus and a throng of little gilded goodmen who played on the trumpet to boot 
 without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air on every occasion without any knowing why is a petty bald which merely tells the hour equal to that for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest 
 m gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding and all the fripperies of the eighteenth century passed through his dithyrambs 
 you are ignorant of the art of festivals 
 you do not know how to organize a day of enjoyment in this age he exclaimed your nineteenth century is weak 
 it lacks excess 
 it ignores the rich it ignores the noble 
 in everything it is your third estate is insipid colorless odorless and shapeless the dreams of your bourgeois who set up as they express it a pretty boudoir freshly decorated violet ebony and calico make way 
 make way the sieur curmudgeon is marrying mademoiselle sumptuousness and splendor 
 a louis has been stuck to a candle 
 the epoch for you 
 my demand is that i may flee from it beyond the sarmatians 
 ah in i predict that all was lost from the day when i beheld the duc de rohan prince de leon duc de chabot duc de montbazon marquis de sonbise vicomte de thouars peer of france go to longchamps in a tapecu that has borne its fruits 
 in this century men attend to business they gamble on change they win money they are stingy 
 people take care of their surfaces and varnish them every one is dressed as though just out of a washed soaped scraped shaved combed waked smoothed rubbed brushed cleaned on the outside irreproachable polished as a pebble discreet neat and at the same time death of my life in the depths of their consciences they have and cesspools that are enough to make a who blows his nose in his fingers recoil 
 i grant to this age the device dirty cleanliness 
 be vexed marius give me permission to speak i say no evil of the people as you see i am always harping on your people but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie 
 i belong to it 
 he who loves well lashes well 
 thereupon i say plainly that people marry but that they no longer know how to marry 
 ah it is true i regret the grace of the ancient manners 
 i regret everything about them their elegance their chivalry those courteous and delicate ways that joyous luxury which every one possessed music forming part of the wedding a symphony above stairs a beating of drums below stairs the dances the joyous faces round the table the gallant compliments the songs the fireworks the frank laughter the own row the huge knots of ribbon 
 i regret the garter 
 the garter is cousin to the girdle of venus on what does the war of troy turn 
 on garter parbleu why did they fight why did diomed the divine break over the head of meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points why did achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances because helen allowed paris to take her garter 
 with garter homer would construct the iliad 
 he would put in his poem a loquacious old fellow like me and he would call him nestor my friends in bygone days in those amiable days of yore people married wisely they had a good contract and then they had a good carouse 
 as soon as cujas had taken his departure gamacho entered 
 but in sooth the stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due and which wants to have its wedding also people supped well and had at table a beautiful neighbor without a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed oh the large laughing mouths and how gay we were in those days youth was a bouquet every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft of roses whether he was a shepherd or a warrior and if by chance one was a captain of dragoons one found means to call oneself florian 
 people thought much of looking well they embroidered and tinted themselves 
 a bourgeois had the air of a flower a marquis had the air of a precious stone 
 people had no straps to their boots they had no boots 
 they were spruce shining waved lustrous fluttering dainty coquettish which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their sides 
 the has beak and claws 
 that was the day of the galland indies 
 one of the sides of that century was delicate the other was magnificent and by the green cabbages people amused themselves 
 people are serious 
 the bourgeois is avaricious the bourgeoise is a prude your century is unfortunate 
 people would drive away the graces as being too low in the neck 
 alas beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness 
 since the revolution everything including the has had its trousers a mountebank dancer must be grave your rigadoons are doctrinarian 
 it is necessary to be majestic people would be greatly annoyed if they did not carry their chins in their cravats 
 the ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries is to resemble m and do you know what one arrives at with that majesty at being petty 
 learn this joy is not only joyous it is great 
 but be in love gayly then what the deuce marry when you marry with fever and giddiness and tumult and the uproar of happiness 
 be grave in church well and good 
 but as soon as the mass is finished sarpejou you must make a dream whirl around the bride 
 a marriage should be royal and chimerical it should promenade its ceremony from the cathedral of rheims to the pagoda of chanteloup 
 i have a horror of a paltry wedding 
 ventregoulette be in olympus for that one day at least 
 be one of the gods 
 ah people might be sylphs games and laughter argiraspides they are stupids 
 my friends every recently made bridegroom ought to be prince aldobrandini profit by that unique minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the frogs 
 economize on the nuptials do not prune them of their splendors scrimp on the day when you beam 
 the wedding is not the housekeeping oh if i were to carry out my fancy it would be gallant violins would be heard under the trees 
 here is my programme 
 and silver i would mingle with the festival the rural divinities i would convoke the dryads and the nereids 
 the nuptials of amphitrite a rosy cloud nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked an academician offering quatrains to the goddess a chariot drawn by marine monsters triton trottait devant et tirait de sa conque des sons si ravissants ravissait quiconque 
 a festive programme a good one or else i know nothing of such matters deuce take it 
 triton trotted on before and drew from his sounds so ravishing that he delighted everyone 
 while the grandfather in full lyrical effusion was listening to himself cosette and marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at each other 
 aunt gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount of emotions 
 marius returned marius brought back bleeding marius brought back from a barricade marius dead then living marius reconciled marius betrothed marius wedding a poor girl marius wedding a millionairess 
 the six hundred thousand francs had been her last surprise 
 then her indifference of a girl taking her first communion returned to her 
 she went regularly to service told her beads read her euchology mumbled aves in one corner of the house while i love you was being whispered in the other and she beheld marius and cosette in a vague way like two shadows the shadow was herself 
 there is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul neutralized by torpor a stranger to that which may be designated as the business of living receives no impressions either human or pleasant or painful with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes this devotion as father gillenormand said to his daughter corresponds to a cold in the head 
 you smell nothing of life neither any bad nor any good odor 
 moreover the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly indecision 
 her father had acquired the habit of taking her so little into account that he had not consulted her in the matter of consent to marius marriage 
 he had acted impetuously according to his wont having a slave but a single satisfy marius 
 as for the had not even occurred to him that the aunt existed and that she could have an opinion of her own and sheep as she was this had vexed her somewhat resentful in her inmost soul but impassible externally she had said to herself 
 my father has settled the question of the marriage without reference to me i shall settle the question of the inheritance without consulting him 
 she was rich in fact and her father was not 
 she had reserved her decision on this point it is probable that had the match been a poor one she would have left him poor 
 so much the worse for my nephew he is wedding a beggar let him be a beggar himself 
 but pleased the aunt and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers were concerned 
 one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people since they did not need it 
 it was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather m gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber the finest in the house 
 that will make me young again he said an old plan of mine 
 i have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my chamber 
 he furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles he had the ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff which he had by him in the piece and which he believed to have emanated from utrecht with a satin ground covered with velvet auricula was with that stuff said he that the bed of the duchesse at la was draped on the he set a little figure in saxe porcelain carrying a muff against her nude stomach 
 m library became the study which marius needed a study it will be remembered being required by the council of the order

 first epilogue 
 chapter xiii 
 
 when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience and so though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an absence high time my dear high time we were all weary of waiting for you well thank god and received her presents with another customary remark not the gift precious my dear but that you give it to me an old woman yet it was evident that she was not pleased by arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game 
 she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents they consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid and a gold snuffbox with the portrait on the lid which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had long wished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards 
 thank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she always did but best of all you have brought yourself back for i never saw anything like it you ought to give your wife a scolding what are 
 we to do with her she is like a mad woman when you are away see anything remember anything she went on repeating her usual phrases look anna timofeevna she added to her companion see what a box for cards my son has brought us 
 belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material 
 though pierre natasha nicholas countess mary and denisov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess not that anything was hidden from her but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times that was dead and was married which she would again be unable to remember yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit and pierre answered the countess questions as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent 
 conversation of this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidable continued all through teatime all the members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided beside the samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room at tea all sat in their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi bitch daughter of the first milka with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever lay on the armchair beside him denisov whose curly hair mustache and whiskers had turned half gray sat beside countess mary with his tunic unbuttoned pierre sat between his wife and the old countess he spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand he told her of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real living and distinct group but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years but to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society natasha saw by animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess denisov not being a member of the family did not understand caution and being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring in petersburg kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in the semenovsk regiment then about arakcheev and then about the bible society once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna 
 well and all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova denisov asked is that weally still going on 
 going on pierre exclaimed why more than ever the bible society is the whole government now 
 what is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal what are you saying about the government i understand 
 well you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translate things into his language prince alexander golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence they say 
 arakcheev and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now the whole government and what a government they see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything 
 well and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable man i used to meet him at mary said the countess in an offended tone and still more offended that they all remained silent she went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel society well and what harm is there in that and she rose everybody else got up too and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room 
 the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the voices and laughter from the next room evidently some jolly excitement was going on there 
 finished finished little gleeful yell rose above them all 
 pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha he never lost sight of and smiled happily 
 delightful music said he 
 it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said countess mary 
 oh go and see said pierre jumping up you know he added stopping at the door why especially fond of that music it is always the first thing that tells me all is well when i was driving here today the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew as i entered the anteroom i heard peals of laughter and that meant that all was well 
 i know i know that feeling said nicholas but i go there those stockings are to be a surprise for me 
 pierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grew still louder 
 come anna makarovna voice was heard saying come here into the middle of the room and at the word of command one two and when i say three you stand here and you in my arms well now one two said pierre and a silence followed three and a rapturously breathless cry of voices filled the room two two they shouted 
 this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly drew one out of the other in the presence

 the effects of dreams mingled with happiness 
 the lovers saw each other every day 
 cosette came with m is reversing things said mademoiselle gillenormand to have the bride come to the house to do the courting like this 
 but marius convalescence had caused the habit to become established and the of the rue des better adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the rue de arme had rooted it 
 marius and m fauchelevent saw each other but did not address each other it seemed as though this had been agreed upon 
 every girl needs a chaperon 
 cosette could not have come without m fauchelevent in marius eyes m fauchelevent was the condition attached to cosette he accepted it 
 by dint of discussing political matters vaguely and without precision from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all men they came to say a little more than yes and no 
 once on the subject of education which marius wished to have free and obligatory multiplied under all forms lavished on every one like the air and the sun in a word respirable for the entire population they were in unison and they almost conversed m fauchelevent talked well and even with a certain loftiness of he lacked something indescribable 
 m fauchelevent possessed something less and also something more than a man of the world 
 marius inwardly and in the depths of his thought surrounded with all sorts of mute questions this m fauchelevent who was to him simply benevolent and cold 
 there were moments when doubts as to his own recollections occurred to him 
 there was a void in his memory a black spot an abyss excavated by four months of things had been lost therein 
 he had come to the point of asking himself whether it were really a fact that he had seen m fauchelevent so serious and so calm a man in the barricade 
 this was not however the only stupor which the apparitions and the disappearances of the past had left in his mind 
 it must not be supposed that he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which force us even when happy even when satisfied to glance sadly behind us 
 the head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that have vanished contains neither thought nor love 
 at times marius clasped his face between his hands and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the twilight which reigned in his brain 
 again he beheld mabeuf fall he heard gavroche singing amid the he felt beneath his lips the cold brow of eponine enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire combeferre bossuet grantaire all his friends rose erect before him then dispersed into thin air 
 were all those dear sorrowful valiant charming or tragic beings merely dreams had they actually existed 
 the revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke these great fevers create great dreams 
 he questioned himself he felt himself all these vanished realities made him dizzy where were they all then was it really true that all were dead a fall into the shadows had carried off all except himself it all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre 
 there are curtains like this which drop in life god passes on to the following act 
 and he he actually the same man 
 he the poor man was rich he the abandoned had a family he the despairing was to marry cosette 
 it seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb and that he had entered into it black and had emerged from it white and in that tomb the others had remained 
 at certain moments all these beings of the past returned and present formed a circle around him and overshadowed him then he thought of cosette and recovered his serenity but nothing less than this felicity could have sufficed to efface that catastrophe 
 m fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings marius hesitated to believe that the fauchelevent of the barricade was the same as this fauchelevent in flesh and blood sitting so gravely beside cosette 
 the first was probably one of those nightmares occasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium however the natures of both men were rigid no question from marius to m fauchelevent was possible 
 such an idea had not even occurred to him 
 we have already indicated this characteristic detail 
 two men who have a secret in common and who by a sort of tacit agreement exchange not a word on the subject are less rare than is commonly supposed 
 once only did marius make the attempt 
 he introduced into the conversation the rue de la chanvrerie and turning to m fauchelevent he said to him 
 of course you are acquainted with that street 
 what street 
 the rue de la chanvrerie 
 i have no idea of the name of that street replied m fauchelevent in the most natural manner in the world 
 the response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the street itself appeared to marius to be more conclusive than it really was 
 decidedly thought he i have been dreaming 
 i have been subject to a hallucination 
 it was some one who resembled him m fauchelevent was not there

 first epilogue 
 chapter xiv 
 
 soon after this the children came in to say good night they kissed everyone the tutors and governesses made their bows and they went out only young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs 
 no monsieur dessalles i will ask my aunt to let me stay replied nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper 
 ma tante please let me stay said he going up to his aunt 
 his face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess mary glanced at him and turned to pierre 
 when you are here he tear himself away she said 
 i will bring him to you directly monsieur dessalles good night said pierre giving his hand to the swiss tutor and he turned to young nicholas with a smile you and i seen anything of one another yet how like he is growing mary he added addressing countess mary 
 like my father asked the boy flushing crimson and looking up at pierre with bright ecstatic eyes 
 pierre nodded and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted countess mary sat down doing woolwork natasha did not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov rose asked for their pipes smoked went to fetch more tea from sonya who sat weary but resolute at the samovar and questioned pierre the delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner starting every now and then and muttering something to himself and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head with his thin neck exposed by his collar toward the place where pierre sat 
 the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power in which most people see the chief interest of home politics denisov dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg which seemed to him stupid and made forcible and sharp comments on what pierre told them 
 one used to have to be a german now one must dance with tatawinova and madame kwudener and wead and the bwethwen oh they should let that fine fellow bonaparte lose knock all this nonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment to a fellow like that he cried 
 nicholas though free from readiness to find fault with everything also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter and the fact that a had been appointed minister of this and b governor general of that and that the emperor had said and this minister seemed to him very important and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question pierre the questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles 
 but natasha knowing all her ways and ideas saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend prince theodore and she helped him by asking how his affairs with prince theodore had gone 
 what was it about asked nicholas 
 always the same thing said pierre looking round at his listeners everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can 
 what can decent men do nicholas inquired frowning slightly what can be done 
 why this 
 come into my study said nicholas 
 natasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess mary followed her the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window 
 well what would you do asked denisov 
 always some fantastic schemes said nicholas 
 why this began pierre not sitting down but pacing the room sometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position in petersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone now he seeks only for peace and only these people sans foi ni loi can give it him people who recklessly hack at and strangle everything magnitski arakcheev and tutti quanti you will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attained he said to nicholas 
 without faith or law 
 well what does that lead up to said nicholas 
 well everything is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in the army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the people are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young and honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break said pierre as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments began i told them just one thing in petersburg 
 told whom 
 well you know whom said pierre with a meaning glance from under his brows prince theodore and all those to encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed 
 at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his face darkened and he went up to the boy 
 why are you here 
 why let him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and continuing that is not enough i told them something else is needed when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved one is lured by women another by honors a third by ambition or money and they go over to that camp no independent men such as you or i are left what i say is widen the scope of our society let the mot be not virtue alone but independence and action as well 
 nicholas who had left his nephew irritably pushed up an armchair sat down in it and listened to pierre coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more 
 but action with what aim he cried and what position will you adopt toward the government 
 why the position of assistants the society need not be secret if the government allows it not merely is it not hostile to government but it is a society of true conservatives a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word it is only to prevent some pugachev or other from killing my children and yours and arakcheev from sending me off to some military settlement we join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety 
 yes but a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm 
 why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then venture to suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund is an alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what christ preached on the cross 
 natasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at her husband it was not what he was saying that pleased her that did not even interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from whole soul but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad 
 the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the collar whom everyone had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy every word of burned into his heart and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his table 
 it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german tugendbund was and what i am proposing 
 no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters but i understand it and even pwonounce it interposed denisov in a loud and resolute voice i agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i understand if not satisfied let us have a bunt of our own all wight je suis homme 
 your man 
 pierre smiled natasha began to laugh but nicholas knitted his brows still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his imagination pierre maintained the contrary and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered this made him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason of the justice of his opinion 
 i will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finally abandoning the attempt i prove it to you you say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i see it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter and to that i reply you are my best friend as you know but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government and if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down i should not hesitate an instant but should do it and you may argue about that as you like 
 an awkward silence followed these words natasha was the first to speak defending her husband and attacking her brother her defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was resumed and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas last remark 
 when they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski went up to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes 
 uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree with you he asked 
 and pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation and remembering all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to give him an answer 
 yes i think so he said reluctantly and left the study 
 the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholas 
 uncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens 
 nicholas started angrily 
 all right all right he said throwing the bits under the table 
 and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned away from the boy 
 you ought not to have been here at all he said

 two men impossible to find 
 marius enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind other 
 while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be made 
 he owed gratitude in various quarters he owed it on his account he owed it on his own 
 there was thenardier there was the unknown man who had brought him marius back to m gillenormand 
 marius endeavored to find these two men not intending to marry to be happy and to forget them and fearing that were these debts of gratitude not discharged they would leave a shadow on his life which promised so brightly for the future 
 it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain a quittance from the past 
 that thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he had saved colonel pontmercy 
 thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius 
 and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of waterloo was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father so far as thenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any gratitude 
 none of the various agents whom marius employed succeeded in discovering any trace of thenardier 
 obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter 
 madame thenardier had died in prison pending the trial 
 thenardier and his daughter azelma the only two remaining of that lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom the gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those beings on the surface there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in and that the plummet may be dropped 
 madame thenardier being dead boulatruelle being eliminated from the case claquesous having disappeared the principal persons accused having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the gorbeau house had come to nothing 
 that affair had remained rather obscure 
 the bench of assizes had been obliged to content themselves with two subordinates 
 panchaud alias printanier alias bigrenaille and alias who had been inconsistently condemned after a hearing of both sides of the case to ten years in the galleys 
 hard labor for life had been the sentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices 
 thenardier the head and leader had been through contumacy likewise condemned to death 
 this sentence was the only information remaining about thenardier casting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a bier 
 moreover by thrusting thenardier back into the very remotest depths through a fear of being this sentence added to the density of the shadows which enveloped this man 
 as for the other person as for the unknown man who had saved marius the researches were at first to some extent successful then came to an abrupt conclusion 
 they succeeded in finding the carriage which had brought marius to the rue des on the evening of the th of june 
 the coachman declared that on the th of june in obedience to the commands of a he had stood from three in the afternoon until nightfall on the quai des above the outlet of the grand sewer that towards nine in the evening the grating of the sewer which abuts on the bank of the river had opened that a man had emerged therefrom bearing on his shoulders another man who seemed to be dead that the agent who was on the watch at that point had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man that at the order of the he the coachman had taken all those folks into his carriage that they had first driven to the rue des that they had there deposited the dead man that the dead man was monsieur marius and that he the coachman recognized him perfectly although he was alive this time that afterwards they had entered the vehicle again that he had whipped up his horses a few paces from the gate of the archives they had called to him to halt that there in the street they had paid him and left him and that the had led the other man away that he knew nothing more that the night had been very dark 
 marius as we have said recalled nothing 
 he only remembered that he had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he was falling backwards into the barricade then everything vanished so far as he was concerned 
 he had only regained consciousness at m 
 he was lost in conjectures 
 he could not doubt his own identity 
 still how had it come to pass that having fallen in the rue de la chanvrerie he had been picked up by the on the banks of the seine near the pont des invalides 
 some one had carried him from the quartier des halles to the and how 
 through the sewer 
 devotion 
 some one 
 who 
 this was the man for whom marius was searching 
 of this man who was his savior nothing not a trace not the faintest indication 
 marius although forced to preserve great reserve in that direction pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police 
 there no more than elsewhere did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment 
 the prefecture knew less about the matter than did the they had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the th of june at the mouth of the grand sewer 
 no report of any agent had been received there upon this matter which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable 
 the invention of this fable was attributed to the coachman 
 a coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything even of imagination 
 the fact was assured nevertheless and marius could not doubt it unless he doubted his own identity as we have just said 
 everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable 
 what had become of that man that mysterious man whom the coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious marius and whom the on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent what had become of the agent himself 
 why had this agent preserved silence 
 had the man succeeded in making his escape 
 had he bribed the agent 
 why did this man give no sign of life to marius who owed everything to him his disinterestedness was no less tremendous than his devotion why had not that man appeared again 
 perhaps he was above compensation but no one is above gratitude 
 was he dead 
 who was the man what sort of a face had he 
 no one could tell him this 
 the coachman answered 
 the night was very dark 
 basque and nicolette all in a flutter had looked only at their young master all covered with blood 
 the porter whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of marius had been the only one to take note of the man in question and this is the description that he gave 
 that man was terrible 
 marius had the clothing which he had worn when he had been brought back to his grandfather preserved in the hope that it would prove of service in his researches 
 on examining the coat it was found that one skirt had been torn in a singular way 
 a piece was missing 
 one evening marius was speaking in the presence of cosette and jean valjean of the whole of that singular adventure of the innumerable inquiries which he had made and of the fruitlessness of his efforts the cold countenance of monsieur fauchelevent angered him 
 he exclaimed with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it 
 yes that man whoever he may have been was sublime do you know what he did sir 
 he intervened like an archangel he must have flung himself into the midst of the battle have stolen me away have opened the sewer have dragged me into it and have carried me through it 
 he must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries bent over weighed down in the dark in the than a league and a half sir with a corpse upon his back 
 and with what object with the sole object of saving the corpse 
 and that corpse i was he said to himself 
 there may still be a glimpse of life there perchance i will risk my own existence for that miserable spark and his existence he risked not once but twenty times 
 and every step was a danger 
 the proof of it is that on emerging from the sewer he was arrested 
 do you know sir that that man did all this and he had no recompense to expect 
 what was i 
 an insurgent what was i 
 one of the conquered 
 oh if six hundred thousand francs were mine 
 they are yours interrupted jean valjean 
 well resumed marius i would give them all to find that man once more 
 jean valjean remained silent

 first epilogue 
 chapter xv 
 
 the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies but turned on the subject nicholas liked best recollections of denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them the family separated on the most friendly terms 
 after supper nicholas having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to the bedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at her table writing 
 what are you writing mary nicholas asked 
 countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband 
 she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him 
 a diary nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm bold writing 
 a diary nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up the book 
 it was in french 
 december today when andrusha her eldest boy woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was naughty and obstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then i took the matter in hand i left him alone and began with help to get the other children up telling him that i did not love him for a long time he was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me in his shirt and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket he again began crying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him by tenderness 
 what is a ticket nicholas inquired 
 i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how they have behaved 
 nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and continued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set down everything in the lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now that he read this diary about his children for the first time 
 under the date was entered 
 mitya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he had none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness must tell nicholas this 
 nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diary there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife 
 perhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or even done at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the moral welfare delighted him had nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reach in which she had her being 
 he was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself 
 i quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant look and after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today you in the study we began disputing pierre and i and i lost my temper but he is impossible such a child i know what would become of him if natasha keep him in hand have you any idea why he went to petersburg they have formed 
 yes i know said countess mary natasha told me 
 well then you know nicholas went on growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it is every honest duty to go against the government and that the oath of allegiance and duty i am sorry you there they all fell on me denisov and natasha natasha is absurd how she rules over him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats his sayings added nicholas yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying about natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife 
 yes i have noticed that said countess mary 
 when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he started proving goodness knows what a pity you were not there what would you have said 
 as i see it you were quite right and i told natasha so pierre says everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it is our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there said countess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us duties indicated to us by god himself and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children 
 yes it just what i said to him put in nicholas who fancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own view love of neighbor and christianity and all this in the presence of young nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all my things 
 ah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas said countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am afraid i neglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations while he has no one he is constantly alone with his thoughts 
 well i think you need reproach yourself on his account all that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine lad this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and fancy as we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits and he told me of it himself at once i never knew him to tell an untruth a fine lad a fine lad repeated nicholas who at heart was not fond of nicholas bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad 
 still i am not the same as his own mother said countess mary i feel i am not the same and it troubles me a wonderful boy but i am dreadfully afraid for him it would be good for him to have companions 
 well it be for long next summer take him to petersburg said nicholas yes pierre always was a dreamer and always will be he continued returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him well what business is it of mine what goes on there whether arakcheev is bad and all that what business was it of mine when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with prison and had a mother who could not see or understand it and then there are you and the children and our affairs is it for my own pleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to night no but i know i must work to comfort my mother to repay you and not to leave the children such beggars as i was 
 countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters but she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so she only took his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts and after a few minutes reflection continued to think aloud 
 you know mary today elias mitrofanych this was his overseer came back from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest 
 and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of repurchasing otradnoe before long and added another ten years of life and i shall leave the children in an excellent position 
 countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else but she had to force herself to attend for what he was saying did not interest her at all she looked at him and did not think but felt about something different she felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her plans thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind she thought of her nephew her account of the agitation while pierre was speaking struck her forcibly and various traits of his gentle sensitive character recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children she did not compare them with him but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young nicholas 
 sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible in this life to love her husband her children little nicholas and all her neighbors as christ loved mankind countess soul always strove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and could therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the lofty secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face nicholas gazed at her o god what will become of us if she dies as i always fear when her face is like that thought he and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers

 book sleepless night 
 chapter i 
 
 the th of february 
 the night of the th to the th of february was a blessed night above its shadows heaven stood open 
 it was the wedding night of marius and cosette 
 the day had been adorable 
 it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling 
 the manner of marriage in was not the same as it is france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off wife of fleeing on coming out of church of hiding oneself with shame from happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisiteness and decency of jolting their paradise in a of breaking up their mystery with of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn and of leaving behind them in a commonplace chamber at so much a night the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled with the of the conductor of the diligence and the of the inn 
 in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living the mayor and his scarf the priest and his chasuble the law and god no longer suffice they must be eked out by the postilion de lonjumeau a blue waistcoat turned up with red and with bell buttons a plaque like a vantbrace of green leather oaths to the norman horses with their tails knotted up false galloons varnished hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility and raining down on the of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of shoes in memory of churchill afterwards marlborough or malbrouck who was assailed on his by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck 
 old shoes and slippers do not as yet form a part of our nuptial celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall come to that 
 in a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full trot 
 strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness 
 and people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes 
 the marriage took place therefore in accordance with this now superannuated fashion at m house 
 natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church produce some complication 
 they could not get ready before the th of february 
 now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact it chanced that the th fell on shrove tuesday 
 hesitations scruples particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand 
 shrove tuesday exclaimed the grandfather so much the better there is a proverb 
 mariage un mardi gras 
 point enfants ingrats 
 a marriage will have no ungrateful children 
 let us proceed 
 here goes for the th 
 do you want to delay marius 
 no certainly not replied the lover 
 let us marry then cried the grandfather 
 accordingly the marriage took place on the th notwithstanding the public merrymaking 
 it rained that day but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness which lovers see even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella 
 on the preceding evening jean valjean handed to marius in the presence of m gillenormand the five hundred and thousand francs 
 as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property the papers had been simple 
 henceforth toussaint was of no use to jean valjean cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of maid 
 as for jean valjean a beautiful chamber in the gillenormand house had been furnished expressly for him and cosette had said to him in such an irresistible manner 
 father i entreat you that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it 
 a few days before that fixed on for the marriage an accident happened to jean valjean he crushed the thumb of his right hand this was not a serious matter and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself about it nor to dress it nor even to see his hurt not even cosette 
 nevertheless this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage and to carry his arm in a sling and had prevented his signing 
 m gillenormand in his capacity of had supplied his place 
 we will not conduct the reader either to the office or to the church 
 one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent and one is accustomed to turn back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding nosegay in its buttonhole 
 we will confine ourselves to noting an incident which though unnoticed by the wedding party marked the transit from the rue des to the church of 
 at that epoch the northern extremity of the rue was in process of repaving 
 it was barred off beginning with the rue du it was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to they were obliged to alter their course and the simplest way was to turn through the boulevard 
 one of the invited guests observed that it was shrove tuesday and that there would be a jam of asked m of the maskers capital said the grandfather let us go that way 
 these young folks are on the way to be married they are about to enter the serious part of life 
 this will prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade 
 they went by way of the boulevard 
 the first wedding coach held cosette and aunt gillenormand m gillenormand and jean valjean marius still separated from his betrothed according to usage did not come until the second 
 the nuptial train on emerging from the rue des became entangled in a long procession of vehicles which formed an endless chain from the madeleine to the bastille and from the bastille to the madeleine maskers abounded on the boulevard 
 in spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals pantaloon and clown persisted in the good humor of that winter of paris had disguised itself as venice 
 such shrove tuesdays are no longer to be seen everything which exists being a scattered carnival there is no longer any carnival 
 the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators 
 the terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were bordered with spectators 
 besides the maskers they stared at that to shrove tuesday as to longchamps of vehicles of every description citadines tapissieres carioles cabriolets marching in order rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations and locked into rails as it were any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current those two brooks of carriages flowing the one down stream the other up stream the one towards the chaussee the other towards the faubourg the carriages of the peers of france and of the ambassadors emblazoned with coats of arms held the middle of the way going and coming freely 
 certain joyous and magnificent trains notably that of the boeuf gras had the same privilege 
 in this gayety of paris england cracked her whip lord harassed by a nickname from the populace passed with great noise 
 in the double file along which the municipal guards galloped like honest family coaches loaded down with and grandmothers displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in disguise clowns of seven years of age columbines of six ravishing little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of the public mirth who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade and who possessed the gravity of functionaries 
 from time to time a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of vehicles one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot was disentangled one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line 
 then they set out again on the march 
 the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the bastille and skirting the right side of the boulevard 
 at the top of the there was a stoppage 
 nearly at the same moment the other file which was proceeding towards the madeleine halted also 
 at that point of the file there was a of maskers 
 these carriages or to speak more correctly these of maskers are very familiar to parisians 
 if they were missing on a shrove tuesday or at the it would be taken in bad part and people would say 
 something behind that 
 probably the ministry is about to undergo a change 
 a pile of cassandras harlequins and columbines jolted along high above the all possible grotesquenesses from the turk to the savage hercules supporting marquises fishwives who would have made rabelais stop up his ears just as the maenads made aristophanes drop his eyes tow wigs pink tights dandified hats spectacles of a grimacer hats of janot tormented with a butterfly shouts directed at pedestrians fists on hips bold attitudes bare shoulders immodesty unchained a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers this is what that institution was like 
 greece stood in need of the chariot of thespis france stands in need of the of vade 
 everything can be parodied even parody 
 the saturnalia that grimace of antique beauty ends through exaggeration after exaggeration in shrove tuesday and the bacchanal formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves and grapes inundated with sunshine displaying her marble breast in a divine having at the present day lost her shape under the soaked rags of the north has finally come to be called the 
 the tradition of of maskers runs back to the most ancient days of the monarchy 
 the accounts of louis xi allot to the bailiff of the palace twenty sous tournois for three coaches of mascarades in the in our day these noisy heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage whose imperial they load down or they overwhelm a hired landau with its top thrown back with their tumultuous groups 
 twenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six 
 they cling to the seats to the rumble on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts 
 they even bestride the carriage lamps 
 they stand sit lie with their knees drawn up in a knot and their legs hanging 
 the women sit on the laps far away above the throng of heads their wild pyramid is visible these form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout 
 colle panard and piron flow from it enriched with slang this carriage which has become colossal through its freight has an air of conquest 
 uproar reigns in front tumult behind people vociferate shout howl there they break forth and writhe with enjoyment gayety roars sarcasm flames forth joviality is flaunted like a red flag two jades there drag farce blossomed forth into an apotheosis it is the triumphal car of laughter 
 a laughter that is too cynical to be frank 
 in truth this laughter is suspicious 
 this laughter has a mission it is charged with proving the carnival to the parisians 
 these fishwife vehicles in which one feels one knows not what shadows set the philosopher to thinking 
 there is government therein there one lays finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and public women 
 it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of gayety that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be enticed that the system of spying and serving as caryatids to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags half dung half light roll by on four wheels howling and laughing that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames that there would be no festival for the populace did not the police promenade in their midst these sorts of hydras of joy but what can be done about it 
 these and tumbrils of mire are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace 
 and populaces like tyrants require buffoons the king has roquelaure the populace has the paris is a great mad city on every occasion that it is a great sublime city there the carnival forms part of politics 
 us confess allows infamy to furnish it with comedy she only demands of her she has thing paint me the mud 
 rome was of the same mind 
 she loved nero nero was a titanic lighterman 
 chance ordained as we have just said that one of these shapeless clusters of masked men and women dragged about on a vast calash should halt on the left of the boulevard while the wedding train halted on the right 
 the of masks caught sight of the wedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the boulevard 
 hullo said a masker a wedding 
 a sham wedding retorted another 
 we are the genuine article 
 and being too far off to accost the wedding party and fearing also the rebuke of the police the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere 
 at the end of another minute the of maskers had their hands full the multitude set to yelling which is the caress to masquerades and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace 
 a frightful exchange of metaphors took place between the maskers and the crowd 
 in the meanwhile two other maskers in the same carriage a spaniard with an enormous nose an elderly air and huge black moustache and a gaunt fishwife who was quite a young girl masked with a loup had also noticed the wedding and while their companions and the were exchanging insults they had held a dialogue in a low voice 
 a short mask 
 their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle which was wide open the breezes of february are not warm as the fishwife clad in a gown replied to the spaniard she shivered laughed and coughed 
 here is their dialogue 
 say now 
 what daddy 
 do you see that old cove 
 what old cove 
 yonder in the first on our side 
 the one with his arm hung up in a black cravat 
 yes 
 well 
 sure that i know him 
 ah 
 willing that they should cut my throat and ready to swear that i never said either you thou or i in my life if i know that parisian 
 pantinois 
 paris in pantin 
 can you see the bride if you stoop down 
 no 
 and the bridegroom 
 no bridegroom in that trap 
 bah 
 unless the old fellow 
 try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low 
 i 
 never mind that old cove who has something the matter with his paw i know and that positive 
 and what good does it do to know him 
 no one can tell 
 sometimes it does 
 i care a hang for old fellows that i 
 i know him 
 know him if you want to 
 how the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party 
 we are in it too 
 where does that wedding come from 
 how should i know 
 listen 
 well what 
 one thing you ought to do 
 that 
 get off of our trap and spin that wedding 
 what for 
 to find out where it goes and what it is 
 hurry up and jump down trot my girl your legs are young 
 i quit the vehicle 
 why not 
 hired 
 ah the devil 
 i owe my fishwife day to the prefecture 
 true 
 if i leave the cart the first inspector who gets his eye on me will arrest me 
 you know that well enough 
 yes i do 
 bought by the government for 
 all the same that old fellow bothers me 
 do the old fellows bother you 
 but not a young girl 
 in the first carriage 
 well 
 in the trap 
 what then 
 so he is the father 
 what concern is that of mine 
 i tell you that the father 
 as if he were the only father 
 listen 
 what 
 i go out otherwise than masked 
 here concealed no one knows that here 
 but there will be no more maskers ash wednesday 
 i run the risk of being nabbed 
 i must sneak back into my hole 
 but you are free 
 not particularly 
 more than i am at any rate 
 well what of that 
 you must try to find out where that went to 
 where it went 
 yes 
 i know 
 where is it going then 
 to the 
 in the first place not in that direction 
 well to la rapee 
 or elsewhere 
 free 
 are at liberty 
 not the point at all 
 i tell you that you must try to learn for me what that wedding is who that old cove belongs to and where that wedding pair lives 
 i like that that would be queer 
 so easy to find out a that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday a week afterwards 
 a pin in a it possible 
 that matter 
 you must try 
 you understand me azelma 
 the two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard in opposite directions and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the trap of the bride

 first epilogue 
 chapter xvi 
 
 natasha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity understanding and expressing each thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and in a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he began proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and she led on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel 
 from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom saying now you are all mine mine you escape from that moment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another 
 just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them 
 natasha spoke to pierre about her life and doings of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she was fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than herself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging superiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on pierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all other women and that now especially after having seen many women in petersburg he should tell her so afresh 
 pierre answering words told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg 
 i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it was simply dull besides i was very busy 
 natasha looked intently at him and went on 
 mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya was naughty 
 how like his father he is pierre interjected 
 natasha knew why he mentioned likeness to nicholas the recollection of his dispute with his was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought of it 
 nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line said she repeating words pierre had once uttered 
 no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement almost a pastime said pierre for instance he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he began to soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary 
 so you say ideas are an amusement to him 
 yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is mere amusement 
 ah so sorry i there when you met the children said natasha which was most delighted lisa sure 
 yes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholas says we ought not to think but i help it besides when i was in petersburg i felt i can this to you that the whole affair would go to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own way but i succeeded in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see i say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be but one banner that of active virtue prince sergey is a fine fellow and clever 
 natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of idea but one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband how did this happen she wished to express this doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon karataev 
 do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platon karataev would he have approved of you now do you think 
 pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood his line of thought 
 platon karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying to imagine opinion on the subject he would not have understood yet perhaps he would 
 i love you awfully natasha suddenly said awfully awfully 
 no he would not have approved said pierre after reflection what he would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxious to find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and i should have been proud to let him see us there now you talk of my absence but you believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation 
 yes i should think natasha began 
 no not that i never leave off loving you and one love more but this is something special yes of course he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest 
 what nonsense it is natasha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons and that the greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is the best of all if only you did not go away do you remember how we quarreled and it was always my fault always mine and what we quarreled about i even remember 
 always about the same thing said pierre with a smile jealo 
 say it i bear it natasha cried and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively did you see her she added after a pause 
 no and if i had i have recognized her 
 they were silent for a while 
 oh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking at you natasha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them you are as like him as two peas like the boy she meant her little son oh time to go to him the come but sorry to leave you 
 they were silent for a few seconds then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak pierre began with and enthusiasm natasha with a quiet happy smile having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue 
 no what did you say go on go on 
 no you go on i was talking nonsense said natasha 
 pierre finished what he had begun it was the sequel to his complacent reflections on his success in petersburg at that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russian society and to the whole world 
 i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones my whole idea is that if vicious people are united and constitute a power then honest folk must do the same now simple enough 
 yes 
 and what were you going to say 
 i only nonsense 
 but all the same 
 oh nothing only a trifle said natasha smilingly still more brightly i only wanted to tell you about petya today nurse was coming to take him from me and he laughed shut his eyes and clung to me sure he thought he was hiding awfully sweet there now crying well and she left the room 
 meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual the boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring little nicholas who had just waked up in a cold perspiration sat up in bed and gazed before him with eyes he had awaked from a terrible dream he had dreamed that he and uncle pierre wearing helmets such as were depicted in his plutarch were leading a huge army the army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which dessalles called les fils de la vierge in front was glory which was similar to those threads but rather thicker he and pierre were borne along lightly and joyously nearer and nearer to their goal suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move and uncle nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude 
 have you done this he said pointing to some broken sealing wax and pens i loved you but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill the first of you who moves forward little nicholas turned to look at pierre but pierre was no longer there in his place was his father prince andrew and his father had neither shape nor form but he existed and when little nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love he felt himself powerless limp and formless his father caressed and pitied him but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to them terror seized young nicholas and he awoke 
 my father he thought though there were two good portraits of prince andrew in the house nicholas never imagined him in human form my father has been with me and caressed me he approved of me and of uncle pierre whatever he may tell me i will do it mucius scaevola burned his hand why should not the same sort of thing happen to me i know they want me to learn and i will learn but someday i shall have finished learning and then i will do something i only pray god that something may happen to me such as happened to men and i will act as they did i will do better everyone shall know me love me and be delighted with me and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry 
 are you ill he heard dessalles voice asking 
 no answered nicholas and lay back on his pillow 
 he is good and kind and i am fond of him he thought of dessalles but uncle pierre oh what a wonderful man he is and my father oh father father yes i will do something with which even he would be satisfied

 book sleepless night 
 chapter ii 
 
 jean valjean still wears his arm in a sling 
 to realize dream 
 to whom is this accorded 
 there must be elections for this in heaven we are all candidates unknown to ourselves the angels vote 
 cosette and marius had been elected 
 cosette both at the office and at church was dazzling and touching 
 toussaint assisted by nicolette had dressed her 
 cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta her robe of binche guipure a veil of english point a necklace of fine pearls a wreath of orange flowers all this was white and from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth 
 it was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light 
 one would have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess 
 marius handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed here and there beneath the thick curls pale scars of the barricade were visible 
 the grandfather haughty with head held high amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of barras escorted cosette 
 he took the place of jean valjean who on account of his arm being still in a sling could not give his hand to the bride 
 jean valjean dressed in black followed them with a smile 
 monsieur fauchelevent said the grandfather to him this is a fine day 
 i vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows henceforth there must be no sadness anywhere 
 pardieu i decree joy evil has no right to exist 
 that there should be any unhappy men is in sooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky 
 evil does not come from man who is good at bottom 
 all human miseries have for their capital and central government hell otherwise known as the tuileries 
 good here i am uttering demagogical words as far as i am concerned i have no longer any political opinions let all me be rich that is to say mirthful and i confine myself to that 
 when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy after having exchanged their rings after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer they arrived hand in hand admired and envied by all marius in black she in white preceded by the suisse with the epaulets of a colonel tapping the pavement with his halberd between two rows of astonished spectators at the portals of the church both leaves of which were thrown wide open ready to enter their carriage again and all being finished cosette still could not believe that it was real 
 she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky 
 it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream 
 her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty they entered the same carriage to return home marius beside cosette m gillenormand and jean valjean sat opposite them aunt gillenormand had withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle 
 my children said the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron and madame la baronne with an income of thirty thousand livres 
 and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic whisper 
 so it is true 
 my name is marius 
 i am madame thou 
 these two creatures were resplendent 
 they had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy 
 they realized the verses of jean prouvaire they were forty years old taken together 
 it was marriage sublimated these two children were two lilies 
 they did not see each other they did not contemplate each other 
 cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory marius perceived cosette on an altar and on that altar and in that glory the two apotheoses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the real thing the meeting of the kiss and the dream the nuptial pillow all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication 
 it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless nights their tears their anguish their terrors their despair converted into caresses and rays of light rendered still more charming 
 the charming hour which was approaching and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy how good it is to have suffered 
 their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness 
 the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension 
 it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuousness in marius and with modesty in cosette 
 they said to each other in low tones 
 we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plumet 
 the folds of gown lay across marius 
 such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality one possesses and one supposes 
 one still has time before one to divine the emotion on that day of being at and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable 
 the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd and inspired the with cheerfulness 
 people halted in the rue in front of to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the quivering on head 
 then they returned home to the rue des marius triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition 
 the poor who had trooped to the door and who shared their purses blessed them there were flowers everywhere 
 the house was no less fragrant than the church after the incense roses 
 they thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite they had god in their hearts destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun 
 all at once the clock struck marius glanced at charming bare arm and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice and cosette intercepting marius glance blushed to her very hair 
 quite a number of old family friends of the gillenormand family had been invited they pressed about cosette 
 each one vied with the rest in saluting her as madame la baronne 
 the officer theodule gillenormand now a captain had come from chartres where he was stationed in garrison to be present at the wedding of his cousin pontmercy 
 cosette did not recognize him 
 he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman 
 how right i was not to believe in that story about the lancer said father gillenormand to himself 
 cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean she was in unison with father gillenormand while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume happiness desires that all the world should be happy 
 she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl she caressed him with her smile 
 a banquet had been spread in the 
 illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of a great joy 
 mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy they do not consent to be black 
 the night yes the shadows no if there is no sun one must be made 
 the was full of gay things 
 in the centre above the white and glittering table was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the candles around the chandelier girandoles on the walls sconces with triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate porcelain faience pottery gold and work all was sparkling and gay 
 the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets so that where there was not a light there was a flower 
 in the antechamber three violins and a flute softly played quartettes by haydn 
 jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him 
 a few moments before they sat down to table cosette came as though inspired by a sudden whim and made him a deep courtesy spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tenderly roguish glance she asked him 
 father are you satisfied 
 yes said jean valjean i am content 
 well then laugh 
 jean valjean began to laugh 
 a few moments later basque announced that dinner was served 
 the guests preceded by m gillenormand with cosette on his arm entered the and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table 
 two large figured on the right and left of the bride the first for m gillenormand the other for jean valjean m gillenormand took his seat 
 the other remained empty 
 they looked about for m fauchelevent 
 he was no longer there 
 m gillenormand questioned basque 
 do you know where m fauchelevent is 
 sir replied basque i do precisely 
 m fauchelevent told me to say to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was paining him somewhat and that he could not dine with monsieur le baron and madame la baronne 
 that he begged to be excused that he would come he has just taken his departure 
 that empty chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment 
 but if m fauchelevent was absent m gillenormand was present and the grandfather beamed for two he affirmed that m fauchelevent had done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a slight ailment this declaration sufficed 
 moreover what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy 
 cosette and marius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness and then an idea occurred to m this armchair is empty 
 come hither marius 
 your aunt will permit it although she has a right to you 
 this armchair is for you that is legal and delightful 
 fortunatus beside fortunata applause from the whole table 
 marius took jean place beside cosette and things fell out so that cosette who had at first been saddened by jean absence ended by being satisfied with it 
 from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself she set her sweet little foot shod in white satin on marius foot 
 the being occupied m fauchelevent was obliterated and nothing was lacking 
 and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness 
 at dessert m gillenormand rising to his feet with a glass of champagne in his half full so that the palsy of his eighty years might not cause an the health of the married pair 
 you shall not escape two sermons he exclaimed 
 this morning you had one from the cure this evening you shall have one from your grandfather 
 listen to me i will give you a bit of advice adore each other

 because it is a gewgaw 
 ah you are the nineteenth century 
 well what then and we have been as foolish as you 
 do not imagine that you have effected much change in the universe because your is called the and because your pourree is called the cachuca in fact the women must always be loved 
 i defy you to escape from that these friends are our angels 
 yes love woman the kiss forms a circle from which i defy you to escape and for my own part i should be only too happy to it 
 which of you has seen the planet venus the coquette of the abyss the celimene of the ocean rise in the infinite calming all here below the ocean is a rough alcestis 
 well grumble as he will when venus appears he is forced to smile 
 that brute beast submits 
 we are all made so 
 wrath tempest claps of thunder foam to the very ceiling a woman enters on the scene a planet rises flat on your face marius was fighting six months ago he is married that is well 
 yes marius yes cosette you are in the right exist boldly for each other make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same idealize each other catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth and arrange yourselves a nest for life 
 pardi to love to be loved what a fine miracle when one is young 
 imagine that you have invented that 
 i too have had my dream i too have meditated i too have sighed i too have had a moonlight soul 
 love is a child six thousand years old love has the right to a long white beard 
 methusalem is a street arab beside cupid 
 for sixty centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by loving 
 the devil who is cunning took to hating man man who is still more cunning took to loving woman in this way he does more good than the devil does him harm this craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise the invention is old my friends but it is perfectly new 
 profit by it be daphnis and chloe while waiting to become philemon and baucis manage so that when you are with each other nothing shall be lacking to you and that cosette may be the sun for marius and that marius may be the universe to cosette 
 cosette let your fine weather be the smile of your husband marius let your rain be your tears 
 and let it never rain in your household you have filched the winning number in the lottery you have gained the great prize guard it well keep it under lock and key do not squander it adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest 
 believe what i say to you 
 it is good sense and good sense cannot lie 
 be a religion to each other each man has his own fashion of adoring god 
 saperlotte the best way to adore god is to love wife 
 i love thee my catechism 
 he who loves is orthodox 
 the oath of henri iv places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness i belong to the religion of that oath woman is forgotten in it 
 this astonishes me on the part of henri iv 
 my friends long live women 
 i am old they say astonishing how much i feel in the mood to be young 
 i should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods 
 children who contrive to be beautiful and intoxicates me i would like greatly to get married if any one would have me it is impossible to imagine that god could have made us for anything but this 
 to idolize to coo to preen ourselves to be to be dainty to bill and coo our loves from morn to night to gaze at image in little wife to be proud to be triumphant to plume oneself that is the aim of life 
 there let not that displease you which we used to think in our day when we were young folks ah what charming women there were in those days and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses 
 i committed my ravages among them 
 then love each other 
 if people did not love each other i really do not see what use there would be in having any springtime and for my own part i should pray the good god to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us and to take away from us and put back in his box the flowers the birds and the pretty maidens 
 my children receive an old blessing 
 the evening was gay lively and agreeable 
 the sovereign good humor gave the to the whole feast and each person regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality they danced a little they laughed a great deal it was an amiable wedding 
 goodman days of yore might have been invited to it 
 however he was present in the person of father gillenormand 
 there was a tumult then silence 
 the married pair disappeared 
 a little after midnight the gillenormand house became a temple 
 here we pause 
 on the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel with his finger on his lips 
 the soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the celebration of love takes place 
 there should be flashes of light athwart such houses 
 the joy which they contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy and vaguely illuminate the gloom it is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to the infinite 
 love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man and the woman takes place the being one the being triple the being final the human trinity proceeds from it 
 this birth of two souls into one ought to be an emotion for the gloom 
 the lover is the priest the ravished virgin is terrified 
 something of that joy ascends to god where true marriage is that is to say where there is love the ideal enters in 
 a nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life it is probable that we should behold the forms of night the winged unknowns the blue passers of the invisible bend down a throng of sombre heads around the luminous house satisfied showering benedictions pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed sweetly terrified and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances 
 if at that supreme hour the wedded pair dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone were to listen they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings 
 perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels 
 that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling when two mouths rendered sacred by love approach to create it is impossible that there should not be above that ineffable kiss a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars 
 these felicities are the true ones 
 there is no joy outside of these joys 
 love is the only ecstasy 
 all the rest weeps 
 to love or to have suffices 
 demand nothing more there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life to love is a fulfilment

 second epilogue 
 chapter i 
 
 history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put into words to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation appears impossible 
 the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive the life of a people they described the activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation 
 the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined 
 for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the deity in human affairs 
 modern history in theory rejects both these principles 
 it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows them in practice 
 instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very various kinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nations which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity modern history has postulated its own aims the welfare of the french german or english people or in its highest abstraction the welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent 
 modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the same conclusion by another road that is to recognize nations guided by individual men and the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending 
 at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions 
 in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs generals and ministers as being such men while another includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poets secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of the roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equality and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called europe 
 in a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkable symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west paris and subsides 
 during that period an immense number of fields were left untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of men migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions of christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another 
 what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these events what force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period 
 for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves 
 if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply would have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period nor would there have been any contradictions 
 but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers 
 modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what this movement means what caused it and what force produced these events then listen 
 louis xiv was a very proud and man he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain men wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other people at that time there was in france a man of genius napoleon he conquered everybody everywhere that is he killed many people because he was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria and prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there was an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon in he suddenly made friends with him but in they again quarreled and again began killing many people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperor alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace all allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears before his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects 
 it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature of the historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period 
 the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has asked 
 if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples the first question in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is what is the power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was very proud or that certain writers wrote certain books 
 all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is not what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons and writers but we do not acknowledge such a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons and authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations 
 if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be explained in what this new force consists for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force 
 history seems to assume that this force is and known to everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really quite well known to everybody

 book sleepless night 
 chapter iii 
 
 the inseparable 
 what had become of jean valjean 
 immediately after having laughed at graceful command when no one was paying any heed to him jean valjean had risen and had gained the antechamber unperceived 
 this was the very room which eight months before he had entered black with mud with blood and powder bringing back the grandson to the grandfather the old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage and flowers the musicians were seated on the sofa on which they had laid marius down 
 basque in a black coat white stockings and white gloves was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served 
 jean valjean pointed to his arm in its sling charged basque to explain his absence and went away 
 the long windows of the opened on the street jean valjean stood for several minutes erect and motionless in the darkness beneath those radiant windows 
 he listened the confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear 
 he heard the loud commanding tones of the grandfather the violins the clatter of the plates the bursts of laughter and through all that merry uproar he distinguished sweet and joyous voice 
 he quitted the rue des and returned to the rue de arme 
 in order to return thither he took the rue the rue and the it was a little longer but it was the road through which for the last three months he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the rue de arme to the rue des in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the rue 
 this road through which cosette had passed excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary 
 jean valjean entered his lodgings 
 he lighted his candle and mounted the stairs 
 the apartment was empty 
 even toussaint was no longer there 
 jean step made more noise than usual in the chambers 
 all the cupboards stood open he penetrated to bedroom 
 there were no sheets on the bed the pillow covered with ticking and without a case or lace was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress whose covering was visible and on which no one was ever to sleep again all the little feminine objects which cosette was attached to had been carried away nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls 
 bed was despoiled in like manner one bed only was made up and seemed to be waiting some one and this was jean bed 
 jean valjean looked at the walls closed some of the cupboard doors and went and came from one room to another 
 then he sought his own chamber once more and set his candle on a table 
 he had disengaged his arm from the sling and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him 
 he approached his bed and his eyes rested was it by chance was it intentionally on the inseparable of which cosette had been jealous on the little portmanteau which never left him on his arrival in the rue de arme on the th of june he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed he went to this table with a sort of vivacity took a key from his pocket and opened the valise 
 from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which ten years before cosette had quitted montfermeil first the little gown then the black fichu then the stout coarse shoes which cosette might almost have worn still so tiny were her feet then the fustian bodice which was very thick then the knitted petticoat next the apron with pockets then the woollen stockings these stockings which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg were no longer than jean hand 
 all this was black of hue it was he who had brought those garments to montfermeil for her as he removed them from the valise he laid them on the bed he fell to thinking 
 he called up memories 
 it was in winter in a very cold month of december she was shivering in rags her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes he jean valjean had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments 
 the mother must have felt pleased in her grave to see her daughter wearing mourning for her and above all to see that she was properly clothed and that she was warm he thought of that forest of montfermeil they had traversed it together cosette and he he thought of what the weather had been of the leafless trees of the wood destitute of birds of the sunless sky it mattered not it was charming 
 he arranged the tiny garments on the bed the fichu next to the petticoat the stockings beside the shoes and he looked at them one after the other she was no taller than that she had her big doll in her arms she had put her louis in the pocket of that apron she had laughed they walked hand in hand she had no one in the world but him 
 then his venerable white head fell forward on the bed that stoical old heart broke his face was engulfed so to speak in garments and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment he would have heard frightful sobs

 second epilogue 
 chapter ii 
 
 what force moves the nations 
 biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or in general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event the replies they give immediately lose all meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event was produced by power another that it was produced by a third that it was due to the power of some other person besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that power was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians of this class by mutually destroying one positions destroy the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no reply to essential question 
 writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event 
 according to this view the power of historical personages represented as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded as a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an historic character is first the product of his time and his power only the resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a force producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of and other things they do not like were simply the product of misdirected will and that the very ideas of were arrested in their development by caprice the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced power but power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age 
 this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at every step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway 
 to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force the sum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is never observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action 
 specialist historians describing the campaign of or the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside will such as the activity of stein metternich madame de stael talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian evidently decomposes power into the components talleyrand chateaubriand and the rest but the sum of the components that is the interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stael and the others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand madame de stael and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted that is how component forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times a the historian is again obliged to fall back on power the force he had denied and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves 
 peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to whether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the clouds away or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way the universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes when they want to prove something else say that power produces events 
 a third class of historians the historians of culture following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events again take that force to be something quite different they see it in what is called culture in mental activity 
 the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls actions for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love 
 but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea essential question still remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians another newer force the idea is added the connection of which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event 
 undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce handicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion that history is written by learned men and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history and that spiritual activity enlightenment civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory 
 but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious philosophic and political doctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of for instance they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power and say plainly that that was the result of will speaking so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize

 book sleepless night 
 chapter iv 
 
 the immortal liver 
 in allusion to the story of prometheus 
 the old and formidable struggle of which we have already witnessed so many phases began once more 
 jacob struggled with the angel but one night 
 alas how many times have we beheld jean valjean seized bodily by his conscience in the darkness and struggling desperately against it 
 conflict 
 at certain moments the foot slips at other moments the ground crumbles away underfoot 
 how many times had that conscience mad for the good clasped and overthrown him how many times had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast how many times hurled to earth by the light had he begged for mercy how many times had that implacable spark lighted within him and upon him by the bishop dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind 
 how many times had he risen to his feet in the combat held fast to the rock leaning against sophism dragged in the dust now getting the upper hand of his conscience again overthrown by it 
 how many times after an equivoque after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism had he heard his irritated conscience cry in his ear 
 a trip you wretch how many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat under the evidence of duty 
 resistance to god funereal sweats 
 what secret wounds which he alone felt bleed what excoriations in his lamentable existence 
 how many times he had risen bleeding bruised broken enlightened despair in his heart serenity in his soul and vanquished he had felt himself the conqueror 
 and after having dislocated broken and rent his conscience with pincers it had said to him as it stood over him formidable luminous and tranquil 
 now go in peace 
 but on emerging from so melancholy a conflict what a lugubrious peace alas 
 nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat 
 a question presented itself 
 predestinations are not all direct they do not open out in a straight avenue before the predestined man they have blind courts impassable alleys obscure turns disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many ways 
 jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of these crossroads 
 he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil 
 he had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes 
 on this occasion once more as had happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes two roads opened out before him the one tempting the other alarming 
 which was he to take 
 he was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness 
 once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush 
 is it then true the soul may recover but not fate 
 frightful thing an incurable destiny 
 this is the problem which presented itself to him 
 in what manner was jean valjean to behave in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius 
 it was he who had willed that happiness it was he who had brought it about he had himself buried it in his entrails and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his own breast 
 cosette had marius marius possessed cosette 
 they had everything even riches 
 and this was his doing 
 but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that it existed now that it was there 
 should he force himself on this happiness 
 should he treat it as belonging to him no doubt cosette did belong to another but should he jean valjean retain of cosette all that he could retain 
 should he remain the sort of father half seen but respected which he had hitherto been should he without saying a word bring his past to that future should he present himself there as though he had a right and should he seat himself veiled at that luminous fireside should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands with a smile 
 should he place upon the peaceful fender of the gillenormand those feet of his which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law 
 should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of cosette and marius should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense 
 should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity 
 should he continue to hold his peace in a word should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings 
 we must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear to us in all their horrible nakedness 
 good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point 
 what are you going to do demands the sphinx 
 this habit of trial jean valjean possessed 
 he gazed intently at the sphinx 
 he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects 
 cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck what was he to do 
 to cling fast to it or to let go his hold 
 if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from his garments and his hair he was saved he should live 
 and if he let go his hold 
 then the abyss 
 thus he took sad council with his thoughts 
 or to speak more correctly he fought he kicked furiously internally now against his will now against his conviction 
 happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep that relieved him possibly 
 but the beginning was savage a tempest more furious than the one which had formerly driven him to arras broke loose within him 
 the past surged up before him facing the present he compared them and sobbed 
 the silence of tears once opened the despairing man writhed 
 he felt that he had been stopped short 
 alas in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal bewildered furious exasperated at having to yield disputing the ground hoping for a possible flight seeking an escape what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear 
 to feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle 
 the invisible inexorable what an obsession 
 then one is never done with conscience 
 make your choice brutus make your choice cato 
 it is fathomless since it is god one flings into that well the labor of whole life one flings in fortune one flings in riches one flings in success one flings in liberty or fatherland one flings in one flings in repose one flings in joy more more more 
 empty the vase tip the urn 
 one must finish by flinging in heart 
 somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells there is a tun like that 
 is not one pardonable if one at last refuses 
 can the inexhaustible have any right 
 are not chains which are endless above human strength who would blame sisyphus and jean valjean for saying 
 it is enough 
 the obedience of matter is limited by friction is there no limit to the obedience of the soul 
 if perpetual motion is impossible can perpetual be exacted 
 the first step is nothing it is the last which is difficult what was the champmathieu affair in comparison with marriage and of that which it entailed 
 what is a into the galleys compared to entrance into the void 
 oh first step that must be descended how sombre art thou oh second step how black art thou 
 how could he refrain from turning aside his head this time 
 martyrdom is sublimation corrosive sublimation 
 it is a torture which consecrates 
 one can consent to it for the first hour one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron one places on head the crown of hot iron one accepts the globe of red hot iron one takes the sceptre of red hot iron but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering 
 at length jean valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion 
 he weighed he reflected he considered the alternatives the mysterious balance of light and darkness 
 should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself on one side lay the sacrifice of cosette on the other that of himself 
 at what solution should he arrive 
 what decision did he come to 
 what resolution did he take 
 what was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality 
 what door did he decide to open 
 which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning 
 among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him which was his choice 
 what extremity did he accept to which of the gulfs did he nod his head 
 his dizzy revery lasted all night long 
 he remained there until daylight in the same attitude bent double over that bed prostrate beneath the enormity of fate crushed perchance alas with clenched fists with arms outspread at right angles like a man crucified who has been and flung face down on the earth 
 there he remained for twelve hours the twelve long hours of a long night without once raising his head and without uttering a word he was as motionless as a corpse while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared now like the hydra now like the eagle any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead all at once he shuddered convulsively and his mouth glued to garments kissed them then it could be seen that he was alive 
 who could see 
 since jean valjean was alone and there was no one there 
 the one who is in the shadows

 second epilogue 
 chapter iii 
 
 a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says the devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away 
 the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of the contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation 
 the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed 
 the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples 
 yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting from several other forces like the movement of the wheels others again as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown away 
 so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether caesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories of all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end and the only such conception known to historians is that of power 
 this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who breaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other method of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step 
 in dealing with inquiry the science of history up to now is like money in circulation paper money and coin the biographies and special national histories are like paper money they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires by what force did napoleon do this that is wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension 
 the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more than that paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to essential question what is power the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of gold so universal historians and historians of culture not answering essential question serve as currency for some purposes of their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call serious reading

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter i 
 
 the seventh circle and the eighth heaven 
 the days that follow weddings are solitary 
 people respect the meditations of the happy pair 
 and also their tardy slumbers to some degree 
 the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on 
 on the morning of the th of february it was a little past midday when basque with napkin and under his arm busy in setting his antechamber to rights heard a light tap at the door 
 there had been no ring which was discreet on such a day basque opened the door and beheld m fauchelevent 
 he introduced him into the still encumbered and and which bore the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening 
 dame sir remarked basque we all woke up late 
 is your master up asked jean valjean 
 how is arm replied basque 
 better 
 is your master up 
 which one the old one or the new one 
 monsieur pontmercy 
 monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up 
 a man is a baron most of all to his servants 
 he counts for something with them they are what a philosopher would call bespattered with the title and that flatters them 
 marius be it said in passing a militant republican as he had proved was now a baron in spite of himself 
 a small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title 
 it was now m gillenormand who clung to it and marius who detached himself from it but colonel pontmercy had written 
 my son will bear my title marius obeyed 
 and then cosette in whom the woman was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a baroness 
 monsieur le baron repeated basque 
 i will go and see i will tell him that m fauchelevent is here 
 no do not tell him that it is i tell him that some one wishes to speak to him in private and mention no name 
 ah ejaculated basque 
 i wish to surprise him 
 ah ejaculated basque once more emitting his second ah as an explanation of the first 
 and he left the room 
 jean valjean remained alone 
 the as we have just said was in great disorder it seemed as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding 
 on the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and the wax candles burned to stumps added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers 
 not a single piece of furniture was in its place in the corners three or four drawn close together in a circle had the appearance of continuing a conversation the whole effect was cheerful 
 a certain grace still lingers round a dead feast 
 it has been a happy thing 
 on the chairs in disarray among those fading flowers beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy 
 the sun had succeeded to the chandelier and made its way gayly into the 
 several minutes elapsed 
 jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where basque had left him 
 he was very pale 
 his eyes were hollow and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits 
 his black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night 
 the elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it 
 jean valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his feet by the sun 
 there came a sound at the door and he raised his eyes 
 marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant he had not slept either 
 it is you father he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air 
 but you have come too early 
 it is only half past twelve 
 cosette is asleep 
 that word 
 father said to m fauchelevent by marius signified supreme felicity 
 there had always existed as the reader knows a lofty wall a coldness and a constraint between them ice which must be broken or melted 
 marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m fauchelevent was to him as to cosette a father 
 he continued 
 his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms of joy 
 how glad i am to see you 
 if you only knew how we missed you yesterday good morning father 
 how is your hand 
 better is it not 
 and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he pursued 
 we have both been talking about you 
 cosette loves you so dearly you must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to do with the rue de arme 
 we will have no more of it at all how could you go to live in a street like that which is sickly which is disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one is cold and into which one cannot enter 
 you are to come and install yourself here 
 and this very day 
 or you will have to deal with cosette 
 she means to lead us all by the nose i warn you you have your own chamber here it is close to ours it opens on the garden the trouble with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is all ready you have only to take possession of it near your bed cosette has placed a huge old covered with utrecht velvet and she has said to it 
 stretch out your arms to him 
 a nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows every spring 
 in two months more you will have it you will have its nest on your left and ours on your right 
 by night it will sing and by day cosette will prattle 
 your chamber faces due south 
 cosette will arrange your books for you your voyages of captain cook and the and all your affairs i believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached i have fixed upon a corner of honor for that 
 you have conquered my grandfather you suit him 
 we will live together 
 do you play whist you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist 
 it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts you shall give her your arm you know as you used to in the luxembourg 
 we are absolutely resolved to be happy 
 and you shall be included in it in our happiness do you hear father 
 come will you breakfast with us 
 sir said jean valjean i have something to say to you i am an 
 the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear 
 these words i am an proceeding from the mouth of m fauchelevent and entering the ear of marius overshot the possible 
 it seemed to him that something had just been said to him but he did not know what he stood with his mouth wide open 
 then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not up to that moment observed the other terrible pallor 
 jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm unrolled the linen from around his hand bared his thumb and showed it to marius 
 there is nothing the matter with my hand said he 
 marius looked at the thumb 
 there has not been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean 
 there was in fact no trace of any injury 
 jean valjean continued 
 it was fitting that i should be absent from your marriage i absented myself as much as was in my power 
 so i invented this injury in order that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw into the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing 
 marius stammered 
 what is the meaning of this 
 the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that i have been in the galleys 
 you are driving me mad exclaimed marius in terror 
 monsieur pontmercy said jean valjean i was nineteen years in the galleys 
 for theft 
 then i was condemned for life for theft for a second offence 
 at the present moment i have broken my ban 
 in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist the evidence he was forced to give way 
 he began to understand and as always happens in such cases he understood too much an inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind 
 he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future 
 say all say all he cried 
 you are father 
 and he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror 
 jean valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling 
 it is necessary that you should believe me here sir although our oath to others may not be received in law 
 here he paused then with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority he added articulating slowly and emphasizing the syllables 
 you will believe me 
 i the father of cosette before god no monsieur le baron pontmercy i am a peasant of faverolles i earned my living by pruning trees 
 my name is not fauchelevent but jean valjean 
 i am not related to cosette 
 reassure yourself 
 marius stammered 
 who will prove that to me 
 i since i tell you so 
 marius looked at the man 
 he was melancholy yet tranquil 
 no lie could proceed from such a calm 
 that which is icy is sincere the truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb 
 i believe you said marius 
 jean valjean bent his head as though taking note of this and continued 
 what am i to cosette 
 a ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence 
 i love her it is true 
 one loves a child whom one has seen when very young being old oneself 
 when one is old one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children you may it seems to me suppose that i have something which resembles a heart 
 she was an orphan 
 without either father or mother she needed me 
 that is why i began to love her 
 children are so weak that the first comer even a man like me can become their protector 
 i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette i do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good action but if it be a good action well say that i have done it register this attenuating circumstance 
 cosette passes out of my life our two roads part 
 henceforth i can do nothing for her 
 she is madame pontmercy 
 her providence has changed and cosette gains by the change 
 all is well 
 as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not mention them to me but i forestall your thought they are a deposit 
 how did that deposit come into my hands 
 what does that matter 
 i restore the deposit nothing more can be demanded of me 
 i complete the restitution by announcing my true name 
 that concerns me 
 i have a reason for desiring that you should know who i am 
 and jean valjean looked marius full in the face 
 all that marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls 
 we have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed we say the first things that occur to us which are not always precisely those which should be said there are sudden revelations which one cannot bear and which intoxicate like baleful wine 
 marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal 
 but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this 
 who forces you to do so 
 you could have kept your secret to yourself you are neither denounced nor tracked nor pursued 
 you have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation 
 conclude 
 there is something more 
 in what connection do you make this confession what is your motive 
 my motive replied jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius from what motive in fact has this convict just said i am a convict well yes the motive is strange 
 it is out of honesty stay the unfortunate point is that i have a thread in my heart which keeps me fast 
 it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid 
 all life falls in ruin around one one resists 
 had i been able to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to go far away i should have been safe i had only to go away there are diligences in the rue bouloy you are happy i am going 
 i have tried to break that thread i have jerked at it it would not break i tore my heart with it then i said 
 i cannot live anywhere else than here 
 i must stay well yes you are right i am a fool why not simply remain here you offer me a chamber in this house madame pontmercy is sincerely attached to me she said to the stretch out your arms to him your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me i suit him we shall live together and take our meals in common i shall give cosette my arm madame pontmercy excuse me it is a habit we shall have but one roof one table one fire the same in winter the same promenade in summer that is joy that is happiness that is everything 
 we shall live as one family one family 
 at that word jean valjean became wild 
 he folded his arms glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones 
 as one family 
 no i belong to no family 
 i do not belong to yours i do not belong to any family of men 
 in houses where people are among themselves i am superfluous 
 there are families but there is nothing of the sort for me 
 i am an unlucky wretch i am left outside 
 did i have a father and mother 
 i almost doubt it on the day when i gave that child in marriage all came to an end i have seen her happy and that she is with a man whom she loves and that there exists here a kind old man a household of two angels and all joys in that house and that it was well i said to myself enter thou not 
 i could have lied it is true have deceived you all and remained monsieur fauchelevent 
 so long as it was for her i could lie but now it would be for myself and i must not 
 it was sufficient for me to hold my peace it is true and all would go on you ask me what has forced me to speak a very odd thing my conscience to hold my peace was very easy however 
 i passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it you questioned me and what i have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it well yes i have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself and i gave myself very good reasons i have done what i could but there are two things in which i have not succeeded in breaking the thread that holds me fixed riveted and sealed here by the heart or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when i am alone that is why i have come hither to tell you everything this morning everything or nearly everything 
 it is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself i keep that to myself 
 you know the essential points 
 so i have taken my mystery and have brought it to you 
 and i have disembowelled my secret before your eyes it was not a resolution that was easy to take 
 i struggled all night long 
 ah you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champmathieu affair that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury that the name of fauchelevent had been given to me by fauchelevent himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to him and that i might assuredly keep it and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me that i should not be in any way that i should be in my own little corner and that while you would have cosette i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her 
 each one of us would have had his share of happiness 
 if i continued to be monsieur fauchelevent that would arrange everything 
 yes with the exception of my soul there was joy everywhere upon my surface but the bottom of my soul remained black 
 it is not enough to be happy one must be content thus i should have remained monsieur fauchelevent thus i should have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your expansion i should have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full noonday i should have had shadows thus without crying ware i should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside i should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who i was you would drive me from it i should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who had they known would have said how horrible 
 i should have touched you with my elbow which you have a right to dislike i should have filched your clasps of the hand 
 there would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself a stranger would have been present i should have been side by side with you in your existence having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit thus i a dead man should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings 
 i should have condemned her to myself forever you and cosette and i would have had all three of our heads in the green cap 
 does it not make you shudder 
 i am only the most crushed of men i should have been the most monstrous of men and i should have committed that crime every day 
 and i should have had that face of night upon my visage every day every day and i should have communicated to you a share in my taint every day every day to you my dearly beloved my children to you my innocent creatures 
 is it nothing to hold peace is it a simple matter to keep silence 
 no it is not simple 
 there is a silence which lies 
 and my lie and my fraud and my indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime i should have drained drop by drop i should have spit it out then swallowed it again i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday and my good morning would have lied and my good night would have lied and i should have slept on it i should have eaten it with my bread and i should have looked cosette in the face and i should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul and i should have been an abominable villain why should i do it in order to be happy 
 in order to be happy have i the right to be happy 
 i stand outside of life sir 
 jean valjean paused 
 marius listened 
 such chains of ideas and of anguishes cannot be interrupted 
 jean valjean lowered his voice once more but it was no longer a dull was a sinister voice 
 you ask why i speak

 it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it well conscience is another grasp 
 if one desires to be happy sir one must never understand duty for as soon as one has comprehended it it is implacable 
 one would say that it punished you for comprehending it but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel god beside you

 second epilogue 
 chapter iv 
 
 having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that will to the deity history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed power 
 a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power 
 napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he ordered was done 
 this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others 
 it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one a domination based on the application or threat of physical force like the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled over millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over 
 if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked for elsewhere in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power 
 and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange understanding of power for true gold 
 power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed or tacit consent to their chosen rulers 
 in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation 
 the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire namely as something existing absolutely but for history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon 
 from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power existing immutably outside time is but to questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing 
 if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if not then why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom he arrested 
 do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take part transfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international relations is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians 
 to these questions three answers are possible 
 either to assume that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen and that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power or that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance of several authorities their struggles and their falls result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others 
 and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers 
 some historians those biographical and specialist historians already referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence 
 their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children 
 recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually contradict one another 
 each historian according to his view of what constitutes a progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people to this question historians reply that louis activity contrary to the program reacted on louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers of the will from from one individual to another especially in view of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the will but are accidents dependent on cunning on mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a party leader so that the greater part of the events of history civil wars revolutions and conquests are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the will but as results of the will of one or more individuals that is once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory 
 these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory 
 historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them 
 but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have those leaders 
 the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people 
 but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the will or only some part of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the will as some historians suppose then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the life as other philosophical historians believe then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the life we have first of all to know in what the life consists 
 met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice agriculture or slay their fellow creatures 
 history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais and others 
 is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski 
 is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the and their ladies for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown 
 still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples 
 the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another 
 if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not the history of the life of the peoples

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter i 
 
 and with a poignant accent he added 
 monsieur pontmercy this is not common sense i am an honest man it is by degrading myself in your eyes that i elevate myself in my own this has happened to me once before but it was less painful then it was a mere nothing 
 yes an honest man 
 i should not be so if through my fault you had continued to esteem me now that you despise me i am so 
 i have that fatality hanging over me that not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration that consideration humiliates me and crushes me inwardly and in order that i may respect myself it is necessary that i should be despised 
 then i straighten up again 
 i am a who obeys his conscience 
 i know well that that is most improbable but what would you have me do about it it is the fact 
 i have entered into engagements with myself i keep them 
 there are encounters which bind us there are chances which involve us in duties you see monsieur pontmercy various things have happened to me in the course of my life 
 again jean valjean paused swallowing his saliva with an effort as though his words had a bitter and then he went on 
 when one has such a horror hanging over one one has not the right to make others share it without their knowledge one has not the right to make them slip over own precipice without their perceiving it one has not the right to let red blouse drag upon them one has no right to slyly encumber with misery the happiness of others 
 it is hideous to approach those who are healthy and to touch them in the dark with ulcer 
 in spite of the fact that fauchelevent lent me his name i have no right to use it he could give it to me but i could not take it 
 a name is an i you see sir that i have thought somewhat i have read a little although i am a peasant and you see that i express myself properly i understand things 
 i have procured myself an education 
 well yes to abstract a name and to place oneself under it is dishonest letters of the alphabet can be filched like a purse or a watch to be a false signature in flesh and blood to be a living false key to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock never more to look straightforward to forever eye askance to be infamous within the i no no no no no 
 it is better to suffer to bleed to weep to tear skin from the flesh with nails to pass nights writhing in anguish to devour oneself body and soul 
 that is why i have just told you all this wantonly as you say 
 he drew a painful breath and hurled this final word 
 in days gone by i stole a loaf of bread in order to live in order to live i will not steal a name 
 to live interrupted marius 
 you do not need that name in order to live 
 ah 
 i understand the matter said jean valjean raising and lowering his head several times in succession 
 a silence ensued 
 both held their peace each plunged in a gulf of thoughts 
 marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his mouth on one of his fingers which was folded back jean valjean was pacing to and fro 
 he paused before a mirror and remained motionless 
 then as though replying to some inward course of reasoning he said as he gazed at the mirror which he did not see 
 while at present i am relieved 
 he took up his march again and walked to the other end of the at the moment when he turned round he perceived that marius was watching his walk 
 then he said with an inexpressible intonation 
 i drag my leg a little 
 now you understand why 
 then he turned fully round towards marius 
 and now sir imagine this 
 i have said nothing i have remained monsieur fauchelevent i have taken my place in your house i am one of you i am in my chamber i come to breakfast in the morning in slippers in the evening all three of us go to the play i accompany madame pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale we are together you think me your equal one fine day you are there and i am there we are conversing we are laughing all at once you hear a voice shouting this name 
 jean valjean and behold that terrible hand the police darts from the darkness and abruptly tears off my mask 
 again he paused marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder jean valjean resumed 
 what do you say to that 
 marius silence answered for him 
 jean valjean continued 
 you see that i am right in not holding my peace 
 be happy be in heaven be the angel of an angel exist in the sun be content therewith and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth you have before you sir a wretched man 
 marius slowly crossed the room and when he was quite close to jean valjean he offered the latter his hand 
 but marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not offered jean valjean let him have his own way and it seemed to marius that he pressed a hand of marble 
 my grandfather has friends said marius i will procure your pardon 
 it is useless replied jean valjean 
 i am believed to be dead and that suffices 
 the dead are not subjected to surveillance they are supposed to rot in peace 
 death is the same thing as pardon 
 and disengaging the hand which marius held he added with a sort of inexorable dignity 
 moreover the friend to whom i have recourse is the doing of my duty and i need but one pardon that of my conscience 
 at that moment a door at the other end of the opened gently half way and in the opening head appeared they saw only her sweet face her hair was in charming disorder her eyelids were still swollen with sleep 
 she made the movement of a bird which thrusts its head out of its nest glanced first at her husband then at jean valjean and cried to them with a smile so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose 
 i will wager that you are talking politics 
 how stupid that is instead of being with me 
 jean valjean shuddered 
 cosette stammered marius 
 and he paused 
 one would have said that they were two criminals 
 cosette who was radiant continued to gaze at both of them there was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise 
 i have caught you in the very act said cosette 
 just now i heard my father fauchelevent through the door saying 
 conscience doing my duty that is politics indeed it is 
 i will not have it 
 people should not talk politics the very next day it is not right 
 you are mistaken 
 cosette said marius we are talking business we are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs 
 that is not it at all interrupted cosette 
 i am coming does any body want me here 
 and passing resolutely through the door she entered the she was dressed in a voluminous white with a thousand folds and large sleeves which starting from the neck fell to her feet 
 in the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels 
 she contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror then exclaimed in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy 
 there was once a king and a queen 
 oh how happy i am 
 that said she made a curtsey to marius and to jean valjean 
 there said she i am going to install myself near you in an we breakfast in half an hour you shall say anything you like i know well that men must talk and i will be very good 
 marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her 
 we are talking business 
 by the way said cosette i have opened my window a flock of pierrots has arrived in the not maskers is but not for the birds 
 i tell you that we are talking business go my little cosette leave us alone for a moment 
 we are talking figures 
 that will bore you 
 you have a charming cravat on this morning marius 
 you are very dandified monseigneur 
 no it will not bore me 
 i assure you that it will bore you 
 no since it is you 
 i shall not understand you but i shall listen to you 
 when one hears the voices of those whom one loves one does not need to understand the words that they utter that we should be here is all that i desire i shall remain with you bah 
 you are my beloved cosette 
 impossible 
 impossible 
 yes 
 very good said cosette 
 i was going to tell you some news i could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep that your aunt is at mass that the chimney in my father room smokes that nicolette has sent for the that toussaint and nicolette have already quarrelled that nicolette makes sport of stammer 
 well you shall know nothing ah it is impossible you shall see gentlemen that i in my turn can say 
 it is impossible 
 then who will be caught 
 i beseech you my little marius let me stay here with you two 
 i swear to you that it is indispensable that we should be alone 
 well am i anybody 
 jean valjean had not uttered a single word 
 cosette turned to him 
 in the first place father i want you to come and embrace me what do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part who gave me such a father as that 
 you must perceive that my family life is very unhappy 
 my husband beats me 
 come embrace me instantly 
 jean valjean approached 
 cosette turned toward marius 
 as for you i shall make a face at you 
 then she presented her brow to jean valjean 
 jean valjean advanced a step toward her 
 cosette recoiled 
 father you are pale 
 does your arm hurt you 
 it is well said jean valjean 
 did you sleep badly 
 no 
 are you sad 
 no 
 embrace me if you are well if you sleep well if you are content i will not scold you 
 and again she offered him her brow 
 jean valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial gleam 
 smile 
 jean valjean obeyed 
 it was the smile of a spectre 
 now defend me against my husband 
 cosette ejaculated marius 
 get angry father 
 say that i must stay 
 you can certainly talk before me 
 so you think me very silly 
 what you say is astonishing business placing money in a bank a great matter truly men make mysteries out of nothing 
 i am very pretty this morning look at me marius 
 and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders and an indescribably exquisite pout she glanced at marius 
 i love you said marius 
 i adore you said cosette 
 and they fell irresistibly into each arms 
 now said cosette adjusting a fold of her with a triumphant little grimace i shall stay 
 no not that said marius in a supplicating tone 
 we have to finish something 
 still no 
 marius assumed a grave tone 
 i assure you cosette that it is impossible 
 ah you put on your voice sir 
 that is well i go you father have not upheld me 
 monsieur my father monsieur my husband you are tyrants 
 i shall go and tell grandpapa if you think that i am going to return and talk platitudes to you you are mistaken 
 i am proud 
 i shall wait for you now you shall see that it is you who are going to be bored without me i am going it is well 
 and she left the room 
 two seconds later the door opened once more her fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to them 
 i am very angry indeed 
 the door closed again and the shadows descended once more 
 it was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night without itself being conscious of it 
 marius made sure that the door was securely closed 
 poor cosette he murmured when she finds out 
 at that word jean valjean trembled in every limb 
 he fixed on marius a bewildered eye 
 cosette oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this that is right 
 stay i had not thought of that 
 one has the strength for one thing but not for another 
 sir i conjure you i entreat now sir give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her 
 is it not enough that you should know it i have been able to say it myself without being forced to it i could have told it to the universe to the whole was all one to me 
 but she she does not know what it is it would terrify her 
 what a convict we should be obliged to explain matters to her to say to her 
 he is a man who has been in the galleys she saw the pass by one day 
 oh 
 my god he dropped into an and hid his face in his hands 
 his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping 
 silent tears terrible tears 
 there is something of suffocation in the sob 
 he was seized with a sort of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmur so low that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths 
 oh would that i could die 
 be at your ease said marius i will keep your secret for myself alone 
 x and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but forced for the last hour to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes upon m fauchelevent overcome little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself marius added 
 it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted that is an act of probity 
 it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you 
 fix the sum yourself it shall be counted out to you do not fear to set it very high 
 i thank you sir replied jean valjean gently 
 he remained in thought for a moment mechanically passing the tip of his across his then he lifted up his voice 
 all is nearly over 
 but one last thing remains for me 
 what is it 
 jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation and without voice without breath he stammered rather than said 
 now that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosette any more 
 i think that would be better replied marius coldly 
 i shall never see her more murmured jean valjean 
 and he directed his steps towards the door 
 he laid his hand on the knob the latch yielded the door opened jean valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for a second then closed the door again and turned to marius 
 he was no longer pale he was livid 
 there were no longer any tears in his eyes but only a sort of tragic flame 
 his voice had regained a strange composure 
 stay sir he said 
 if you will allow it i will come to see her i assure you that i desire it greatly 
 if i had not cared to see cosette i should not have made to you the confession that i have made i should have gone away but as i desired to remain in the place where cosette is and to continue to see her i had to tell you about it honestly 
 you follow my reasoning do you not it is a matter easily understood 
 you see i have had her with me for more than nine years 
 we lived first in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the luxembourg that was where you saw her for the first time 
 you remember her blue plush hat 
 then we went to the quartier des invalides where there was a railing on a garden the rue plumet 
 i lived in a little back whence i could hear her piano that was my life 
 we never left each other 
 that lasted for nine years and some months 
 i was like her own father and she was my child 
 i do not know whether you understand monsieur pontmercy but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anything would be hard 
 if you do not disapprove of it i will come to see cosette from time to time i will not come often 
 i will not remain long 
 you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little on the ground floor 
 i could enter perfectly well by the back door but that might create surprise perhaps and it would be better i think for me to enter by the usual door 
 truly sir i should like to see a little more of cosette 
 as rarely as you please put yourself in my place i have nothing left but that 
 and then we must be cautious 
 if i no longer come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be considered singular 
 what i can do by the way is to come in the afternoon when night is beginning to fall 
 you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be waiting for you 
 you are kind sir said jean valjean 
 marius saluted jean valjean happiness escorted despair to the door and these two men parted

 second epilogue 
 chapter v 
 
 the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history 
 the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as soon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occur that is as soon as history begins that theory explains nothing 
 the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the will cannot be verified for it never occurred 
 whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him 
 the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head 
 the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader this is what historians of the first class say those who assume the unconditional transference of the will 
 if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known with this method of observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the direction he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to the change of direction are no longer in front but on one side or even in the rear 
 if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of their age 
 the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other words 
 what causes historical events power what is power power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people that is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand 
 if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man has besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies his reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon 
 not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events 
 whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will the event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it 
 the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience 
 on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a will his words are only part of the general activity expressed in an event as for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming an incomprehensible supernatural force a miracle one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men on the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to say their commands are often not executed and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs 
 without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard power as the cause of events 
 power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that exists between the expression of will and the execution of that will by others 
 to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to the deity 
 if the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient history tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore the condition of all that takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands and the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command

 book last draught from the cup 
 chapter ii 
 
 the obscurities which a revelation can contain 
 marius was quite upset 
 the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen cosette was now explained to him there was something enigmatic about that person of which his instinct had warned him 
 this enigma was the most hideous of disgraces the galleys this m fauchelevent was the convict jean valjean 
 to abruptly find such a secret in the midst of happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves 
 was the happiness of marius and cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood 
 was this an accomplished fact 
 did the acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage now consummated was there nothing to be done 
 had marius wedded the convict as well 
 in vain may one be crowned with light and joy in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life happy love such shocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy even the demigod in his glory to shudder 
 as is always the case in changes of view of this nature marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself had he been wanting in divination 
 had he been wanting in prudence had he involuntarily dulled his wits 
 a little perhaps 
 had he entered upon this love affair which had ended in his marriage to cosette without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings 
 he is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves that life amends us little by admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes and invades the entire man to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist 
 we have more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius individuality 
 he recalled that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plumet during those six or seven ecstatic weeks he had not even spoke to cosette of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight 
 how had it happened that he had not mentioned this to cosette 
 yet it was so near and so terrible how had it come to pass that he had not even named the thenardiers and particularly on the day when he had encountered eponine he now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time nevertheless he could account for it 
 he recalled his benumbed state his intoxication with cosette love absorbing everything that catching away of each other into the ideal and perhaps also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul a vague dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any part his agency in which he had kept secret and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser 
 moreover these few weeks had been a flash of lightning there had been no time for anything except love 
 in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had told cosette about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discovered that jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius would that have changed her cosette 
 would he have drawn back would he have adored her any the less 
 would he have refrained from marrying her 
 no then there was nothing to regret nothing with which he need reproach himself 
 all was well there is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers marius blind had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight 
 love had bandaged his eyes in order to lead him whither 
 to paradise 
 but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment 
 marius ancient estrangement towards this man towards this fauchelevent who had turned into jean valjean was at present mingled with horror 
 in this horror let us state there was some pity and even a certain surprise 
 this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that deposit 
 and what a deposit 
 six hundred thousand francs 
 he alone was in the secret of that deposit 
 he might have kept it all he had restored it all 
 moreover he had himself revealed his situation 
 nothing forced him to this 
 if any one learned who he was it was through himself in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation there was acceptance of peril 
 for a condemned man a mask is not a mask it is a shelter 
 a false name is security and he had rejected that false name 
 he the might have hidden himself forever in an honest family he had withstood this temptation and with what motive 
 through a conscientious scruple he himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth in short whatever this jean valjean might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening 
 there existed some mysterious which had begun and to all appearances scruples had for a long time already controlled this man 
 such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul 
 jean valjean was sincere 
 this sincerity visible palpable irrefragable evident from the very grief that it caused him rendered inquiries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had said 
 here for marius there was a strange reversal of situations what breathed from m fauchelevent distrust 
 what did jean valjean inspire confidence 
 in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck he admitted the active principle he admitted the passive principle and he tried to reach a balance 
 but all this went on as in a storm 
 marius while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean so to speak in the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist 
 the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession these were good 
 this produced a lightening of the cloud then the cloud became black once more 
 troubled as were marius memories a shadow of them returned to him 
 after all what was that adventure in the jondrette attic why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a complaint 
 here marius found the answer 
 because that man was a fugitive from justice who had broken his ban 
 another question 
 why had that man come to the barricade 
 for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat 
 this man had been in the barricade he had not fought there 
 what had he come there for 
 in the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied 
 javert 
 marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean dragging the pinioned javert out of the barricade and he still heard behind the corner of the little rue mondetour that frightful pistol shot 
 obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the the one was in the way 
 jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself he had arrived late 
 he probably knew that javert was a prisoner there the corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal who is in the path of repentance may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance 
 jean valjean had killed javert 
 at least that seemed to be evident 
 this was the final question to be sure but to this there was no reply 
 this question marius felt like pincers 
 how had it come to pass that jean existence had elbowed that of cosette for so long a period 
 what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man 
 are there then chains for two which are forged on high and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon 
 so a crime and an innocence can be in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness in that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny can two brows pass side by side the one ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off 
 in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal 
 who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more incomprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb for the wolf loved the lamb for the fierce creature adored the feeble one for during the space of nine years the angel had had the monster as her point of support 
 childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight her virginal growth towards life and light had been sheltered by that hideous devotion here questions exfoliated so to speak into innumerable enigmas abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy 
 what was this 
 the old symbols of genesis are eternal in human society such as it now exists and until a broader day shall effect a change in it there will always be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one which is according to good is abel the other which is according to evil is cain 
 what was this tender cain 
 what was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin watching over her rearing her guarding her dignifying her and enveloping her impure as he was himself with purity 
 what was that which had venerated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot 
 what was this jean valjean educating cosette 
 what was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud 
 that was jean secret that was also secret 
 in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled 
 the one in some sort reassured him as to the other 
 god was as visible in this affair as was jean valjean 
 god has his instruments he makes use of the tool which he wills 
 he is not responsible to men 
 do we know how god sets about the work 
 jean valjean had labored over cosette 
 he had to some extent made that soul that was incontestable 
 well what then 
 the workman was horrible but the work was admirable 
 god produces his miracles as seems good to him 
 he had constructed that charming cosette and he had employed jean valjean 
 it had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for himself 
 what account have we to demand of him is this the first time that the has aided the spring to create the rose 
 marius made himself these replies and declared to himself that they were good 
 he had not dared to press jean valjean on all the points which we have just indicated but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it 
 he adored cosette he possessed cosette cosette was splendidly pure 
 that was sufficient for him what enlightenment did he need 
 cosette was a light 
 does light require enlightenment 
 he had everything what more could he desire 
 all is not that enough 
 jean personal affairs did not concern him 
 and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convulsively to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch i am nothing to cosette 
 ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence 
 jean valjean was a he had said so himself well he had passed 
 whatever he was his part was finished 
 henceforth there remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to cosette 
 cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her lover her husband her celestial male 
 cosette as she took her flight winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis jean valjean 
 in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved he always returned to a certain horror for jean valjean 
 a sacred horror perhaps for as we have just pointed out he felt a quid divinum in that man but do what he would and seek what extenuation he would he was certainly forced to fall back upon this 
 the man was a convict that is to say a being who has not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the very lowest rung 
 after the very last of men comes the convict 
 the convict is no longer so to speak in the semblance of the living 
 the law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man 
 marius on penal questions still held to the inexorable system though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes 
 he had not yet accomplished all progress we admit 
 he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right 
 he had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable he was not shocked by the word vindicte 
 he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering and he accepted as the process of civilization social damnation 
 he still stood at this point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was good and at bottom wholly formed of latent progress 
 in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive 
 he was a man reproved he was the convict that word was for him like the sound of the trump on the day of judgment and after having reflected upon jean valjean for a long time his final gesture had been to turn away his head vade retro 
 marius if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact while interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said 
 you are confessing me had not nevertheless put to him two or three decisive questions 
 it was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind but that he had been afraid of them 
 the jondrette attic the barricade 
 javert 
 who knows where these revelations would have stopped 
 jean valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back and who knows whether marius after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him back 
 has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjunctures to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have asked a question 
 it is especially when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice 
 it is not wise to question sinister situations to the last point particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with them 
 what a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of jean valjean and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as cosette 
 who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel the spattering of a is of the thunder also fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association 
 rightly or wrongly marius had been afraid he already knew too much 
 he sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light 
 in dismay he bore off cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean 
 that man was the night the living and horrible night how should he dare to seek the bottom of it 
 it is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow 
 who knows what its reply will be the dawn may be blackened forever by it 
 in this state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to marius 
 he now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable questions before which he had recoiled and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung he felt that he was too good too gentle too weak if we must say the word 
 this weakness had led him to an imprudent concession he had allowed himself to be touched 
 he had been in the wrong he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean 
 jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he should have done and have freed his house from that man 
 he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened blinded and carried him away he was displeased with himself 
 what was he to do now 
 jean visits were profoundly repugnant to him 
 what was the use in having that man in his house 
 what did the man want 
 here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself he had promised he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean valjean held his promise one must keep word even to a convict above all to a convict 
 still his first duty was to cosette in short he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him 
 marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing from one to the other and moved by all of them hence arose a profound trouble 
 it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a talent and marius succeeded in doing it 
 however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that a man can be towards cosette all that marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real that sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily

 second epilogue 
 chapter vi 
 
 only the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries and only the deity independent of everything can by his sole will determine the direction of movement but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs 
 reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible 
 no command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole series of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event 
 when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet the commissariat and so on and so on millions of commands which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia 
 if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly expressed this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case but did so correspond in the latter 
 for an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible not only in the case of invasion of russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and are executed 
 our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be apart from that the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events such for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will 
 we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality in all activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions of his will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series of unexecuted orders of one series for the campaign of was carried out not because those orders differed in any way from the other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil 
 so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we find that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two 
 to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the deity but from a man which is that the man who gives the command himself takes part in 
 this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power this relation consists in the following 
 for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the relation between those taking part in it is always the same 
 men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the smaller number a less direct share in the collective action for which they have combined 
 of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army 
 every army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank and file of whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher military rank corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer and of officers of whom there are still fewer and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person 
 a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which will represent the commander in chief 
 the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of the cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions from men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer still less often acts directly himself but commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity in agriculture trade and every administration 
 and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest we see a law by which men to take associated action combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are while the less their direct participation in the action itself the more they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding 
 this relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power 
 having restored the condition of time under which all events occur find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding

 of prophecies 
 i mean not to speak of divine prophecies nor of heathen oracles nor of natural 
 predictions but only of prophecies that have been of certain memory and from hidden causes saith the pythonissa to saul tomorrow thou and thy son shall be with me homer hath these verses at domus aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis a prophecy as it seems of the roman empire seneca the tragedian hath these verses venient annis secula seris quibus oceanus vincula rerum laxet et ingens pateat tellus tiphysque novos detegat orbes nec sit terris ultima thule a prophecy of the discovery of america the daughter of polycrates dreamed that jupiter bathed her father and apollo anointed him and it came to pass that he was crucified in an open place where the sun made his body run with sweat and the rain washed it philip of macedon dreamed he sealed up his belly whereby he did expound it that his wife should be barren but aristander the soothsayer told him his wife was with child because men do not use to seal vessels that are empty 
 a phantasm that appeared to m brutus in his tent said to him philippis iterum me 
 videbis tiberius said to galba tu quoque galba degustabis imperium in 
 time there went a prophecy in the east that those that should come forth of judea should reign over the world which though it may be was meant of our saviour yet tacitus expounds it of vespasian domidan dreamed the night before he was slain that a golden head was growing out of the nape of his neck and indeed the succession that followed him for many years made golden times henry the sixth of england said of henry the seventh when he was a lad and gave him water 
 this is the lad that shall enjoy the crown for which we strive when i was in france i heard from one dr pena that the queen mother who was given to curious arts caused the king her nativity to be calculated under a false name and the astrologer gave a judgement that he should be killed in a duel at which the queen laughed thinking her husband to be above challenges and duels but he was slain upon a course at tilt the splinters of the staff of mongomery going in at his beaver the trivial prophecy which i heard when i was a child and queen elizabeth was in the flower of her years was when hempe is spun done whereby it was generally conceived that after the princes had reigned which had the principal letters of that word hempe which were henry edward mary philip and elizabeth england should come to utter confusion which thanks be to god is verified only in the change of the name for that the style is now no more of england but of britain there was also another prophecy before the year of which i do not well understand 
 
 there shall be seen upon a day between the baugh and the may the black fleet of norway when that that is come and gone england build houses of lime and stone for after wars shall you have none 
 
 it was generally conceived to be meant of the spanish fleet that came in for 
 that the king of surname as they say is norway the prediction of 
 regiomontanus octogesimus octavus marabilis annus was thought likewise accomplished in the sending of that great fleet being the greatest in strength though not in number of all that ever swam upon the sea 
 as for dream i think it was a jest it was that he was devoured of a long dragon and it was expounded of a maker of sausages that troubled him exceedingly there are numbers of the like kind especially if you include dreams and predictions of astrology but i have set down these few only of certain credit for example my judgement is that they ought all to be despised and ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside though when i say despised i mean it as for belief for otherwise the spreading or publishing of them is in no sort to be despised for they have done much mischief and i see many severe laws made to suppress them 
 that that hath given them grace and some credit consisteth in three things first that men mark when they hit and never mark when they miss as they do generally also of dreams the second is that probable conjectures or obscure traditions many times turn themselves into prophecies while the nature of man which coveteth divination thinks it no peril to foretell that which indeed they do but collect as that of verse for so much was then subject to demonstration that the globe of the earth had great parts beyond the atlantic which mought be probably conceived not to be all sea and adding thereto the tradition in timaeus and his atlanticus it mought encourage one to turn it to a prediction the third and last which is the great one is that almost all of them being infinite in number have been impostures and by idle and crafty brains merely contrived and feigned after the event past

 chapter vii 
 
 the wisdom of tholomyes 
 in the meantime while some sang the rest talked together tumultuously all at once it was no longer anything but intervened 
 let us not talk at random nor too fast he us reflect if we wish to be brilliant 
 too much improvisation empties the mind in a stupid way 
 running beer gathers no haste gentlemen 
 let us mingle majesty with the feast 
 let us eat with meditation let us make haste slowly 
 let us not the springtime if it makes haste it is done for that is to say it gets frozen 
 excess of zeal ruins and excess of zeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners 
 no zeal gentlemen 
 grimod de la reyniere agrees with talleyrand 
 a hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group 
 leave us in peace tholomyes said blachevelle 
 down with the tyrant said fameuil 
 bombarda bombance and bambochel cried listolier 
 sunday exists resumed fameuil 
 we are sober added listolier 
 tholomyes remarked blachevelle contemplate my calmness mon calme 
 you are the marquis of that retorted tholomyes 
 this mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a marquis de montcalm was at that time a celebrated the frogs held their peace 
 friends cried tholomyes with the accent of a man who had recovered his empire come to yourselves 
 this pun which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much which falls in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect 
 the pun is the dung of the mind which jest falls no matter where and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths 
 a whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring be it from me to insult the pun 
 i honor it in proportion to its merits nothing more 
 all the most august the most sublime the most charming of humanity and perhaps outside of humanity have made puns 
 jesus christ made a pun on st peter moses on isaac aeschylus on polynices cleopatra on octavius 
 and observe that pun preceded the battle of actium and that had it not been for it no one would have remembered the city of toryne a greek name which signifies a ladle 
 that once conceded i return to my exhortation 
 i repeat brothers i repeat no zeal no hubbub no excess even in witticisms gayety jollities or plays on to me 
 i have the prudence of amphiaraus and the baldness of caesar 
 there must be a limit even to rebuses 
 est modus in rebus 
 there must be a limit even to dinners 
 you are fond of apple turnovers ladies do not indulge in them to in the matter of turnovers good sense and art are chastises the glutton gula punit gulax 
 indigestion is charged by the good god with preaching morality to remember this 
 each one of our passions even love has a stomach which must not be filled too full 
 in all things the word finis must be written in good season must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent the bolt must be drawn on appetite one must set own fantasy to the violin and carry self to the post 
 the sage is the man who knows how at a given moment to effect his own arrest 
 have some confidence in me for i have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law according to the verdict of my examinations for i know the difference between the question put and the question pending for i have sustained a thesis in latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at rome at the epoch when munatius demens was quaestor of the parricide because i am going to be a doctor apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely necessary that i should be an recommend you to moderation in your desires 
 it is true that my name is felix tholomyes i speak well 
 happy is he who when the hour strikes takes a heroic resolve and abdicates like sylla or origenes 
 favourite listened with profound attention 
 felix said she what a pretty word 
 i love that is latin it means prosper 
 tholomyes went on 
 quirites gentlemen caballeros my friends 
 do you wish never to feel the prick to do without the nuptial bed and to brave more simple 
 here is the receipt 
 lemonade excessive exercise hard labor work yourself to death drag blocks sleep not hold vigil gorge yourself with nitrous beverages and potions of nymphaeas drink emulsions of poppies and agnus castus season this with a strict diet starve yourself and add thereto cold baths girdles of herbs the application of a plate of lead lotions made with the subacetate of lead and fomentations of oxycrat 
 i prefer a woman said listolier 
 woman resumed tholomyes distrust her 
 woe to him who yields himself to the unstable heart of woman 
 woman is perfidious and disingenuous 
 she detests the serpent from professional serpent is the shop over the way 
 tholomyes cried blachevelle you are drunk 
 pardieu said tholomyes 
 then be gay resumed blachevelle 
 i agree to that responded tholomyes 
 and refilling his glass he rose 
 glory to wine 
 nunc te bacche canam 
 pardon me ladies that is spanish 
 and the proof of it senoras is this 
 like people like cask 
 the arrobe of castile contains sixteen litres the cantaro of alicante twelve the almude of the canaries the cuartin of the balearic isles the boot of tzar peter thirty 
 long live that tzar who was great and long live his boot which was still greater 
 ladies take the advice of a friend make a mistake in your neighbor if you see property of love is to err 
 a love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an english who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing 
 it is not made for that it errs gayly our gentle love 
 it has been said error is human i say error is love 
 ladies i idolize you all 
 o zephine o josephine face more than irregular you would be charming were you not all askew 
 you have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has sat down by mistake 
 as for favourite o nymphs and muses one day when blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the rue he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up which displayed her legs 
 this prologue pleased him and blachevelle fell in love 
 the one he loved was favourite 
 o favourite thou hast ionian lips 
 there was a greek painter named euphorion who was surnamed the painter of the lips 
 that greek alone would have been worthy to paint thy mouth 
 listen before thee there was never a creature worthy of the name 
 thou wert made to receive the apple like venus or to eat it like eve beauty begins with have just referred to eve it is thou who hast created deservest the of the beautiful woman 
 o favourite i cease to address you as thou because i pass from poetry to were speaking of my name a little while ago 
 that touched me but let us whoever we may be distrust names 
 they may delude am called felix and i am not happy 
 words are liars 
 let us not blindly accept the indications which they afford us 
 it would be a mistake to write to liege for corks and to pau for dahlia were i in your place i would call myself flower should smell sweet and woman should have wit 
 i say nothing of fantine she is a dreamer a musing thoughtful pensive person she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun who has strayed into the life of a grisette but who takes refuge in illusions and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing and who with her eyes fixed on heaven wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in existence 
 o fantine know tholomyes i am all illusion but she does not even hear me that blond maid of chimeras as for the rest everything about her is freshness suavity youth sweet morning light 
 o fantine maid worthy of being called marguerite or pearl you are a woman from the beauteous orient 
 ladies a second piece of not marry marriage is a graft it takes well or ill avoid that risk 
 but bah what am i saying 
 i am wasting my are incurable on the subject of marriage and all that we wise men can say will not prevent the and the from dreaming of husbands studded with so be it but my beauties remember this you eat too much have but one fault o woman and that is nibbling nibbling sex your pretty little white teeth adore heed me well sugar is a salt 
 all salts are is the most desiccating of all salts it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins hence the coagulation and then the solidification of the blood hence tubercles in the lungs hence is why diabetes borders on consumption 
 then do not crunch sugar and you will live 
 i turn to the men 
 gentlemen make conquest rob each other of your without remorse 
 chassez love there are no friends 
 everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open 
 no quarter war to the death a pretty woman is a casus belli a pretty woman is flagrant the invasions of history have been determined by is right 
 romulus carried off the sabines william carried off the saxon women caesar carried off the roman women 
 the man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men and for my own part to all those unfortunate men who are widowers i throw the sublime proclamation of bonaparte to the army of you are in need of everything the enemy has it 
 liege 
 a pau 
 a jest on peau skin 
 tholomyes paused 
 take breath tholomyes said blachevelle 
 at the same moment blachevelle supported by listolier and fameuil struck up to a plaintive air one of those studio songs composed of the first words which come to hand rhymed richly and not at all as destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind which have their birth in the vapor of pipes and are dissipated and take their flight with them 
 this is the couplet by which the group replied to tholomyes harangue the father so grave some money to an agent gave that master good might be made pope on saint johns day fair but this good clermont could not be made pope because no priest was he and then their agent whose wrath burned with all their money back returned 
 this was not calculated to calm tholomyes improvisation he emptied his glass filled refilled it and began again 
 down with wisdom 
 forget all that i have said 
 let us be neither prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes 
 i propose a toast to mirth be merry 
 let us complete our course of law by folly and and the digest 
 let justinian be the male and feasting the female 
 joy in the depths 
 live o creation 
 the world is a great diamond 
 i am happy 
 the birds are a festival everywhere 
 the nightingale is a gratuitous i salute thee 
 o luxembourg 
 o georgics of the rue madame and of the allee de o pensive infantry all those charming nurses who while they guard the children amuse themselves 
 the pampas of america would please me if i had not the arcades of the odeon 
 my soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas 
 all is beautiful 
 the flies buzz in the sun has sneezed out the humming bird 
 embrace me fantine

 return of the jedi 
 vi 
 
 the starry sky seemed very near the treetops to luke as he and his friends werecarried into the ewok village he even aware it was a village at orange sparks of light in the distance he thought initially to be stars this wasparticularly true on his back strapped to the pole as he bright points flickered directly above him between the trees 
 but then he found himself being hoisted up intricate stairways and hidden rampsaround the immense trunks and gradually the higher they went the bigger andcracklier the lights became when the group was hundreds of feet up in the finally realized the lights were the treetops 
 they were finally taken out onto a rickety wooden walkway far too far off theground to be able to see anything below them but the abysmal drop for one bleakmoment luke was afraid they were simply going to be pitched over the brink to testtheir knowledge of forest lore but the ewoks had something else in mind 
 the narrow platform ended midway between two trees the first creature inline grabbed hold of a long vine and swung across to the far luke couldsee by twisting his head around had a large cavelike opening carved into its titanicsurface vines were quickly tossed back and forth across the chasm until soon akind of lattice was luke found himself being pulled across it on hisback still tied to the wooden poles he looked down once into nothingness itwas an unwelcome sensation 
 on the other side they rested on a shaky narrow platform until everyone wasacross then the diminutive dismantled the webbing of vines andproceeded into the tree with their captives it was totally black inside but luke hadthe impression it was more of a tunnel through the wood than an actual cavern theimpression of dense solid walls was everywhere like a burrow in a they emerged fifty yards beyond they were in the village square 
 it was a series of wooden platforms planks and walkways connecting anextensive cluster of enormous trees supported by this scaffolding was a village ofhuts constructed of an odd combination of stiffened leather daub and wattle thatchedroofs mud floors small campfires burned before many of the sparkswere caught by an elaborate system of hanging vines which funneled them to asmothering point and everywhere were hundreds of ewoks 
 cooks tanners guards grandfathers mother ewoks gathered up squealingbabies at the sight of the prisoners and scurried into their huts or pointed or smoke filled the air children played games minstrels played strange resonantmusic on hollow logs windy reeds 
 there was vast blackness below vaster still above but here in this tiny villagesuspended between the two luke felt warmth and light and special peace 
 the entourage of captors and captives stopped before the largest hut and artoo were leaned on their poles against a nearby tree han was tiedto a spit and balanced above a pile of kindling that looked suspiciously like abarbecue pit dozens of ewoks gathered around chattering curiously in animatedsqueals 
 teebo emerged from the large structure he was slightly bigger than most ofthe others and undeniably fiercer his fur was a pattern of light and dark graystripes instead of the usual leathery hood he wore a horned animal atophis head which further adorned with feathers he carried a stone hatchet andeven for someone as small as an ewok he walked with a definite swagger 
 he examined the group cursorily then seemed to make some kind ofpronouncement at that a member of the hunting party stepped mantled ewok who seemed to have taken a more protective view toward theprisoners 
 teebo conferred with paploo for a short time the discussion soon turned intoa heated disagreement however with paploo apparently taking the rebels side andteebo seemingly dismissing whatever considerations arose the rest of the tribestood around watching the debate with great interest occasionally shouting commentsor squeaking excitedly 
 threepio whose had been set down in a place of honor near thestake to which solo was tied followed the ongoing argument with rapt began to translate once or twice for luke and the stopped after only afew words since the debaters were talking so fast he want to lose the gist ofwhat was being said consequently he transmit any more information thanthe names of the ewoks involved 
 han looked over at luke with a dubious frown i like the looks of this 
 chewie growled his wholehearted agreement 
 suddenly logray exited from the large hut silencing everyone with his than teebo he was nonetheless clearly the object of greater general too wore a on his kind of great bird skull a single feathertied to its crest his fur was striped tan though and his face wise he carried noweapon only a pouch at his side and a staff topped by the spine of a 
 one by one he carefully appraised the captives smelling han testing the fabricof clothing between his fingers teebo and paploo babbled their opposingpoints of view at him but he seemed supremely uninterested so they soon stopped 
 when logray came to chewbacca he became fascinated and poked at thewookiee with his staff of growled dangerously at the tiny logray neededno further coaching and did a quick the same time reaching into hispouch and sprinkling some herbs in direction 
 careful chewie han cautioned from across the square he must be thehead honcho 
 no threepio corrected actually i believe their medicine man 
 luke was about to intervene then decided to wait it would be better if thisserious little community came to its own conclusions about them in its own ewoks seemed curiously grounded for a people so airborne 
 logray wandered over to examine a most wondrous creature hesniffed tapped and stroke the metal shell then scrunched up his face in a lookof consternation after a few moments of thought he ordered the small robot cutdown 
 the crowd murmured excitedly and backed off a few feet vine binderswere slashed by two guards causing the droid to slide down his poleand crash unceremoniously to the ground 
 the guards set him upright artoo was instantly furious he zeroed in onteebo as the source of his ignominy and beeping a blue streak began to chase theterrified ewok in circles the crowd cheering on teebo somesqueaking encouragement to the deranged droid 
 finally artoo got close enough to teebo to zing him with an electric shocked ewok jumped into the air squealed raucously and ran away as fast ashis stubby little legs could carry him wicket slipped surreptitiously into the big the onlookers screeched their indignation or delight 
 threepio was incensed artoo stop that only going to make mattersworse 
 artoo scooted over directly in front of the golden droid and began beeping avehement tirade wreee op doo rhee vrrr gk gdk dk whoo dop dhop vree doodweet 
 this outburst miffed threepio substantially with a haughty tilt he sat upstraight in his throne no way to speak to someone in my position 
 luke was afraid the situation was well on its way to getting out of control hecalled with the barest hint of impatience to his faithful droid threepio i think you spoke on our behalf 
 ungraciously to the assemblage of fuzzycreatures and made a short speech pointing from time to time to his friends tied to thestakes 
 logray became visibly upset by this he waved his staff stamped his at the golden droid for a full minute at the conclusion of his statement henodded to several attentive fellows who nodded back and began filling the pit underhan with firewood 
 well what did he say han shouted with some concern 
 threepio wilted with chagrin rather embarrassed captain solo but itappears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor he is quiteoffended that i should suggest otherwise 
 before another word could be said began beating in ominoussyncopation as one all the furry heads turned toward the mouth of the large of it came wicket and behind him chief chirpa 
 chirpa was gray of fur strong of will on his head he bore a garland woven ofleaves teeth and the horns of great animals bested in the hunt in his righthand he carried a staff fashioned from the longbone of a flying reptile in his left heheld an iguana who was his pet and advisor 
 he surveyed the scene in the square at a glance then turned to wait for the guestwho was only now emerging from the large hut behind him 
 the guest was the beautiful young princess of alderaan 
 leia luke and han shouted together 
 rahrhah 
 boo deedwee 
 your highness 
 with a gasp she rushed toward her friends but a phalanx of ewoks blocked herway with spears she turned to chief chirpa then to her robot interpreter 
 threepio tell them these are my friends they must be set free 
 threepio looked at chirpa and logray eep sqee rheeow he said with muchcivility sqeeow roah meep meeb eerah 
 chirpa and logray shook their heads with a motion that was unequivocablynegative logray chattered an order at his helpers who resumed vigorously pilingwood under solo 
 han exchanged helpless looks with leia somehow i have a feeling do us much good 
 luke what can we do leia urged she expected this at all a guide back to her ship or at worst a short supper and lodging for the definitely understand these creatures luke she questioned 
 han was about to offer a suggestion when he paused briefly taken aback sudden intense faith in luke it was something he really noted merely noted it now 
 before he could speak up with his plan though luke chimed in them if they do as you wish become angry and use your magic 
 but master luke what magic the droid protested i 
 tell them luke ordered uncharacteristically raising his voice there weretimes when threepio could test even the patience of a jedi 
 the turned to the large audience and spoke with great screesh oahr aish sh sheestee meep eep eep 
 the ewoks seemed greatly disturbed by this proclamation they all backed upseveral steps except for logray who took two steps forward he shouted somethingat that sounded very in the nature of challenge 
 luke closed his eyes with absolute concentration threepio began rattling on ina terribly unsettled manner as if been caught falsifying his own believe me master luke just as i told you 
 luke listening to the droid though he was visualizing him seeing himsitting shiny and golden on his throne of twigs nodding this way and that prattling onabout the most inconsequential of matters sitting there in the black void of slowly beginning to rise 
 slowly threepio began to rise 
 at first he notice at first nobody did threepio just went right ontalking as his entire litter steadily elevated off the ground told you i told you itold you they i know why a here 
 threepio and the ewoks all realized what was happening at just about the samemoment the ewoks silently fell back in terror from the floating throne threepionow began to spin as if he were on a revolving stool graceful majestic spinning 
 help he whispered artoo help me 
 chief chirpa shouted orders to his cowering minions quickly they ran forwardand released the bound prisoners leia han and luke enfolded each other in a embrace it seemed to all of them a strange setting in which to gain thefirst victory of this campaign against the empire 
 luke was aware of a plaintive beeping behind him and turned to see artoostaring up at a threepio luke lowered the golden droid slowly to theground 
 thanks threepio the young jedi patted him gratefully on the shoulder 
 threepio still a bit shaken stood with a wobbly amazed know i had it in me 
 the hut of chief chirpa was large by ewok nearly scraped the ceiling with his head the wookiee hunchedalong one side of the dwelling with his rebel comrades while the chief and tenelders sat on the other side facing them in the center between the two groups asmall fire warmed the night air casting ephemeral shadows on the earthen walls 
 outside the entire village awaited the decisions this council would arrive at itwas a pensive clear night charged with high moment though it was quite late notan ewok slept 
 inside threepio was speaking positive and negative feedback loops hadalready substantially increased his fluency in this squeaky language he was now inthe midst of an animated history of the galactic civil with explosive sound effects and editorial commentary he even mimicked animperial walker at one point 
 the ewok elders listened carefully occasionally murmuring comments to eachother it was a fascinating story and they were thoroughly at times outraged logray conferred with chief chirpa once or twice andseveral times asked threepio questions to which the golden droid responded artoo even whistled probably for emphasis 
 in the end though after a rather brief discussion among the elders the chiefshook his head negatively with an expression of rueful dissatisfaction he spokefinally to threepio and threepio interpreted for his friends 
 chief chirpa says a very moving story the droid explained but it reallyhas nothing to do with ewoks 
 a deep and pressing silence filled the small chamber only the fire softlycrackled its bright but darkling soliloquy 
 it was finally all opened his mouth to speak for the the alliance 
 tell them this goldenrod he smiled at the droid with conscious affectionfor the first time tell them hard to translate a rebellion so maybe a tell the story so tell em 
 they help us cause asking em to they even helpus cause in their own interest though it is you for oneexample the tappin a lot of energy out of this moon to generate its deflectorshield and a lot of energy you guys are gonna be without come winter and imean gonna be never mind that tell em threepio 
 threepio told them han went on 
 but not why they should help us why i used to do stuff becauseit was in my interest but not anymore well not so much anyway mostly i dothings for my friends what else is so important money had that and you know what happened to him okay okay the point areyour friends you know 
 this was one of the most inarticulate pleas leia had ever heard but it made hereyes fill with tears the ewoks on the other hand remained silent and the stoic little fellow named paploo traded a few muttered words the restwere motionless their expressions unreadable 
 after another protracted pause luke cleared his throat i realize this conceptmay be be difficult to draw these connections he started slowly terribly important for the entire galaxy for our rebel force to destroy the imperialpresence here on endor look up there through the smoke hole in the roof justthrough that tiny hole you can count a hundred stars in the whole sky there aremillions and billions more you even see and they all have planets andmoons and happy people just like you and the empire is destroying all that youcanyou could get dizzy just lying on your back and staring up at all the could almostexplode so beautiful sometimes and part of thebeauty all part of the same force and the empire is trying to turn out thelights 
 it took a while for threepio to finish translating wanted to get all thewords just right when he did eventually stop talking there was an extensivesqueaking among the elders rising and falling in volume ceasing and then resumingagain 
 leia knew what luke was trying to say but she feared greatly that the see the connection it was connected intimately though if she could onlybridge the gap for them she thought of her experience in the forest of oneness with the trees whose outstretched limbs seemed to touch the verystars the stars whose light filtered down like cascading magic she felt the powerof the magic within her and it resonated around the hut from being to being flowingthrough her again making her stronger still until she felt one with these as if she understood them knew them conspired with them in theprimary sense of the word they breathed together 
 the debate wound down leaving finally another quiet moment in the respirations quieted too in resonance and with an air of confident made her appeal to the council 
 do it because of the trees she said 
 all she said everyone expected more but there was no more only thisshort oblique outburst 
 wicket had been observing these proceedings with increasing concern from thesidelines on several occasions it was apparent he was restraining himself with greatdifficulty from entering the now he jumped to his feet pacedthe width of the hut several times finally faced the elders and began his ownimpassioned speech 
 eep eep meep eek squee 
 threepio translated for his friends honorable elders we have this nightreceived a perilous wondrous gift the gift of freedom this threepio paused in his translation just long enough to savor themoment then went golden god whose return to us has been prophesiedsince the first tree tells us now he will not be our master tells us we are free tochoose as we we must choose as all living things must choose their owndestiny he has come honorable elders and he will go no longer may we be slavesto his diving guidance we are free 
 yet how must we comport ourselves is an love of the wood any lessbecause he can leave it love is more because he can leave it yet he is it with the voice of the golden one we can close our eyes yet we listen 
 his friends tell us of a force a great living spirit of which we are all part evenas the leaves are things separate yet part of the tree we know this spirit honorableelders though we call it not the force the friends of the golden one tell us thisforce is in great jeopardy here and everywhere when the fire reaches the is safe not even the great tree of which all things are part nor its leaves norits roots not its birds all are in peril forever and ever 
 it is a brave thing to confront such a fire honorable elders many will the forest lives on 
 but the ewoks are brave 
 the little fixed his gaze on the others in the hut not a word wasspoken nonetheless the communication was intense after a minute like this heconcluded his statement 
 honorable elders we must aid this noble party not less for the trees but morefor the sake of the leaves on the trees these rebels are like the ewoks who are likethe leaves battered by the wind eaten without thought by the tumult of locusts thatinhabit the do we throw ourselves on smoldering fires that another mayknow the warmth of light yet do we make a soft bed of ourselves that another mayknow rest yet do we swirl in the wind that assails us to send the fear of chaos into thehearts of our enemies yet do we change color even as the season calls upon us tochange so must we help our leafbrothers these so has come a seasonof change upon us 
 he stood still before them the small fire dancing in his eye for a timelessmoment all the world seemed still 
 the elders were moved without saying another word they nodded inagreement perhaps they were telepathic 
 in any case chief chirpa stood and without preface made a briefpronouncement 
 all at once drums began to beat throughout the entire village the eldersjumped longer at all so ran across the tent to hug the even began to hug artoo but thought better of it as the little droid backed offwith a low warning whistle teebo scurried over to hop playfully on the instead 
 han smiled uncertainly going on 
 not sure leia answered out the side of her mouth but it look toobad 
 luke like the others was sharing the joyous it pleasant smile and diffuse good will when suddenly a dark cloud filled her there nestled a clammy chill into the corners of his soul he wiped itstraces from his visage made his face a mask nobody noticed 
 threepio finally nodded his understanding to wicket who was explaining thesituation to him he turned with an expansive gesture to the rebels we are nowpart of the tribe 
 just what always wanted said solo 
 threepio continued talking to the others trying to ignore the sarcastic starcaptain the chief has vowed to help us in any way to rid their land of the evilones 
 well short help is better than no help i always say solo chuckled 
 threepio was once again rapidly overheating his circuits toward the corellianingrate teebo says his chief scouts wicket and paploo will show us the fastestway to the shield generator 
 tell him thanks goldenrod he just loved irking threepio he himself 
 chewie let out a righteous bark happy to be on the move again one of theewoks thought he was asking for food though and brought the wookiee a large slabof meat chewbacca refuse he downed the meat in a single gulp as severalewoks gathered watching in amazement they were so incredulous at this feat infact they began giggling furiously and the laughter was so infectious it started thewookiee chortling his gruff guffaws were really hilarious to the chuckling was their jumped on him in a frenzy of tickling which hereturned threefold until they all lay in a puddle quite exhausted chewie wiped hiseyes and grabbed another piece of meat which he gnawed at a more leisurely pace 
 solo meanwhile began organizing the expedition how far is it needsome fresh supplies not much time you know give me some of 
 chewie snarled 
 luke drifted to the back of the hut and then slipped outside during thecommotion out in the square a great party was going luke avoided this too he wandered away from the bonfires awayfrom the gaiety to a secluded walkway on the dark side of a colossal tree 
 leia followed him 
 the sounds of the forest filled the soft night air here crickets skitteringrodents desolate breezes anguished owls the perfumes were a mixture jasmine and pine the harmonies were strictly ethereal the sky wascrystal black 
 luke stared at the brightest star in the heavens it looked to be fired from deepwithin its core by raging elemental vapors it was the death star 
 he take his eyes from it leia found him like that 
 wrong she whispered 
 he smiled wearily everything afraid or nothing maybe maybethings are finally going to be as they were meant to be 
 he felt the presence of darth vader very near 
 leia took his hand she felt so close to luke yetshe say how heseemed so lost now so alone so distant she almost felt his hand in is it luke 
 he looked down at their intertwined fingers leiado you remember yourmother your real mother 
 the question took her totally by surprise always felt so close to heradopted parents it was as if they were her real parents she almost never thought ofher real was like a dream 
 yet now question made her start flashes from her infancy visions of runninga beautiful womanhiding in a trunk thefragments suddenly threatened to flood her with emotion 
 yes she said pausing to regain her composure just a little bit she diedwhen i was very young 
 what do you remember he pressed tell me 
 just feelings reallyimages she wanted to let it slide it was so out of theblue so far from her immediate concernsbut somehow so loud inside all of asudden 
 tell me luke repeated 
 she felt surprised by his insistence but decided to follow him with it at least forthe time being she trusted him even when he frightened her she was verybeautiful leia remembered aloud gentle and sad she lookeddeeply into his eyes seeking his intentions why are you asking me this 
 he turned away peering back up at the death star as if been on the vergeof opening up then something scared him and he pulled it all in once more i haveno memory of my mother he claimed i never knew her 
 luke tell me troubling you she wanted to help she knew she couldhelp 
 he stared at her a long moment estimating her abilities gauging her need toknow her desire to know she was strong he felt it unwaveringly he coulddepend on her they all could vader is herenow on this moon 
 she felt a chill like a physical sensation as if her blood had actually do you know 
 i can feel his presence come for me 
 but how could he know we were here was it the code did we leave out somepassword she knew it was none of these things 
 no me he can feel it when near he held her by the wanted to tell her everything but now as he tried his will was starting to must leave you leia as long as here i endanger the whole group and ourmission here his hands trembled i have to face vader 
 leia was fast becoming distraught confused intimations were rushing at herlike wild owls out of the night their wings brushing her cheek their talons catchingher hail their harsh whispers thrilling her ear who who who 
 she shook her head hard i understand luke what do you mean youhave to face vader 
 he pulled her to him his manner suddenly gentle abidingly calm to say to say it in some basic way released him my father leia 
 your father she believe it yet of course it was true 
 he held her steady to be a rock for her leia found something else not going to be easy for you to hear it but you have to you have to knownbefore i leave here because i might not be back and if i make it theonly hope for the alliance 
 she looked away she shook her head she look at him it was terriblydisturbing what luke was saying though she imagine why it wasnonsense of course that was why to call her the only hope for the alliance if heshould it was absurd absurd to think of luke dying and to think of herbeing the only hope both thoughts were out of the question she moved away from him to deny hiswords at least to give them distance to let her breathe flashes of her mother cameagain in this breathing space parting embraces flesh torn from flesh 
 talk that way luke you have to survive i do what i of no importance without youi can do nothing you seen it you have a power i understandand could never have 
 wrong leia he held her at length you have that power force is strong in you in time learn to use it as i have 
 she shook her head she hear this he was lying she had nopower the power was elsewhere she could only help and succor and support whatwas he saying was it possible 
 he brought her closer still held her face in his hands 
 he looked so tender now so giving was he giving her the power could shetruly hold it what was he saying luke come over you 
 leia the force is strong in my family my father has it i have it and mysister has it 
 leia stared full into his eyes again darkness whirled there and she saw frightened herbut now this time she draw away she stoodclose to him she started to understand 
 yes he whispered seeing her comprehension yes you leia heheld her in his arms 
 leia closed her eyes tightly against his words against her tears to no all washed over her now and through her i know she nodded openly shewept 
 then you know i must go to him 
 she stood back her face hot her mind swimming in a storm no luke away far away if he can feel your presence go away from this place sheheld his hands put her cheek on his chest i wish i could go with you 
 he stroked the back of her head no you never han and i and the others have doubted always been strong turned away from your responsibility i say the same he thought ofhis premature flight from dagobah racing to risk everything before his training hadbeen complete almost destroying everything because of it he looked down at theblack mechanical hand he had to show for it how much more would be lost to hisweakness well he choked now both going to fulfill our destinies 
 luke why why must you confront him 
 he thought of all the win to lose to join to struggle to kill to walk away to accuse to ask why to forgive to not forgive to knew inthe end there was only one reason now and always only one reason that couldever matter good in him felt it he give me over to theemperor i can save him i can turn him back to the good side his eyes becamewild for just a moment turn by doubts and passions i have to try leia ourfather 
 they held each other close tears streamed silently down her face 
 goodbye dear and found goodbye sweet sweet leia 
 she cried openly both luke held her away and movedslowly back along the planking he disappeared into the darkness of the led out of the village 
 leia watched him go quietly weeping she gave free vent to her feelings didnot try to stop the instead to feel them to feel the source they came path they took the murky corners they cleansed 
 memories poured through her now clues suspicions mutteringswhen thought she was asleep luke her brother and vader her was too much to assimilate all at once it was information overload 
 she was crying and trembling and whimpering all at once when suddenly hanstepped up and embraced her from behind gone looking for her and heard hervoice and came around just in time to see luke only now when leiajumped at his touch and he turned her around did he realize she was sobbing 
 his quizzical smile turned to concern tempered by the of the hey going on here 
 she stifled her sobs wiped her eyes nothing han i just want to bealone for a while 
 she was hiding something that much was plain and that much was not nothing he said angrily i want to know going on now you tellme what it is he shook her never felt like this before he wanted toknow but he want to know what he thought he knew it made him sick atheart to think of leiawith lukehe even bring himself to imagine what itwas he want to imagine 
 never been out of control like this he like it he stop it herealized he was still shaking her and stopped 
 i han her lip began to tremble again 
 you you tell me i thought we were closer than that but i guessi was wrong maybe rather tell luke sometimes i 
 oh han she cried and burst into tears once more she buried herself in hisembrace 
 his anger turned slowly to confusion and dismay as he found himself wrappinghis arms around her caressing her shoulders comforting her sorry hewhispered into her hair sorry he understand not an her or himself or his feelings or women or the he knew was that just been furious and now he was affectionate made no sense 
 pleasejust hold me she whispered she want to talk she justwanted to be held 
 he just held her 
 morning mist rose off dewy vegetation as the sun broke the horizon over lush foliage of the edge had a moist green odor in that dawning momentthe world was silent as if holding its breath 
 in violent contrast the imperial landing platform squatted over the metallic octagonal it seemed to cut like an insult into the verdant beauty ofthe place the bushes at its perimeter were singed black from repeated shuttlelandings the flora beyond that was from refuse disposal tramplingfeet chemical exhaust fumes like a blight was this outpost 
 uniformed troops walked continuously on the platform and in the surveilling guarding imperial walkers were parked off to armored war machines big enough for a squad of soldiersto stand inside firing laser cannon in all directions an imperial shuttle took off forthe death star with a roar that made the trees cringe another walker emerged fromthe timber on the far side of the platform returning from a patrol mission step bylumbering step it approached the loading dock 
 darth vader stood at the rail of the lower deck staring mutely into the depths ofthe lovely forest soon it was coming soon he could feel it like a drum gettinglouder his destiny approached dread was all around but fear like this excited he let it bubble quietly within dread was a tonic it heightened his senses honeda raw edge to his passions closer it came 
 victory too he sensed mastery but laced with something elsewhat was see it quite always in motion the future difficult to see itsapparitions tantalized him swirling specters always changing smoky was hisfuture thunderous with conquest and destruction 
 very close now almost here 
 he purred in the pit of his throat like a wild cat smelling game on the air 
 almost here 
 the imperial walker docked at the opposite end of the deck and opened its phalanx of stormtroopers marched out in tight circular formation toward vader 
 he turned around to face the oncoming troopers his breathing even his blackrobes hanging still in the windless morning the stormtroopers stopped when theyreached him and at a word from their captain parted to reveal a bound prisoner intheir midst it was luke skywalker 
 the young jedi gazed at vader with complete calm with many layers of vision 
 the stormtrooper captain spoke to lord vader this is the rebel thatsurrendered to us although he denies it i believe there may be more of them and irequest permission to conduct a wider search of the area he extended his hand tothe dark lord in it he held lightsaber he was armed only with this 
 vader looked at the lightsaber a moment then slowly took it from the leave us conduct your search and bring his companions to me 
 the officer and his troops withdrew back to the walker 
 luke and vader were left standing along facing each other in the emeraldtranquillity of the ageless forest the mist was beginning to burn off long dayahead

 two of the shots had already flown across the bridge where there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was body was jammed against the railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince nesvitski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile 
 what a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow you wait a moment you see the general wants to pass 
 but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to the left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense mass looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisy little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides moved across the bridge 
 as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are there many more of you to come 
 a million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat with a wink and passed on followed by another an old man 
 if he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now said the old soldier dismally to a comrade forget to scratch yourself 
 that soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cart 
 where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderly running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it 
 and he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking 
 and then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily with a wide swing of his arm 
 yes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh and they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with it 
 bah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think all be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully 
 as it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier with an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt like dying of fright i did pon my word i got that frightened said he as if bragging of having been frightened 
 that one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweaned baby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face bore almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the women 
 just see the german sausage is making tracks too 
 sell me the missis said another soldier addressing the german who angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyes 
 see how smart made herself oh the devils 
 there fedotov you should be quartered on them 
 i have seen as much before now mate 
 where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl 
 the german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand 
 take it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple 
 the girl smiled and took it nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed when they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the same kind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the whole crowd had to wait 
 and why are they stopping no proper order said the soldiers where are you shoving to devil take you you wait be worse if he fires the bridge see an officer jammed in too different voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked at one another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge 
 looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approaching something big that splashed into the water 
 just see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly looking round at the sound 
 encouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasily 
 the crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball 
 hey cossack my horse he said now then you there get out of the way make way 
 with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shouting continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind 
 nesvitski nesvitski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behind him 
 nesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry vaska denisov red and shaggy with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder 
 tell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisov evidently in a fit of rage his eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face 
 ah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski up with you 
 the squadwon pass shouted vaska denisov showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foam from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him what is this like sheep just like sheep out of the way let us pass stop there you devil with the cart hack you with my saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it 
 the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and denisov joined nesvitski 
 it not drunk today said nesvitski when the other had ridden up to him 
 they even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they mean to fight fight but the devil knows what this is 
 what a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking at new cloak and saddlecloth 
 denisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume and put it to nose 
 of course going into action shaved bwushed my teeth and scented myself 
 the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack and the determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order and having done this he rode back 
 having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw nearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in front and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it 
 the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in regular order 
 smart lads only fit for a fair said one 
 what good are they led about just for show remarked another 
 kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers 
 like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve perched up there more like a bird than a man 
 there now zikin they ought to put you on a horse look fine said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack 
 take a stick between your legs suit you for a horse the hussar shouted back

 chapter 
 
 whatever his motive might have been laurie studied to some purpose that year for he graduated with honor and gave the latin oration with the grace of a phillips and the eloquence of a demosthenes so his friends said they were all there his so and mrs march john and meg jo and beth and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time but fail to win from the world by any 
 got to stay for this confounded supper but i shall be home early tomorrow come and meet me as usual girls laurie said as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over he said girls but he meant jo for she was the only one who kept up the old custom she had not the heart to refuse her splendid successful boy anything and answered warmly 
 come teddy rain or shine and march before you playing hail the conquering hero comes on a 
 laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic oh deary me i know say something and then what shall i do evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears and having decided that she be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be she set forth at the appointed time hoping teddy do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings a call at and a refreshing sniff and sip at the daisy and demijohn still further fortified her for the but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away 
 the jo cried laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance 
 
 i forgot it and jo took heart again for that salutation could not be called loverlike 
 she always used to take his arm on these occasions now she did not and he made no complaint which was a bad sign but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred to rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling jo said hastily now you must have a good long holiday 
 i intend to 
 something in his resolute tone made jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come and made her put out her hand with an imploring no teddy please 
 i will and you must hear me no use jo got to have it out and the sooner the better for both of us he answered getting flushed and excited all at once 
 say what you like then listen said jo with a desperate sort of patience 
 laurie was a young lover but he was in earnest and meant to have it out if he died in the attempt so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity saying in a voice that would get choky now and then in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady 
 loved you ever since known you jo help it been so good to me tried to show it but you let me now going to make you hear and give me an answer for i go on so any longer 
 i wanted to save you this i thought understand began jo finding it a great deal harder than she expected 
 i know you did but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean they say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it returned laurie entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact 
 i i never wanted to make you care for me so and i went away to keep you from it if i could 
 i thought so it was like you but it was no use i only loved you all the more and i worked hard to please you and i gave up billiards and everything you like and waited and never complained for i hoped love me though not half good enough here there was a choke that be controlled so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his confounded throat 
 you you are a great deal too good for me and so grateful to you and so proud and fond of you i know why i love you as you want me to tried but i change the feeling and it would be a lie to say i do when i 
 really truly jo he stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget 
 really truly dear 
 they were in the grove now close by the stile and when the last words fell reluctantly from lips laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on but for once in his life the fence was too much for him so he just laid his head down on the mossy post and stood so still that jo was frightened 
 oh teddy sorry so desperately sorry i could kill myself if it would do any good i wish you take it so hard i help it you know impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they cried jo inelegantly but remorsefully as she softly patted his shoulder remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago 
 they do sometimes said a muffled voice from the post i believe the right sort of love and rather not try it was the decided answer 
 there was a long pause while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river and the tall grass rustled in the wind presently jo said very soberly as she sat down on the step of the stile laurie i want to tell you something 
 he started as if he had been shot threw up his head and cried out in a fierce tone tell me that jo i bear it now 
 tell what she asked wondering at his violence 
 that you love that old man 
 what old man demanded jo thinking he must mean his grandfather 
 that devilish professor you were always writing about if you say you love him i know i shall do something desperate and he looked as if he would keep his word as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes 
 jo wanted to laugh but restrained herself and said warmly for she too was getting excited with all this swear teddy he old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend got next to you pray fly into a passion i want to be kind but i know i shall get angry if you abuse my professor i the least idea of loving him or anybody else 
 but you will after a while and then what will become of me 
 love someone else too like a sensible boy and forget all this trouble 
 i love anyone else and never forget you jo never never with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words 
 what shall i do with him sighed jo finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected you heard what i wanted to tell you sit down and listen for indeed i want to do right and make you happy she said hoping to soothe him with a little reason which proved that she knew nothing about love 
 seeing a ray of hope in that last speech laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile and looked up at her with an expectant face now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on part for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him she gently turned his head away saying as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her touching that was to be sure i agree with mother that you and i are not suited to each other because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable if we were so foolish as to jo paused a little over the last word but laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression 
 we if you loved me jo i should be a perfect saint for you could make me anything you like 
 no i tried and failed and i risk our happiness by such a serious experiment we agree and we never shall so be good friends all our lives but we go and do anything rash 
 yes we will if we get the chance muttered laurie rebelliously 
 now do be reasonable and take a sensible view of the case implored jo almost at her end 
 i be reasonable i want to take what you call a sensible view it help me and it only makes it harder i believe got any heart 
 
 i wish i 
 there was a little quiver in voice and thinking it a good omen laurie turned round bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before disappoint us dear everyone expects it grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and i get on without you say you will and be happy do do 
 not until months afterward did jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could it was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel 
 i say yes truly so i say it at all see that right and thank me for it she began solemnly 
 be hanged if i do and laurie bounced up off the grass burning with indignation at the very idea 
 yes you will persisted jo get over this after a while and find some lovely accomplished girl who will adore you and make a fine mistress for your fine house i homely and awkward and odd and old and be ashamed of me and we should help it even now you i like elegant society and you would and hate my scribbling and i get on without it and we should be unhappy and wish we done it and everything would be horrid 
 anything more asked asked laurie finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst 
 nothing more except that i believe i shall ever marry happy as i am and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man 
 i know better broke in laurie you think so now but come a time when you will care for somebody and love him tremendously and live and die for him i know you will your way and i shall have to stand by and see it and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical if his face had not been so tragic 
 yes i will live and die for him if her ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself and you must do the best you can cried jo losing patience with poor teddy done my best but you be reasonable and selfish of you to keep teasing for what i give i shall always be fond of you very fond indeed as a friend but never marry you and the sooner you believe it the better for both of now 
 that speech was like gunpowder laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself then turned sharply away saying in a desperate sort of tone be sorry some day jo 
 oh where are you going she cried for his face frightened her 
 to the devil was the consoling answer 
 for a minute heart stood still as he swung himself down the bank toward the river but it takes much folly sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death and laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure he had no thought of a melodramatic plunge but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat and row away with all his might making better time up the river than he had done in any race jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart 
 that will do him good and come home in such a tender penitent state of mind that i dare to see him she said adding as she went slowly home feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing and buried it under the leaves now i must go and prepare mr laurence to be very kind to my poor boy i wish love beth perhaps he may in time but i begin to think i was mistaken about her oh dear how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them i think dreadful 
 being sure that no one could do it so well as herself she went straight to mr laurence told the hard story bravely through and then broke down crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman though sorely disappointed did not utter a reproach he found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving laurie and hoped she would change her mind but he knew even better than jo that love cannot be forced so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of way for young parting words to jo disturbed him more than he would confess 
 when laurie came home dead tired but quite composed his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two but when they sat together in the twilight the time they used to enjoy so much it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last success which to him now seemed like labor lost he bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play the were open and jo walking in the garden with beth for once understood music better than her sister for he played the sonata pathetique and played it as he never did before 
 very fine i dare say but sad enough to make one cry give us something gayer lad said mr laurence whose kind old heart was full of sympathy which he longed to show but knew not how 
 laurie dashed into a livelier strain played stormily for several minutes and would have got through bravely if in a momentary lull mrs voice had not been heard calling jo dear come in i want you 
 just what laurie longed to say with a different meaning as he listened he lost his place the music ended with a broken chord and the musician sat silent in the dark 
 i stand this muttered the old gentleman up he got groped his way to the piano laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders and said as gently as a woman i know my boy i know 
 no answer for an instant then laurie asked sharply who told you 
 jo herself 
 then an end of it and he shook off his hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his pride could not bear a pity 
 not quite i want to say one thing and then there shall be an end of it returned mr laurence with unusual mildness you care to stay at home now perhaps 
 i intend to run away from a girl jo prevent my seeing her and i shall stay and do it as long as i like interrupted laurie in a defiant tone 
 not if you are the gentleman i think you disappointed but the girl help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time where will you go 
 anywhere i care what becomes of me and laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his ear 
 take it like a man and do anything rash for sake why not go abroad as you planned and forget it 
 i 
 but been wild to go and i promised you should when you got through college 
 ah but i mean to go alone and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see 
 i ask you to go alone someone ready and glad to go with you anywhere in the world 
 who sir stopping to listen 
 myself 
 laurie came back as quickly as he went and put out his hand saying huskily a selfish brute 
 lord help me yes i do know for been through it all before once in my own young days and then with your father now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan all settled and can be carried out at once said mr laurence keeping hold of the young man as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him 
 well sir what is it and laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice 
 there is business in london that needs looking after i meant you should attend to it but i can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them my partners do almost everything merely holding on until you take my place and can be off at any time 
 but you hate traveling sir i ask it of you at your age began laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all the old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices so stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly bless your soul not superannuated yet i quite enjoy the idea it will do me good and my old bones suffer for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair 
 a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily i mean to be a marplot or a burden i go because i think feel happier than if i was left behind i intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while i amuse myself in my own way friends in london and paris and should like to visit them meantime you can go to italy germany switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your content 
 now laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness he sighed and then said in a spiritless tone just as you like sir it matter where i go or what i do 
 it does to me remember that my lad i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it promise me that laurie 
 anything you like sir 
 good thought the old gentleman you care now but come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or much mistaken 
 being an energetic individual mr laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off during the time necessary for preparation laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases he was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even mrs march to attempt consolation or offer sympathy on some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and everyone rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable 
 when the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves this gaiety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till mrs march kissed him whit a whisper full of motherly solicitude then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round he did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic 
 oh jo you 
 teddy dear i wish i could 
 that was all except a little pause then laurie straightened himself up said all right never mind and went away without another word ah but it all right and jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy laurie never would come again

 harry felt himself slam flat into the ground his face was pressed into grass the smell of it filled his nostrils he had closed his eyes while the portkey transported him and he kept them closed now he did not move all the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship to hold himself steady he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching the smooth cold handle of the triwizard cup and body he felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground breathing in the smell of the grass waitingwaiting for someone to do somethingsomething to happenand all the while his scar burned dully on his forehead 
 
 a torrent of sound deafened and confused him there were voices everywhere footsteps remained where he was his face screwed up against the noise as though it were a nightmare that would pass 
 
 then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over 
 
 harry harry 
 
 he opened his eyes 
 
 he was looking up at the starry sky and albus dumbledore was crouched over him the dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them pushing nearer harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps

 dumbledore bent down and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin raised harry from the ground and set him on his feet harry swayed his head was pounding his injured leg would no longer support his weight the crowd around them jostled fighting to get closer pressing darkly in on him happened wrong with him dead

 girls were screaming sobbing scene flickered oddly before eyes 
 
 its all right son got youcome onhospital wing 
 
 dumbledore said stay said harry thickly the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up his vision was blurring worse than ever 
 
 you need to lie on now 
 
 someone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling half carrying him through the frightened crowd harry heard people gasping screaming and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them taking him back to the castle across the lawn past the lake and the durmstrang ship harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk 
 
 what happened harry the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps clunk clunk clunk it was moody

 harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands

 moody helped tip the stuff down throat he coughed a peppery taste burning his throat office came into sharper focus and so did moody looked as white as fudge had looked and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon face 
 
 back harry sure back how did he do it 
 
 he took stuff from his grave and from wormtail and me said harry his head felt clearer his scar hurting so badly he could now see face distinctly even though the office was dark he could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant quidditch field 
 
 what did the dark lord take from you said moody 
 
 blood said harry raising his arm his sleeve was ripped where dagger had torn it 
 
 moody let out his breath in a long low hiss 
 
 and the death eaters they returned 
 
 yes said harry loads of them 
 
 how did he treat them moody asked quietly did he forgive them 
 
 but harry had suddenly remembered he should have told dumbledore he should have said it straightaway 
 
 a death eater at hogwarts a death eater here they put my name in the goblet of fire they made sure i got through to the end 
 
 harry tried to get up but moody pushed him back down 
 
 i know who the death eater is he said quietly 
 
 karkaroff said harry wildly where is he have you got him is he locked up 
 
 karkaroff said moody with an odd laugh karkaroff fled tonight when he felt the dark mark burn upon his arm he betrayed too many faithful supporters of the dark lord to wish to meet thembut i doubt he will get far the dark lord has ways of tracking his enemies 
 
 gone he ran away but then he put my name in the goblet 
 
 no said moody slowly no he it was i who did that 
 
 harry heard but believe 
 
 no you he said you do thatyou have done 
 
 i assure you i did said moody and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door and harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it at the same time moody drew out his wand and pointed it at harry 
 
 he forgave them then he said the death eaters who went free the ones who escaped azkaban 
 
 what said harry 
 
 he was looking at the wand moody was pointing at him this was a bad joke it had to be 
 
 i asked you said moody quietly whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him those treacherous cowards who even brave azkaban for him the faithless worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the quidditch world cup but fled at the sight of the dark mark when i fired it into the sky 
 
 you firedwhat are you talking about 
 
 i told you harryi told you if one thing i hate more than any other a death eater who walked free they turned their backs on my master when he needed them most i expected him to punish them i expected him to torture them tell me he hurt them harry face was suddenly lit with an insane smile tell me he told them that i i alone remained faithfulprepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above allyou 
 
 you it be you 
 
 who put your name in the goblet of fire under the name of a different school i did who frightened off every person i thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament i did who nudged hagrid into showing you the dragons i did who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon i did 
 
 magical eye had now left the door it was fixed upon harry his lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever 
 
 it been easy harry guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion i have had to use every ounce of cunning i possess so that my hand would not be detectable in your success dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily as long as you got into that maze preferably with a decent head start then i knew i would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear but i also had to contend with your stupidity the second taskthat was when i was most afraid we would fail i was keeping watch on you potter i knew you worked out the clue so i had to give you another hint 
 
 you harry said hoarsely cedric gave me the clue 
 
 who told cedric to open it underwater i did i trusted that he would pass the information on to you decent people are so easy to manipulate potter i was sure cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons and so he did but even then potter even then you seemed likely to fail i was watching all the timeall those hours in the library you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along i planted it there early on i gave it to the longbottom boy you remember magical water plants of the mediterranean it would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed i expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help longbottom would have told you in an instant but you did notyou did have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all 
 
 so what could i do feed you information from another innocent source you told me at the yule ball a called dobby had given you a christmas present i called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning i staged a loud conversation with professor mcgonagall about the hostages who had been taken and whether potter would think to use gillyweed and your little elf friend ran straight to office and then hurried to find you 
 
 wand was still pointing directly at heart over his shoulder foggy shapes were moving in the on the wall 
 
 you were so long in that lake potter i thought you had drowned but luckily dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility and marked you high for it i breathed again 
 
 you had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight of course said moody i was patrolling around it able to see through the outer hedges able to curse many obstacles out of your way i stunned fleur delacour as she passed i put the imperius curse on krum so that he would finish diggory and leave your path to the cup clear 
 
 harry stared at moody he just see how this could friend the famous aurorthe one who had caught so many death eatersit made no senseno sense at all 
 
 the foggy shapes in the were sharpening had become more distinct harry could see the outlines of three people over shoulder moving closer and closer but moody watching them his magical eye was upon harry 
 
 the dark lord manage to kill you potter and he so wanted to whispered moody imagine how he will reward me when he finds i have done it for him i gave you to him the thing he needed above all to regenerate and then i killed you for him i will be honored beyond all other death eaters i will be his dearest his closest supportercloser than a son 
 
 normal eye was bulging the magical eye fixed upon harry the door was barred and harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time 
 
 the dark lord and i said moody and he looked completely insane now towering over harry leering down at him have much in common both of us for instance had very disappointing fathersvery disappointing indeed both of us suffered the indignity harry of being named after those fathers and both of us had the pleasurethe very great pleasureof killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the dark order 
 
 mad harry said he stop himself mad 
 
 mad am i said moody his voice rising uncontrollably see see mad now that the dark lord has returned with me at his side he is back harry potter you did not conquer him and now i conquer you 
 
 moody raised his wand he opened his mouth harry plunged his own hand into his robes 
 
 stupefy there was a blinding flash of red light and with a great splintering and crashing the door of office was blasted apart 
 
 moody was thrown backward onto the office floor harry still staring at the place where face had been saw albus dumbledore professor snape and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the he looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway dumbledore in front his wand outstretched 
 
 at that moment harry fully understood for the first time why people said dumbledore was the only wizard voldemort had ever feared the look upon face as he stared down at the unconscious form of moody was more terrible than harry could have ever imagined there was no benign smile upon face no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles there was cold fury in every line of the ancient face a sense of power radiated from dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat 
 
 he stepped into the office placed a foot underneath unconscious body and kicked him over onto his back so that his face was visible snape followed him looking into the where his own face was still visible glaring into the room professor mcgonagall went straight to harry 
 
 come along potter she whispered the thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry come alonghospital wing 
 
 no said dumbledore sharply 
 
 dumbledore he ought to look at him been through enough tonight 
 
 he will stay minerva because he needs to understand said dumbledore curtly understanding is the first step to acceptance and only with acceptance can there be recovery he needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight and why 
 
 moody harry said he was still in a state of complete disbelief how can it have been moody 
 
 this is not alastor moody said dumbledore quietly you have never known alastor moody the real moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight the moment he took you i knew and i followed 
 
 dumbledore bent down over limp form and put a hand inside his robes he pulled out hip flask and a set of keys on a ring then he turned to professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 severus please fetch me the strongest truth potion you possess and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the called winky minerva kindly go down to house where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch take the dog up to my office tell him i will be with him shortly then come back here 
 
 if either snape or mcgonagall found these instructions peculiar they hid their confusion both turned at once and left the office dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks fitted the first key in the lock and opened it it contained a mass of dumbledore closed the trunk placed a second key in the second lock and opened the trunk again the spellbooks had vanished this time it contained an assortment of broken some parchment and quills and what looked like a silvery invisibility cloak harry watched astounded as dumbledore placed the third fourth fifth and sixth keys in their respective locks reopening the trunk each time and revealing different contents each time then he placed the seventh key in the lock threw open the lid and harry let out a cry of amazement 
 
 he was looking down into a kind of pit an underground room and lying on the floor some ten feet below apparently fast asleep thin and starved in appearance was the real moody his wooden leg was gone the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing harry stared thunderstruck between the sleeping moody in the trunk and the unconscious moody lying on the floor of the office 
 
 dumbledore climbed into the trunk lowered himself and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping moody he bent over him 
 
 stunned controlled by the imperius curse very weak he said of course they would have needed to keep him alive harry throw down the cloak freezing madam pomfrey will need to see him but he seems in no immediate danger 
 
 harry did as he was told dumbledore covered moody in the cloak tucked it around him and clambered out of the trunk again then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk unscrewed it and turned it over a thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor 
 
 polyjuice potion harry said dumbledore you see the simplicity of it and the brilliance for moody never does drink except from his hip flask well known for it the imposter needed of course to keep the real moody close by so that he could continue making the potion you see his hair dumbledore looked down on the moody in the trunk the imposter has been cutting it off all year see where it is uneven but i think in the excitement of tonight our fake moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have doneon the hourevery shall see 
 
 dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it his eyes fixed upon the unconscious moody on the floor harry stared at him too minutes passed in silence 
 
 then before very eyes the face of the man on the floor began to change the scars were disappearing the skin was becoming smooth the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink the long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw suddenly with a loud clunk the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place next moment the magical eyeball had popped out of the face as a real eye replaced it it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction 
 
 harry saw a man lying before him slightly freckled with a mop of fair hair he knew who he was he had seen him in pensieve had watched him being led away from court by the dementors trying to convince mr crouch that he was innocentbut he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older 
 
 there were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor snape had returned with winky at his heels professor mcgonagall was right behind them 
 
 crouch snape said stopping dead in the doorway barty crouch 
 
 good heavens said professor mcgonagall stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor 
 
 filthy disheveled winky peered around legs her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek 
 
 master barty master barty what is you doing here 
 
 she flung herself forward onto the young chest 
 
 you is killed him you is killed him you is killed son 
 
 he is simply stunned winky said dumbledore step aside please severus you have the potion 
 
 snape handed dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid the veritaserum with which he had threatened harry in class dumbledore got up bent over the man on the floor and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the in which the reflections of dumbledore snape and mcgonagall were still glaring down upon them all winky remained on her knees trembling her hands over her face dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said ennervate 
 
 son opened his eyes his face was slack his gaze unfocused dumbledore knelt before him so that their faces were level 
 
 can you hear me dumbledore asked quietly 
 
 the eyelids flickered 
 
 yes he muttered 
 
 i would like you to tell us said dumbledore softly how you came to be here how did you escape from azkaban 
 
 crouch took a deep shuddering breath then began to speak in a flat expressionless voice 
 
 my mother saved me she knew she was dying she persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her he loved her as he had never loved me he agreed they came to visit me they gave me a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs she took a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs we took on each appearance 
 
 winky was shaking her head trembling 
 
 say no more master barty say no more you is getting your father into trouble 
 
 but crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice 
 
 the dementors are blind they sensed one healthy one dying person entering azkaban they sensed one healthy one dying person leaving it my father smuggled me out disguised as my mother in case any prisoners were watching through their doors 
 
 my mother died a short while afterward in azkaban she was careful to drink polyjuice potion until the end she was buried under my name and bearing my appearance everyone believed her to be me 
 
 the eyelids flickered 
 
 and what did your father do with you when he had got you home said dumbledore quietly 
 
 staged my death a quiet private funeral that grave is empty the nursed me back to health then i had to be concealed i had to be controlled my father had to use a number of spells to subdue me when i had recovered my strength i thought only of finding my masterof returning to his service 
 
 how did your father subdue you said dumbledore 
 
 the imperius curse moody said i was under my fathers control i was forced to wear an invisibility cloak day and night i was always with the she was my keeper and caretaker she pitied me she persuaded my father to give me occasional treats rewards for my good behavior 
 
 master barty master barty sobbed winky through her hands you ought to tell them we is getting in trouble 
 
 did anybody ever discover that you were still alive said dumbledore softly did anyone know except your father and the 
 
 yes said crouch his eyelids flickering again a witch in my office bertha jorkins she came to the house with papers for my signature he was not at home winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen to me but bertha jorkins heard winky talking to me she came to investigate she heard enough to guess who was hiding under the invisibility cloak my father arrived home she confronted him he put a very powerful memory charm on her to make her forget what found out too powerful he said it damaged her memory permanently 
 
 why is she coming to nose into my masters private business sobbed winky why she leaving us be 
 
 tell me about the quidditch world cup said dumbledore 
 
 winky talked my father into it said crouch still in the same monotonous voice she spent months persuading him i had not left the house for years i had loved quidditch let him go she said he will be in his invisibility cloak he can watch let him smell fresh air for once she said my mother would have wanted it she told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom she had not saved me for a life of imprisonment he agreed in the end 
 
 it was carefully planned my father led me and winky up to the top box early in the day winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father i was to sit there invisible when everyone had left the box we would emerge winky would appear to be alone nobody would ever know 
 
 but winky know that i was growing stronger i was starting to fight my imperius curse there were times when i was almost myself again there were brief periods when i seemed outside his control it happened there in the top box it was like waking from a deep sleep i found myself out in public in the middle of the match and i saw in front of me a wand sticking out of a boys pocket i had not been allowed a wand since before azkaban i stole it winky know winky is frightened of heights she had her face hidden 
 
 master barty you bad boy whispered winky tears trickling between her fingers 
 
 so you took the wand said dumbledore and what did you do with it 
 
 we went back to the tent said crouch then we heard them we heard the death eaters the ones who had never been to azkaban the ones who had never suffered for my master they had turned their backs on him they were not enslaved as i was they were free to seek him but they did not they were merely making sport of muggles the sound of their voices awoke me my mind was clearer than it had been in years i was angry i had the wand 
 
 i wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master my father had left the tent he had gone to free the muggles winky was afraid to see me so angry she used her own brand of magic to bind me to her she pulled me from the tent pulled me into the forest away from the death eaters i tried to hold her back i wanted to return to the campsite i wanted to show those death eaters what loyalty to the dark lord meant and to punish them for their lack of it i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the sky 
 
 ministry wizards arrived they shot stunning spells everywhere one of the spells came through the trees where winky and i stood the bond connecting us was broken we were both stunned 
 
 when winky was discovered my father knew i must be nearby he searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there he waited until the other ministry members had left the forest he put me back under the imperius curse and took me home he dismissed winky she had failed him she had let me acquire a wand she had almost let me escape 
 
 winky let out a wail of despair 
 
 now it was just father and i alone in the house and thenand then head rolled on his neck and an insane grin spread across his face my master came for me 
 
 he arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant wormtail my master had found out that i was still alive he had captured bertha jorkins in albania he had tortured her she told him a great deal she told him about the triwizard tournament she told him the old auror moody was going to teach at hogwarts he tortured her until he broke through the memory charm my father had placed upon her she told him i had escaped from azkaban she told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master and so my master knew that i was still his faithful servant perhaps the most faithful of all my master conceived a plan based upon the information bertha had given him he needed me he arrived at our house near midnight my father answered the door 
 
 the smile spread wider over face as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers she seemed too appalled to speak 
 
 it was very quick my father was placed under the imperius curse by my master now my father was the one imprisoned controlled my master forced him to go about his business as usual to act as though nothing was wrong and i was released i awoke i was myself again alive as i been in years 
 
 and what did lord voldemort ask you to do said dumbledore 
 
 he asked me whether i was ready to risk everything for him i was ready it was my dream my greatest ambition to serve him to prove myself to him he told me he needed to place a faithful servant at hogwarts a servant who would guide harry potter through the triwizard tournament without appearing to do so a servant who would watch over harry potter ensure he reached the triwizard cup turn the cup into a portkey which would take the first person to touch it to my master but first 
 
 you needed alastor moody said dumbledore his blue eyes were blazing though his voice remained calm 
 
 wormtail and i did it we had prepared the polyjuice potion beforehand we journeyed to his house moody put up a struggle there was a commotion we managed to subdue him just in time forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk took some of his hair and added it to the potion i drank it i became double i took his leg and his eye i was ready to face arthur weasley when he arrived to sort out the muggles who had heard a disturbance i made the dustbins move around the yard i told arthur weasley i had heard intruders in my yard who had set off the dustbins then i packed up clothes and dark detectors put them in the trunk with moody and set off for hogwarts i kept him alive under the imperius curse i wanted to be able to question him to find out about his past learn his habits so that i could fool even dumbledore i also needed his hair to make the polyjuice potion the other ingredients were easy i stole skin from the dungeons when the potions master found me in his office i said i was under orders to search it 
 
 and what became of wormtail after you attacked moody said dumbledore 
 
 wormtail returned to care for my master in my house and to keep watch over my father 
 
 but your father escaped said dumbledore 
 
 yes after a while he began to fight the imperius curse just as i had done there were periods when he knew what was happening my master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house he forced him to send letters to the ministry instead he made him write and say he was ill but wormtail neglected his duty he was not watchful enough my father escaped my master guessed that he was heading for hogwarts my father was going to tell dumbledore everything to confess he was going to admit that he had smuggled me from azkaban 
 
 my master sent me word of my escape he told me to stop him at all costs so i waited and watched i used the map i had taken from harry potter the map that had almost ruined everything 
 
 map said dumbledore quickly what map is this 
 
 map of hogwarts potter saw me on it potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the polyjuice potion from office one night he thought i was my father we have the same first name i took the map from potter that night i told him my father hated dark wizards potter believed my father was after snape 
 
 for a week i waited for my father to arrive at hogwarts at last one evening the map showed my father entering the grounds i pulled on my invisibility cloak and went down to meet him he was walking around the edge of the forest then potter came and krum i waited i could not hurt potter my master needed him potter ran to get dumbledore i stunned krum i killed my father 
 
 noooo wailed winky master barty master barty what is you saying 
 
 you killed your father dumbledore said in the same soft voice what did you do with the body 
 
 carried it into the forest covered it with the invisibility cloak i had the map with me i watched potter run into the castle he met snape dumbledore joined them i watched potter bringing dumbledore out of the castle i walked back out of the forest doubled around behind them went to meet them i told dumbledore snape had told me where to come 
 
 dumbledore told me to go and look for my father i went back to my body watched the map when everyone was gone i transfigured my body he became a bonei buried it while wearing the invisibility cloak in the freshly dug earth in front of cabin 
 
 there was complete silence now except for continued sobs then dumbledore said and tonight 
 
 i offered to carry the triwizard cup into the maze before dinner whispered barty crouch turned it into a portkey my plan worked he is returned to power and i will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards 
 
 the insane smile lit his features once more and his head drooped onto his shoulder as winky wailed and sobbed at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter beyond the veilcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them blocking their way left and right eyes glinted through slits in hoods a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts ginny gave a gasp of horror 
 
 to me potter repeated the drawling voice of lucius malfoy as he held out his hand palm up 
 
 insides plummeted sickeningly they were trapped and outnumbered two to one 
 
 to me said malfoy yet again 
 
 sirius harry said 
 
 several of the death eaters laughed a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to left said triumphantly the dark lord always knows 
 
 always echoed malfoy softly now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i want to know where sirius is 
 
 i want to know where sirius is mimicked the woman to his left 
 
 she and her fellow death eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from harry and the others the light from their wands dazzling eyes 
 
 got him said harry ignoring the rising panic in his chest the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the row here i know he is 
 
 the little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo said the woman in a horrible mock baby voice harry felt ron stir beside him 
 
 do anything harry muttered not yet 
 
 the woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter 
 
 you hear him you hear instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us 
 
 oh you know potter as i do bellatrix said malfoy softly he has a great weakness for heroics the dark lord understands this about him now give me the prophecy potter 
 
 i know sirius is here said harry though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly i know got him 
 
 more of the death eaters laughed though the woman laughed loudest of all 
 
 time you learned the difference between life and dreams potter said malfoy now give me the prophecy or we start using wands 
 
 go on then said harry raising his own wand to chest height as he did so the five wands of ron hermione neville ginny and luna rose on either side of him the knot in stomach tightened if sirius really was not here he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all 
 
 but the death eaters did not strike 
 
 hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt said malfoy coolly 
 
 it was turn to laugh 
 
 yeah right he said i give you thisprophecy is it and just let us skip off home will you 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when the female death eater shrieked accio proph 
 
 harry was just ready for her he shouted protego before she had finished her spell and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it 
 
 oh he knows how to play little bitty baby potter she said her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood very well then 
 
 i told you no lucius malfoy roared at the woman if you smash it 
 
 mind was racing the death eaters wanted this dusty sphere he had no interest in it he just wanted to get them all out of this alive to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity 
 
 the woman stepped forward away from her fellows and pulled off her hood azkaban had hollowed bellatrix face making it gaunt and but it was alive with a feverish fanatical glow 
 
 you need more persuasion she said her chest rising and falling rapidly very welltake the smallest one she ordered the death eaters beside her let him watch while we torture the little girl do it 
 
 harry felt the others close in around ginny he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her the prophecy held up to his chest 
 
 have to smash this if you want to attack any of us he told bellatrix i think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it will he 
 
 she did not move she merely stared at him the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth 
 
 so said harry what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway 
 
 he could not think what to do but to keep talking arm was pressed against his and he could feel him shaking he could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his head he was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this because his mind was blank 
 
 what kind of prophecy repeated bellatrix the grin fading from her face you jest harry potter 
 
 nope not jesting said harry his eyes flicking from death eater to death eater looking for a weak link a space through which they could escape how come voldemort wants it 
 
 several of the death eaters let out low hisses 
 
 you dare speak his name whispered bellatrix 
 
 yeah said harry maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him yeah got no problem with saying vol 
 
 shut your mouth bellatrix shrieked you dare speak his name with your unworthy lips you dare besmirch it with your tongue you dare 
 
 did you know a too said harry recklessly hermione gave a little moan in his ear voldemort yeah his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggleor has he been telling you lot 
 
 stupef 
 
 no 
 
 a jet of red light had shot from the end of bellatrix wand but malfoy had deflected it his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered 
 
 two figures as ghosts fluid as smoke unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak their voices vied with each other so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over malfoy and shouts 
 
 at the solstice will come a new said the figure of an old bearded man 
 
 do not attack we need the prophecy 
 
 he daredhe dares shrieked bellatrix incoherently he stands therefilthy 
 
 wait got the prophecy bawled malfoy 
 
 and none will come after said the figure of a young woman 
 
 the two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor they had however given harry an idea the problem was going to be conveying it to the others 
 
 you told me so special about this prophecy supposed to be handing over he said playing for time he moved his foot slowly sideways feeling around for someone 
 
 do not play games with us potter said malfoy 
 
 not playing games said harry half his mind on the conversation half on his wandering foot and then he found toes and pressed down upon them a sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were 
 
 what she whispered 
 
 dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the department of mysteries malfoy sneered 
 
 iwhat said harry and for a moment he quite forgot his plan what about my scar 
 
 what whispered hermione more urgently behind him 
 
 can this be said malfoy sounding maliciously delighted some of the death eaters were laughing again and under cover of their laughter harry hissed to hermione moving his lips as little as possible smash shelves 
 
 dumbledore never told you malfoy repeated well this explains why you come earlier potter the dark lord wondered why 
 
 when i say now 
 
 you come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams he thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording 
 
 did he said harry behind him he felt rather than heard hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking to distract the death eaters so he wanted me to come and get it did he why 
 
 why malfoy sounded incredulously delighted because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the department of mysteries potter are those about whom it was made as the dark lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him 
 
 and why did he want to steal a prophecy about me 
 
 about both of you potter about both of you you ever wondered why the dark lord tried to kill you as a baby 
 
 harry stared into the slitted through which grey eyes were gleaming was this prophecy the reason parents had died the reason he carried his scar was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand 
 
 someone made a prophecy about voldemort and me he said quietly gazing at lucius malfoy his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand it was hardly larger than a snitch and still gritty with dust and made me come and get it for him why he come and get it himself 
 
 get it himself shrieked bellatrix over a cackle of mad laughter 
 
 the dark lord walk into the ministry of magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return the dark lord reveal himself to the aurors when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin 
 
 so got you doing his dirty work for him has he said harry like he tried to get sturgis to steal itand bode 
 
 very good potter very good said malfoy slowly but the dark lord knows you are not unintell 
 
 now yelled harry 
 
 five different voices behind him bellowed reducto five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart figures unfurled into the air and floated there their voices echoing from who knew what past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor 
 
 run harry yelled as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above he seized a handful of robes and dragged her forwards holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them a death eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and harry elbowed him hard in the masked face they were all yelling there were cries of pain and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves weirdly echoing fragments of the seers unleashed from their spheres 
 
 harry found the way ahead clear and saw ron ginny and luna sprint past him their arms over their heads something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards a hand caught him by the shoulder he heard hermione shout stupefy the hand released him at once 
 
 they were at the end of row harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest he could hear footsteps right behind him and voice urging neville on straight ahead the door through which they had come was ajar harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through the doorway the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them 
 
 colloportus gasped hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise 
 
 wherewhere are the others gasped harry 
 
 he had thought ron luna and ginny were ahead of them that they would be waiting in this room but there was nobody there 
 
 they must have gone the wrong way whispered hermione terror in her face 
 
 listen whispered neville 
 
 footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard lucius malfoy roar leave nott leave him i say his injuries will be nothing to the dark lord compared to losing that prophecy jugson come back here we need to organise split into pairs and search and forget be gentle with potter until got the prophecy you can kill the others if necessarybellatrix rodolphus you take the left crabbe rabastan go rightjugson dolohov the door straight aheadmacnair and avery through hererookwood over there mulciber come with me 
 
 what do we do hermione asked harry trembling from head to foot 
 
 well we stand here waiting for them to find us for a start said harry get away from this door 
 
 they ran as quietly as they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room they were almost there when harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door hermione had charmed shut 
 
 stand aside said a rough voice alohomora 
 
 as the door flew open harry hermione and neville dived under desks they could see the bottom of the two death eaters robes drawing nearer their feet moving rapidly 
 
 they run straight through to the hall said the rough voice 
 
 check under the desks said another 
 
 harry saw the knees of the death eaters bend poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted stupefy 
 
 a jet of red light hit the nearest death eater he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over the second death eater however had leapt aside to avoid spell and was pointing his own wand at hermione who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim 
 
 avada 
 
 harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the death eater around the knees causing him to topple and his aim to go awry neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 both and the death wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the hall of prophecy both scrambled to their feet and charged after them the death eater in front harry hot on his heels and neville bringing up the rear plainly horrorstruck by what he had done 
 
 get out of the way harry yelled neville clearly determined to repair the damage 
 
 harry flung himself sideways as neville took aim again and shouted 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the jet of red light flew right over the death eaters shoulder and hit a cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart glass flying everywhere sprang back up on to the wall fully mended then fell down again and shattered 
 
 the death eater had snatched up his wand which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned his mask had slipped so that he see he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted stup 
 
 stupefy screamed hermione who had just caught up with them the jet of red light hit the death eater in the middle of his chest he froze his arm still raised his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar harry expected to hear a clunk for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor but instead his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest sprawled on his back on the table with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind 
 
 accio wand cried hermione wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him 
 
 thanks he said right get out of 
 
 look out said neville horrified he was staring at the death head in the bell jar 
 
 all three of them raised their wands again but none of them struck they were all gazing appalled at what was happening to the head 
 
 it was shrinking very fast growing balder and balder the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull his cheeks becoming smooth his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz 
 
 a head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick muscled neck of the death eater as he struggled to get up again but even as they watched their mouths open the head began to swell to its previous proportions again thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin 
 
 time said hermione in an awestruck voice time 
 
 the death eater shook his ugly head again trying to clear it but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more 
 
 there was a shout from a room nearby then a crash and a scream 
 
 ron harry yelled turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them ginny luna 
 
 harry hermione screamed 
 
 the death eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar his appearance was utterly bizarre his tiny head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions narrowly missing harry who had ducked harry raised his wand but to his amazement hermione seized his arm 
 
 you hurt a baby 
 
 there was no time to argue the point harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the hall of prophecy and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position 
 
 come on he said and leaving the ugly death eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room leading back into the black hallway 
 
 they had run halfway towards it when harry saw through the open door two more death eaters running across the black room towards them veering left he burst instead into a small dark cluttered office and slammed the door behind them 
 
 collo began hermione but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two death eaters had come hurtling inside 
 
 with a cry of triumph both yelled 
 
 impedimenta 
 
 harry hermione and neville were all knocked backwards off their feet neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books the back of head slammed into the stone wall behind him tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react 
 
 got him yelled the death eater nearest harry in an office off 
 
 silencio cried hermione and the voice was extinguished he continued to mouth through the hole in his mask but no sound came out he was thrust aside by his fellow death eater 
 
 petrificus totalus shouted harry as the second death eater raised his wand his arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards face down on to the rug at feet stiff as a board and unable to move 
 
 well done ha 
 
 but the death eater hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across chest she gave a tiny oh as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor where she lay motionless 
 
 hermione 
 
 harry fell to his knees beside her as neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk his wand held up in front of him the death eater kicked out hard at head as he emergedhis foot broke wand in two and connected with his face neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose harry twisted around his own wand held high and saw that the death eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at harry who recognised the long pale twisted face from the daily dolohov the wizard who had murdered the prewetts 
 
 dolohov grinned with his free hand he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in hand to himself then at hermione though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer give me the prophecy or you get the same as her 
 
 like you kill us all anyway the moment i hand it over said harry 
 
 a whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly he had one hand on shoulder which was still warm yet did not dare look at her properly let her be dead let her be dead my fault if dead 
 
 whaddever you do harry said neville fiercely from under the desk lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin gib it to him 
 
 then there was a crash outside the door and dolohov looked over his shoulderthe death eater had appeared in the doorway his head bawling his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him harry seized his chance 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 the spell hit dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch 
 
 hermione harry said at once shaking her as the death eater blundered out of sight again hermione wake up 
 
 whaddid he do to her said neville crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose 
 
 i dunno 
 
 neville groped for wrist 
 
 a pulse harry sure id is 
 
 such a powerful wave of relief swept through harry that for a moment he felt 
 
 alive 
 
 yeah i dink so 
 
 there was a pause in which harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the death eater in the next room 
 
 neville not far from the exit harry whispered right next to that circular room if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more death eaters come bet you can get hermione up the corridor and into the lift then you could find someone raise the alarm 
 
 and whad are you going do do said neville mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at harry 
 
 got to find the others said harry 
 
 well going do find dem wid you said neville firmly 
 
 but hermione 
 
 dake her wid us said neville firmly carry bedder at fighding dem dan i ab 
 
 he stood up and seized one of arms glaring at harry who hesitated then grabbed the other and helped hoist limp form over shoulders 
 
 wait said harry snatching up wand from the floor and shoving it into hand better take this 
 
 neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door 
 
 my going do kill be said neville thickly blood spattering from his nose as he spoke dat was by old wand 
 
 harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously the death eater was screaming and banging into things toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks bawling and confused while the cabinet that harry now suspected had contained continued to fall shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them 
 
 never going to notice us he whispered keep close behind me 
 
 they crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway which now seemed completely deserted they walked a few steps forwards neville tottering slightly due to weight the door of the time room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more the recent blow on the back of head seemed to have unsteadied him he narrowed his eyes swaying slightly until the walls stopped moving again with a sinking heart harry saw that fiery crosses had faded from the doors 
 
 so which way reck 
 
 but before they could make a decision as to which way to try a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it 
 
 ron croaked harry dashing towards them ginnyare you all 
 
 harry said ron giggling weakly lurching forwards seizing the front of robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes there you are ha ha ha you look funny harry all messed up 
 
 face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth next moment his knees had given way but he still clutched the front of robes so that harry was pulled into a kind of bow 
 
 ginny harry said fearfully what happened 
 
 but ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position panting and holding her ankle 
 
 i think her broken i heard something crack whispered luna who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets it was a very odd place some of the time we were just floating in the dark 
 
 harry we saw uranus up close said ron still giggling feebly get it harry we saw uranusha ha ha 
 
 a bubble of blood grew at the corner of mouth and burst 
 
 anyway one of them grabbed foot i used the reductor curse and blew up pluto in his face but 
 
 luna gestured hopelessly at ginny who was breathing in a very shallow way her eyes still closed 
 
 and what about ron said harry fearfully as ron continued to giggle still hanging off the front of robes 
 
 i know what they hit him with said luna sadly but gone a bit funny i could hardly get him along at all 
 
 harry said ron pulling ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly you know who this girl is harry loony loony lovegood ha ha ha 
 
 got to get out of here said harry firmly luna can you help ginny 
 
 yes said luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping then putting an arm around waist and pulling her up 
 
 only my ankle i can do it myself said ginny impatiently but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed luna for support harry pulled arm over his shoulder just as so many months ago he had pulled he looked around they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time 
 
 he heaved ron towards a door they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three death eaters sped in led by bellatrix lestrange 
 
 there they are she shrieked 
 
 stunning spells shot across the room harry smashed his way through the door ahead flung ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help neville in with hermione they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against bellatrix 
 
 colloportus shouted harry and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side 
 
 it matter said a voice there are other ways got them here 
 
 harry span around they were back in the brain room and sure enough there were doors all around the walls he could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more death eaters came running to join the first 
 
 lunaneville help me 
 
 the three of them tore around the room sealing the doors as they went harry crashed into a tbale and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door 
 
 colloportus 
 
 there were footsteps running along behind the doors every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one so it creaked and shuddered luna and neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wallthen as harry reached the very top of the room he heard luna cry 
 
 colloaaaaaaaaargh 
 
 he turned in time to see her flying through the air five death eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time luna hit a desk slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled as still as hermione 
 
 get potter shrieked bellatrix and she ran at him he dodged her and sprinted back up the room he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy 
 
 hey said ron who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards harry giggling hey harry there are brains in here ha ha ha that weird harry 
 
 ron get out of the way get down 
 
 but ron had already pointed his wand at the tank 
 
 honest harry brainslookaccio brain 
 
 the scene seemed momentarily frozen harry ginny and neville and each of the death eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish for a moment it seemed suspended in midair then it soared towards ron spinning as it came and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it unravelling like rolls of film 
 
 ha ha ha harry look at it said ron watching it disgorge its gaudy innards harry come and touch it bet weird 
 
 ron no 
 
 harry did not know what would happen if ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain but he was sure it would not be anything good he darted forwards but ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands 
 
 the moment they made contact with his skin the tentacles began wrapping themselves around arms like ropes 
 
 harry look happennonoi like itno stopstop 
 
 but the thin ribbons were spinning around chest now he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an body 
 
 diffindo yelled harry trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around ron before his eyes but they would not break ron fell over still thrashing against his bonds 
 
 harry suffocate him screamed ginny immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor then a jet of red light flew from one of the death wands and hit her squarely in the face she keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious 
 
 stubefy shouted neville wheeling around and waving wand at the oncoming death eaters stubefy stubefy 
 
 but nothing happened 
 
 one of the death eaters shot their own stunning spell at neville it missed him by inches harry and neville were now the only two left fighting the five death eaters two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them harry ran for it as bellatrix lestrange raced right at him holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room all he could think of doing was to draw the death eaters away from the others 
 
 it seemed to have worked they streaked after him knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy and he dashed through the only door still open the one through which the death eaters themselves had come inwardly praying that neville would stay with ron and find some way of releasing him he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish 
 
 he was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step bouncing on every tier until at last with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais the whole room was ringing with the death laughter he looked up and saw the five who had been in the brain room descending towards him while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand his wand clutched tightly in his right he backed away looking around trying to keep all the death eaters within his sight the back of his legs hit something solid he had reached the dais where the archway stood he climbed backwards onto it 
 
 the death eaters all halted gazing at him some were panting as hard as he was one was bleeding badly dolohov freed of the curse was leering his wand pointing straight at face 
 
 potter your race is run drawled lucius malfoy pulling off his mask now hand me the prophecy like a good boy 
 
 letlet the others go and give it to you said harry desperately 
 
 a few of the death eaters laughed 
 
 you are not in a position to bargain potter said lucius malfoy his pale face flushed with pleasure you see there are ten of us and only one of you or dumbledore ever taught you how to count 
 
 dot alone shouted a voice from above them still god be 
 
 heart sank neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them wand held fast in his trembling hand 
 
 nevilleno go back to ron 
 
 stubefy neville shouted again pointing his wand at each death eater in turn stubefy stube 
 
 one of the largest death eaters seized neville from behind pinioning his arms to his sides he struggled and kicked several of the death eaters laughed 
 
 longbottom it sneered lucius malfoy well your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause your death will not come as a great shock 
 
 longbottom repeated bellatrix and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face why i have had the pleasure of meeting your parents boy 
 
 i doe you hab roared neville and he fought so hard against his encircling grip that the death eater shouted someone stun him 
 
 no no no said bellatrix she looked transported alive with excitement as she glanced at harry then back at neville no see how long longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents unless potter wants to give us the prophecy 
 
 gib id do dem roared neville who seemed beside himself kicking and writhing as bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor her wand raised gib id do dem harry 
 
 bellatrix raised her wand crucio 
 
 neville screamed his legs drawn up to his chest so that the death eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground the death eater dropped him and he fell to the floor twitching and screaming in agony 
 
 that was just a taster said bellatrix raising her wand so that screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet she turned and gazed up at harry now potter either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way 
 
 harry did not have to think there was no choice the prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out malfoy jumped forwards to take it 
 
 then high above them two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room sirius lupin moody tonks and kingsley 
 
 malfoy turned and raised his wand but tonks had already sent a stunning spell right at him harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact but dived off the dais out of the way the death eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the order who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor through the darting bodies the flashes of light harry could see neville crawling along he dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach neville 
 
 are you ok he yelled as another spell soared inches over their heads 
 
 yes said neville trying to pull himself up 
 
 and ron 
 
 i dink all righdhe was still fighding de brain when i lefd 
 
 the stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it leaving a crater right where hand had been only seconds before both scrambled away from the spot then a thick arm came out of nowhere seized harry around the neck and pulled him upright so that his toes were barely touching the floor 
 
 give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy 
 
 the man was pressing so tightly on windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eyes he saw sirius duelling with a death eater some ten feet away kingsley was fighting two at once tonks still halfway up the tiered seats was firing spells down at bellatrixnobody seemed to realise that harry was dying he turned his wand backwards towards the side but had no breath to utter an incantation and the free hand was groping towards the hand in which harry was grasping the prophecy 
 
 aargh 
 
 neville had come lunging out of nowhere unable to articulate a spell he had jabbed wand hard into the eyehole of the death mask the man relinquished harry at once with a howl of pain harry whirled around to face him and gasped 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the death eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off it was macnair killer one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot 
 
 thanks harry said to neville pulling him aside as sirius and his death eater lurched past duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs then foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy but then he saw magical eye spinning away across the floor 
 
 its owner was lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon harry and neville dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee 
 
 tarantallegra he shouted his wand pointing at neville whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again now potter 
 
 he made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on hermione just as harry yelled protego 
 
 harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over jerking legs but the shield charm had stopped the worst of the spell 
 
 dolohov raised his wand again accio proph 
 
 sirius had hurtled out of nowhere rammed dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way the prophecy had again flown to the tips of fingers but he had managed to cling on to it now sirius and dolohov were duelling their wands flashing like swords sparks flying from their 
 
 dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on harry and hermione springing up harry yelled petrificus totalus once again arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards landing with a crash on his back 
 
 nice one shouted sirius forcing head down as a pair of stunning spells flew towards them now i want you to get out of 
 
 they both ducked again a jet of green light had narrowly missed sirius across the room harry saw tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and bellatrix triumphant running back towards the fray 
 
 harry take the prophecy grab neville and run sirius yelled dashing to meet bellatrix harry did not see what happened next kingsley swayed across his field of vision battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked rookwood another jet of green light flew over head as he launched himself towards neville 
 
 can you stand he bellowed in ear as legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably put your arm round my neck 
 
 neville did so harry legs were still lying in every direction they would not support him and then out of nowhere a man lunged at them both fell backwards legs waving wildly like an overturned harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed 
 
 the prophecy give me the prophecy potter snarled lucus voice in his ear and harry felt the tip of wand pressing hard between his ribs 
 
 nogetoff me nevillecatch it 
 
 harry flung the prophecy across the floor neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest malfoy pointed the wand instead at neville but harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled impedimenta 
 
 malfoy was blasted off his back as harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw malfoy smash into the dais on which sirius and bellatrix were now duelling malfoy aimed his wand at harry and neville again but before he could draw breath to strike lupin had jumped between them 
 
 harry round up the others and go 
 
 harry seized neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step 
 
 a spell hit the stone bench at heel it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below neville sank to the ground his legs still jerking and thrashing and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket 
 
 come on said harry desperately hauling at robes just try and push with your legs 
 
 he gave another stupendous heave and robes tore all along the left seamthe small ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it one of floundering feet kicked it it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them as both of them stared at the place where it had broken appalled at what had happened a figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air unnoticed by any but them harry could see its mouth moving but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them not one word of the prophecy could he hear the figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness 
 
 harry sorry cried neville his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder so sorry harry i bean do 
 
 it matter harry shouted just try and stand get out of 
 
 dubbledore said neville his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over shoulder 
 
 what 
 
 dubbledore 
 
 harry turned to look where neville was staring directly above them framed in the doorway from the brain room stood albus dumbledore his wand aloft his face white and furious harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his bodythey were saved 
 
 dumbledore sped down the steps past neville and harry who had no more thoughts of leaving dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the death eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others one of the death eaters ran for it scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line 
 
 only one pair was still battling apparently unaware of the new arrival harry saw sirius duck jet of red light he was laughing at her 
 
 come on you can do better than that he yelled his voice echoing around the cavernous room 
 
 the second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest 
 
 the laughter had not quite died from his face but his eyes widened in shock 
 
 harry released neville though he was unaware of doing so he was jumping down the steps again pulling out his wand as dumbledore too turned towards the dais 
 
 it seemed to take sirius an age to fall his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch 
 
 harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his wasted face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind then fell back into place 
 
 harry heard bellatrix triumphant scream but knew it meant nothingsirius had only just fallen through the archway he would reappear from the other side any second 
 
 but sirius did not reappear 
 
 sirius harry yelled sirius 
 
 he had reached the floor his breath coming in searing gasps sirius must be just behind the curtain he harry would pull him back out 
 
 but as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais lupin grabbed harry around the chest holding him back 
 
 nothing you can do harry 
 
 get him save him only just gone through 
 
 too late harry 
 
 we can still reach him harry struggled hard and viciously but lupin would not let go 
 
 nothing you can do harry nothing gone 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter kings crosscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he lay facedown listening to the silence he was perfectly alone nobody was watching nobody else was there he was not perfectly sure that he was there himself 
 
 a long time later or maybe no time at all it came to him that he must exist must be more than disembodied thought because he was lying definitely lying on some surface therefore he had a sense of touch and the thing against which he lay existed too 
 
 almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion harry became conscious that he was naked convinced as he was of his total solitude this did not concern him but it did intrigue him slightly he wondered whether as he could feel he would be able to see in opening them he discovered that he had eyes 
 
 he lay in a bright mist though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before his surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings the floor on which he lay seemed to be white neither warm nor cold but simply there a flat blank something on which to be 
 
 he sat up his body appeared unscathed he touched his face he was not wearing glasses anymore 
 
 then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him the small soft thumpings of something that flapped flailed and struggled it was a pitiful noise yet also slightly indecent he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive shameful 
 
 for the first time he wished he were clothed 
 
 barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away he took them and pulled them on they were soft clean and warm it was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that the moment he had wanted them 
 
 he stood up looking around was he in some great room of requirement the longer he looked the more there was to see a great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight perhaps it was a palace all was hushed and still except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist 
 
 harry turned slowly on the spot and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes a space bright and clean a hall larger by far than the great hall with that clear domed glass ceiling it was quite empty he was the only person there except for c he recoiled he had spotted the thing that was making the noises it had the form of a small naked child curled on the ground its skin raw and rough and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left unwanted stuffed out of sight struggling for breath 
 
 he was afraid of it small and fragile and wounded though it was he did not want to approach it nevertheless he drew slowly nearer ready to jump back at any moment soon he stood near enough to touch it yet he could not bring himself to do it he felt like a coward he ought to comfort it but it repulsed him 
 
 you cannot help 
 
 he spun around albus dumbledore was walking toward him sprightly and upright wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue 
 
 harry he spread his arms wide and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged you wonderful boy you brave brave man let us walk 
 
 stunned harry followed as dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering leading him to two seats that harry had not previously noticed set some distance away under that high sparkling ceiling dumbledore sat down in one of them and harry fell into the other staring at his old headmasters face dumbledores long silver hair and beard the piercingly blue eyes behind spectacles the crooked nose everything was as he had remembered it and yet 
 
 but youre dead said harry 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore 
 
 then im dead too 
 
 ah said dumbledore smiling still more broadly that is the question isnt it on the whole dear boy i think not 
 
 they looked at each other the old man still beaming 
 
 not repeated harry 
 
 not said dumbledore 
 
 but harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar it did not seem to be there but i should have died c i didnt defend myself i meant to let him kill me 
 
 and that said dumbledore will i think have made all the difference 
 
 happiness seemed to radiate from dumbledore like light like fire harry had never seen the man so utterly so palpably content 
 
 explain said harry 
 
 but you already know said dumbledore he twiddled his thumbs together 
 
 i let him kill me said harry didnt i 
 
 you did said dumbledore nodding go on 
 
 so the part of his soul that was in me 
 
 dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically urging harry onward a broad smile of encouragement on his face 
 
 has it gone 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore yes he destroyed it your soul is whole and completely your own harry 
 
 but then 
 
 harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small maimed creature trembled under the chair 
 
 what is that professor 
 
 something that is beyond either of our help said dumbledore 
 
 but if voldemort used the killing curse harry started again and nobody died for me this time c how can i be alive 
 
 i think you know said dumbledore think back remember what he did in his ignorance in his greed and his cruelty 
 
 harry thought he let his gaze drift over his surroundings if it was indeed a palace in which they sat it was an odd one with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there and still he and dumbledore and the stunted creatures under the chair were the only beings there then the answer rose to his lips easily without effort 
 
 he took my blood said harry 
 
 precisely said dumbledore he took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it your blood in his veins harry lilys protection inside both of you he tethered you to life while he lives 
 
 i live while he lives but i thought i thought it was the other way around i thought we both had to die or is it the same thing 
 
 he was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again 
 
 are you sure we cant do anything 
 
 there is no help possible 
 
 then explain more said harry and dumbledore smiled 
 
 you were the seventh horcrux harry the horcrux he never meant to make he had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil the murder of your parents the attempted killing of a child but what escaped from that room was even less than he knew he left more than his body behind he left part of himself latched to you the victim who had survived 
 
 and his knowledge remained woefully incomplete harry that which voldemort does not value he takes no trouble to comprehend of and childrens tales of love loyalty and innocence voldemort knows and understands nothing nothing that they all have a power beyond his own a power beyond the reach of any magic is a truth he has never grasped 
 
 he took your blood believing it would strengthen him he took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you his body keeps her sacrifice alive and while that enchantment survives so do you and so does voldemorts one last hope for himself 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and harry stared at him 
 
 and you knew this you knew c all along 
 
 i guessed but my guesses have usually been good said dumbledore happily and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble 
 
 theres more said harry theres more to it why did my wand break the wand he borrowed 
 
 as to that i cannot be sure 
 
 have a guess then said harry and dumbledore laughed 
 
 what you must understand harry is that you and lord voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested but here is what i think happened and it is unprecedented and no wandmaker could i think ever have predicted or explained it to voldemort 
 
 without meaning to as you now know lord voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form a part of his soul was still attached to yours and thinking to strengthen himself he took a part of your mothers sacrifice into himself if he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice he would not perhaps have dared to touch your blood but then if he had been able to understand he could not be lord voldemort and might never have murdered at all 
 
 having ensured this connection having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours and now something very strange happened as we know the cores reacted in a way that lord voldemort who never knew that your wand was a twin of his had ever expected 
 
 he was more afraid than you were that night harry you had accepted even embraced the possibility of death something lord voldemort has never been able to do your courage won your wand overpowered his and in doing so something happened between those wands something that echoed the relationship between their masters 
 
 i believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of voldemorts wand that night which is to say that it contained a little of voldemort himself so your wand recognized him when he pursued you recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him magic much more powerful than anything luciuss wand had ever performed your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of voldemorts own deadly skill what chance did that poor stick of lucius malfoys stand 
 
 but if my wand was so powerful how come hermione was able to break it asked harry 
 
 my dear boy its remarkable effects were directed only at voldemort who had tampered so with the deepest laws of magic only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful otherwise it was a wand like any other though a good one i am sure dumbledore finished kindly 
 
 harry sat in thought for a long time or perhaps seconds it was very hard to be sure of things like time here 
 
 he killed me with your wand 
 
 he failed to kill you with my wand dumbledore corrected harry i think we can agree that you are not dead c though of course he added as if fearing he had been discourteous i do not minimize your sufferings which i am sure were severe 
 
 i feel great at the moment though said harry looking down at his clean unblemished hands where are we exactly 
 
 well i was going to ask you that said dumbledore looking around where would you say that we are 
 
 until dumbledore had asked harry had not known now however he found that he had an answer ready to give 
 
 it looks he said slowly like kings cross station except a lo cleaner and empty and there are no trains as far as i can see 
 
 kings cross station dumbledore was chuckling immoderately good gracious really 
 
 well where do you think we are asked harry a little defensively 
 
 my dear boy i have no idea this is as they say your party 
 
 harry had no idea what this meant dumbledore was being infuriating he glared at him then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location 
 
 the deathly hallows he said and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from dumbledores face 
 
 ah yes he said he even looked a little worried 
 
 well 
 
 for the first time since harry had met dumbledore he looked less than an old man much less he looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing 
 
 can you forgive me he said can you forgive me for not trusting you for not telling you harry i only feared that you would fail as i had failed i only dreaded that you would make my mistakes i crave your pardon harry i have known for some time now that you are the better man 
 
 what are you talking about asked harry startled by dumbledores tone by the sudden tears in his eyes 
 
 the hallows the hallows murmured dumbledore a desperate mans dream 
 
 but theyre real 
 
 real and dangerous and a lure for fools said dumbledore and i was such a fool but you know dont you i have no secrets from you anymore you know 
 
 what do i know 
 
 dumbledore turned his whole body to face harry and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes 
 
 master of death harry master of death was i better ultimately than voldemort 
 
 of course you were said harry of course c how can you ask that you never killed if you could avoid it 
 
 true true said dumbledore and he was like a child seeking reassurance yet i too sought a way to conquer death harry 
 
 not the way he did said harry after all his anger at dumbledore how odd it was to sit here beneath the high vaulted ceiling and defend dumbledore from himself hallows not horcruxes 
 
 hallows murmured dumbledore not horcruxes precisely 
 
 there was a pause the creature behind them whimpered but harry no longer looked around 
 
 grindelwald was looking for them too he asked 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded 
 
 it was the thing above all that drew us together he said quietly two clever arrogant boys with a shared obsession he wanted to come to godrics hollow as i am sure you have guessed because of the grave of ignotus peverell he wanted to explore the place the third brother had died 
 
 so its true asked harry all of it the peverell brothers c 
 
 c were the three brothers of the tale said dumbledore nodding oh yes i think so whether they met death on a lonely road i think it more likely that the peverell brothers were simply gifted dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects the story of them being deaths own hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations 
 
 the cloak as you know now traveled down through the ages father to son mother to daughter right down to ignotuss last living descendant who was born as ignotus was in the village of godrics hollow 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry 
 
 me 
 
 you you have guessed i know why the cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died james had showed it to me just a few days previously it explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school i could hardly believe what i was seeing i asked to borrow it to examine it i had long since given up my dream of uniting the hallows but i could not resist could not help taking a closer look it was a cloak the likes of which i had never seen immensely old perfect in every respect and then your father died and i had two hallows at last all to myself 
 
 his tone was unbearably bitter 
 
 the cloak wouldnt have helped them survive though harry said quickly voldemort knew where my mum and dad were the cloak couldnt have made them 
 
 true sighed dumbledore true 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak so he prompted him 
 
 so youd given up looking for the hallows when you saw the cloak 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore faintly it seemed that he forced himself to meet harrys eyes you know what happened you know you cannot despise me more than i despise myself 
 
 but i dont despise you c 
 
 then you should said dumbledore he drew a deep breath you know the secret of my sisters ill health what those muggles did what she became you know how my poor father sought revenge and paid the price died in azkaban you know how my mother gave up her own life to care for ariana 
 
 i resented it harry 
 
 dumbledore stated it baldly coldly he was looking now over the top of harrys head into the distance 
 
 i was gifted i was brilliant i wanted to escape i wanted to shine i wanted glory 
 
 do not misunderstand me he said and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again i loved them i loved my parents i loved my brother and my sister but i was selfish harry more selfish than you who are a remarkably selfless person could possibly imagine 
 
 so that when my mother died and i was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother i returned to my village in anger and bitterness trapped and wasted i thought and then of course he came 
 
 dumbledore looked directly into harrys eyes again 
 
 grindelwald you cannot imagine how his ideas caught me harry inflamed me muggles forced into subservience we wizards triumphant grindelwald and i the glorious young leaders of the revolution 
 
 oh i had a few scruples i assuaged my conscience with empty words it would all be for the greater good and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards did i know in my heart of hearts what gellert grindelwald was i think i did but i closed my eyes if the plans we were making came to fruition all my dreams would come true 
 
 and at the heart of our schemes the deathly hallows how they fascinated him how they fascinated both of us the unbeatable wand the weapon that would lead us to power the resurrection stone c to him though i pretended not to know it it meant an army of inferi to me i confess it meant the return of my parents and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders 
 
 and the cloak somehow we never discussed the cloak much harry both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the cloak the true magic of which of course is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner i thought that if we ever found it it might be useful in hiding ariana but our interest in the cloak was mainly that it completed the trio for the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death which we took to mean invincible 
 
 invincible masters of death grindelwald and dumbledore two months of insanity of cruel dreams and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me 
 
 and then you know what happened reality returned in the form of my rough unlettered and infinitely more admirable brother i did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me i did not want to hear that i could not set forth and seek hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow 
 
 the argument became a fight grindelwald lost control that which i had always sensed in him though i pretended not to now sprang into terrible being and ariana after all my mothers care and caution lay dead upon the floor 
 
 dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him he gripped his arm tightly and dumbledore gradually regained control 
 
 well grindelwald fled as anyone but i could have predicted he vanished with his plans for seizing power and his schemes for muggle torture and his dreams of the deathly hallows dreams in which i had encouraged him and helped him he ran while i was left to bury my sister and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief the price of my shame 
 
 years passed there were rumors about him they said he had procured a wand of immense power i meanwhile was offered the post of minister of magic not once but several times naturally i refused i had learned that i was not to be trusted with power 
 
 but youd have been better much better than fudge or scimgeour burst out harry 
 
 would i asked dumbledore heavily i am not so sure i had proven as a very young man that power was my weakness and my temptation it is a curious thing harry but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wear it well 
 
 i was safer at hogwarts i think i was a good teacher c 
 
 you were the best c 
 
 c you are very kind harry but while i busied myself with the training of young wizards grindelwald was raising an army they say he feared me and perhaps he did but less i think than i feared him 
 
 oh not death said dumbledore in answer to harrys questioning look not what he could do to me magically i knew that we were evenly matched perhaps that i was a shade more skillful it was the truth i feared you see i never knew which of us in that last horrific fight had actually cast the curse that killed my sister you may call me cowardly you would be right harry i dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been i who brought about her death not merely through my arrogance and stupidity but that i actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life 
 
 i think he knew it i think he knew what frightened me i delayed meeting him until finally it would have been too shameful to resist any longer people were dying and he seemed unstoppable and i had to do what i could 
 
 well you know what happened next i won the duel i won the wand 
 
 another silence harry did not ask whether dumbledore had ever found out who struck ariana dead he did not want to know and even less did he want dumbledore to have to tell him at last he knew what dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of erised and why dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over harry 
 
 they sat in silence for a long time and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely disturbed harry anymore 
 
 at last he said grindelwald tried to stop voldemort going after the wand he lied you know pretended he had never had it 
 
 dumbledore nodded looking down at his lap tears still glittering on the crooked nose 
 
 they say he showed remorse in later years alone in his cell at nurmengard i hope that is true i would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done perhaps that lie to voldemort was his attempt to make amends to prevent voldemort from taking the hallow 
 
 or maybe from breaking into your tomb suggested harry and dumbledore dabbed his eyes 
 
 after another short pause harry said you tried to use the resurrection stone 
 
 dumbledore nodded 
 
 when i discovered it after all those years buried in the abandoned home of the gaunts c the hallow i had craved most of all though in my youth i had wanted it for very different reasons c i lost my head harry i quite forgot that i was not a horcrux that the ring was sure to carry a curse i picked it up and i put it on and for a second i imagined that i was about to see ariana and my mother and my father and to tell them how very very sorry i was 
 
 i was such a fool harry after all those years i had learned nothing i was unworthy to unite the deathly hallows i had proved it time and again and here was final proof 
 
 why said harry it was natural you wanted to see them again whats wrong with that 
 
 maybe a man in a million could unite the hallows harry i was fit only to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinary i was fit to own the elder wand and not boast of it and not to kill with it i was permitted to tame and use it because i took it not for gain but to save others from it 
 
 but the cloak i took out of vain curiousity and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you its true owners the stone i would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace rather than enable my as you did you are the worthy possessor of the hallows 
 
 dumbledore patted harrys hand and harry looked up at the old man and smiled he could not help himself how could he remain angry with dumbledore now 
 
 why did you have to make it so difficult 
 
 dumbledores smile was tremulous 
 
 i am afraid i counted on miss granger to slow you up harry i was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart i was scared that if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects you might seize the hallows as i did at the wrong time for the wrong reasons if you laid hands on them i wanted you to possess them safely you are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying 
 
 and voldemort never knew about the hallows 
 
 i do not think so because he did not recognize the resurrection stone he turned into a horcrux but even if he had known about them harry i doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first he would not think that he needed the cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead he fears the dead he does not love 
 
 but you expected him to go after the wand 
 
 i have been sure that he would try ever since your wand beat voldemorts in the graveyard of little hangleton at first he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill once he had kidnapped ollivander however he discovered the existence of the twin cores he thought that explained everything yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours so voldemort instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possessed that he did not naturally set out to find the one wand that they said would beat any other for him the elder wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you he believes that the elder wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible poor severus 
 
 if you planned your death with snape you meant him to end up with the elder wand didnt you 
 
 i admit that was my intention said dumbledore but it did not work as i intended did it 
 
 no said harry that bit didnt work out 
 
 the creature behind them jerked and moaned and harry and dumbledore sate without talking for the longest time yet the realization of what would happen next settled gradually over harry in the long minutes like softly falling snow 
 
 ive got to go back havent i 
 
 that is up to you 
 
 ive got a choice 
 
 oh yes dumbledore smiled at him we are in kings cross you say i think that if you decided not to go back you would be able to lets say board a train 
 
 and where would it take me 
 
 on said dumbledore simply 
 
 silence again 
 
 voldemorts got the elder wand 
 
 true voldemort has the elder wand 
 
 but you want me to go back 
 
 i think said dumbledore that if you choose to return there is a chance that he may be finished for good i cannot promise it but i know this harry that you have less to fear from returning here than he does 
 
 harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair 
 
 do not pity the dead harry pity the living and above all those who live without love by returning you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed fewer families are torn apart if that seems to you a worthy goal they we saw for the present 
 
 harry nodded and sighed leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been but it was warm and light and peaceful here and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss he stood up and dumbledore did the same and they looked for a long moment into each others faces 
 
 tell me one last thing said harry is this real or has this been happening inside my head 
 
 dumbledore beamed at him and his voice sounded loud and strong in harrys ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure 
 
 of course it is happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bird of popular song 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it is the earth wears a snowy garment and looks like 
 marble hewn out of the rock the air is bright and clear the wind 
 is sharp as a sword and the trees stand like branches 
 of white coral or blooming almond twigs and here it is keen as on the 
 lofty alps 
 
 the night is splendid in the gleam of the northern lights and 
 in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars 
 
 but we sit in the warm room by the hot stove and talk about 
 the old times and we listen to this story 
 
 by the open sea was a grave and on the sat at 
 midnight the spirit of the buried hero who had been a king the 
 golden circlet gleamed on his brow his hair fluttered in the wind 
 and he was clad in steel and iron he bent his head mournfully and 
 sighed in deep sorrow as an unquiet spirit might sigh 
 
 and a ship came sailing by presently the sailors lowered the 
 anchor and landed among them was a singer and he approached the 
 royal spirit and said 
 
 why mournest thou and wherefore dost thou suffer thus 
 and the dead man answered 
 
 no one has sung the deeds of my life they are dead and 
 forgotten song doth not carry them forth over the lands nor into the 
 hearts of men therefore i have no rest and no peace 
 
 and he spoke of his works and of his warlike deeds which his 
 contemporaries had known but which had not been sung because there was no singer among his companions 
 
 then the old bard struck the strings of his harp and sang of 
 the youthful courage of the hero of the strength of the man and of 
 the greatness of his good deeds then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight gladly and of good courage the form arose in splendor and in majesty and vanished like the glancing of the northern light nought was to be seen but the green tufy mound with the stones on which no runic record has been graven but at the last sound of the harp there soared over the hill as though he had fluttered from the harp a little bird a 
 charming with ringing voice of the thrush with the 
 moving voice pathos of the human heart with a voice that told of 
 home like the voice that is heard by the bird of passage the 
 soared away over mountain and valley over field and 
 wood he was the bird of popular song who never dies 
 
 we hear his song we hear it now in the room while the white 
 bees are swarming without and the storm clutches the windows the 
 bird sings not alone the requiem of heroes he sings also sweet gentle 
 songs of love so many and so warm of northern fidelity and truth 
 he has stories in words and in tones he has proverbs and snatches of proverbs songs which like runes laid under a dead tongue 
 force him to speak and thus popular song tells of the land of his 
 birth 
 
 in the old heathen days in the times of the vikings the popular speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard 
 
 in the days of knightly castles when the strongest fist held 
 the scales of justice when only might was right and a peasant and 
 a dog were of equal importance where did the bird of song find 
 shelter and protection neither violence nor stupidity gave him a 
 thought 
 
 but in the gabled window of the knightly castle the lady of the 
 castle sat with the parchment roll before her and wrote down the 
 old recollections in song and legend while near her stood the old 
 woman from the wood and the travelling peddler who went wandering through the country as these told their tales there fluttered around them with twittering and song the bird of popular song who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon which his foot may rest 
 
 and now he looks in upon us and sings without are the night and 
 the he lays the runes beneath our tongues and we know the land of our home heaven speaks to us in our native tongue in the voice of the bird of popular song the old remembrances awake the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre and story and song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds and our thoughts so that the evening becomes as a christmas festival 
 
 the chase each other the ice cracks the storm 
 rules without for he has the might he is lord but not the lord of 
 all 
 
 it is winter time the wind is sharp as a sword the 
 chase each other it seems as though it had been snowing 
 for days and weeks and the snow lies like a great mountain over the 
 whole town like a heavy dream of the winter night everything on 
 the earth is hidden away only the golden cross of the church the 
 symbol of faith arises over the snow grave and gleams in the blue 
 air and in the bright sunshine 
 
 and over the buried town fly the birds of heaven the small and 
 the great they twitter and they sing as best they may each bird with 
 his beak 
 
 first comes the band of sparrows they pipe at every trifle in the 
 streets and lanes in the nests and the houses they have stories to 
 tell about the front buildings and the back buildings 
 
 we know the buried town they say everything living in it is 
 piep piep piep 
 
 the black ravens and crows flew on over the white snow 
 
 grub grub they cried something to be got down there 
 something to swallow and most important the opinion of most of them down there and the opinion is 
 the wild swans come flying on whirring pinions and sing of the 
 noble and the great that will still sprout in the hearts of men down 
 in the town which is resting beneath its snowy veil 
 
 no death is there life reigns yonder we hear it on the notes 
 that swell onward like the tones of the church organ which seize us 
 like sounds from the like the songs of ossian like the 
 rushing swoop of the wandering spirits wings what harmony that 
 harmony speaks to our hearts and lifts up our souls it is the bird 
 of popular song whom we hear 
 
 and at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down from the 
 sky there are gaps in the snowy mountains the sun shines into the 
 clefts spring is coming the birds are returning and new races are 
 coming with the same home sounds in their hearts 
 
 hear the story of the year the night of the the 
 heavy dream of the winter night all shall be dissolved all shall 
 rise again in the beauteous notes of the bird of popular song who 
 never dies

 book away of the twilight 
 chapter i 
 
 the lower chamber 
 on the following day at nightfall jean valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the gillenormand house 
 it was basque who received him basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour as though he had received his orders 
 it sometimes happens that one says to a servant you will watch for mr so and so when he arrives 
 basque addressed jean valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him 
 monsieur le baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below 
 i will remain below replied jean valjean 
 basque who was perfectly respectful opened the door of the and said 
 i will go and inform madame 
 the room which jean valjean entered was a damp vaulted room on the ground floor which served as a cellar on occasion which opened on the street was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window 
 this chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the the head brush and the broom the dust rested tranquilly there 
 persecution of the spiders was not organized there 
 a fine web which spread far and wide and was very black and ornamented with dead flies formed a wheel on one of the the room which was small and was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner 
 the wall which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash was scaling off in large flakes 
 at one end there was a painted in black with a narrow shelf 
 a fire was burning there which indicated that jean reply 
 i will remain below had been foreseen 
 two were placed at the two corners of the fireplace between the chairs an old bedside rug which displayed more foundation thread than wool had been spread by way of a carpet 
 the chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window 
 jean valjean was fatigued 
 for days he had neither eaten nor slept he threw himself into one of the 
 basque returned set a lighted candle on the and retired jean valjean his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast perceived neither basque nor the candle 
 all at once he drew himself up with a start 
 cosette was standing beside him 
 he had not seen her enter but he had felt that she was there 
 he turned round 
 he gazed at her 
 she was adorably lovely but what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul 
 well exclaimed cosette father i knew that you were peculiar but i never should have expected this 
 what an idea 
 marius told me that you wish me to receive you here 
 yes it is my wish 
 i expected that reply 
 good 
 i warn you that i am going to make a scene for you 
 let us begin at the beginning 
 embrace me father 
 and she offered him her cheek 
 jean valjean remained motionless 
 you do not stir 
 i take note of it 
 attitude of guilt but never mind i pardon you 
 jesus christ said 
 offer the other cheek 
 here it is 
 and she presented her other cheek 
 jean valjean did not move 
 it seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement 
 this is becoming serious said cosette 
 what have i done to you i declare that i am perplexed 
 you owe me reparation 
 you will dine with us 
 i have dined 
 that is not true 
 i will get m gillenormand to scold you grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers 
 come 
 go upstairs with me to the immediately 
 impossible 
 here cosette lost ground a little 
 she ceased to command and passed to questioning 
 but why and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me 
 horrible here 
 thou knowest 
 jean valjean caught himself up 
 you know madame that i am peculiar i have my freaks 
 cosette struck her tiny hands together 
 madame you know more novelties 
 what is the meaning of this 
 jean valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse 
 you wished to be madame 
 you are so 
 not for you father 
 do not call me father 
 what 
 call me monsieur jean 
 jean if you like 
 you are no longer my father 
 i am no longer cosette monsieur jean what does this mean why these are revolutions they what has taken place come look me in the face and you live with us 
 and you have my chamber what have i done to you 
 has anything happened 
 nothing 
 well then 
 everything is as usual 
 why do you change your name 
 you have changed yours surely 
 he smiled again with the same smile as before and added 
 since you are madame pontmercy i certainly can be monsieur jean 
 i understand anything about it 
 all this is idiotic i shall ask permission of my husband for you to be monsieur jean i hope that he will not consent to it 
 you cause me a great deal of pain 
 one does have freaks but one does not cause little cosette grief 
 that is wrong 
 you have no right to be wicked you who are so good 
 he made no reply 
 she seized his hands with vivacity and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin which is a gesture of profound tenderness 
 oh she said to him be good 
 and she went on 
 this is what i call being good 
 being nice and coming and living here there are birds here as there are in the rue with us quitting that hole of a rue de arme not giving us riddles to guess being like all the rest of the world dining with us breakfasting with us being my father 
 he loosed her hands 
 you no longer need a father you have a husband 
 cosette became angry 
 i no longer need a father 
 one really does not know what to say to things like that which are not common sense 
 if toussaint were here resumed jean valjean like a person who is driven to seek authorities and who clutches at every branch she would be the first to agree that it is true that i have always had ways of my own 
 there is nothing new in this 
 i always have loved my black corner 
 but it is cold here 
 one cannot see distinctly 
 it is abominable that it is to wish to be monsieur jean 
 i will not have you say you to me 
 just now as i was coming hither replied jean valjean i saw a piece of furniture in the rue saint louis 
 it was at a if i were a pretty woman i would treat myself to that bit of furniture 
 a very neat toilet table in the reigning style 
 what you call rosewood i think 
 it is inlaid the mirror is quite large 
 there are drawers 
 it is pretty 
 hou the villainous bear replied cosette 
 and with supreme grace setting her teeth and drawing back her lips she blew at jean valjean 
 she was a grace copying a cat 
 i am furious she resumed 
 ever since yesterday you have made me rage all of you 
 i am greatly vexed 
 i understand 
 you do not defend me against marius 
 marius will not uphold me against you i am all alone 
 i arrange a chamber prettily 
 if i could have put the good god there i would have done it 
 my chamber is left on my hands my lodger sends me into bankruptcy 
 i order a nice little dinner of nicolette 
 we will have nothing to do with your dinner madame and my father fauchelevent wants me to call him monsieur jean and to receive him in a frightful old ugly cellar where the walls have beards and where the crystal consists of empty bottles and the curtains are of spiders webs 
 you are singular i admit that is your style but people who get married are granted a truce you ought not to have begun being singular again instantly so you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable rue de arme 
 i was very desperate indeed there that i was what have you against me 
 you cause me a great deal of grief fi 
 and becoming suddenly serious she gazed intently at jean valjean and added 
 are you angry with me because i am happy 
 ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep 
 this question which was simple for cosette was profound for jean valjean cosette had meant to scratch and she lacerated 
 jean valjean turned pale 
 he remained for a moment without replying then with an inexpressible intonation and speaking to himself he murmured 
 her happiness was the object of my life 
 now god may sign my dismissal 
 cosette thou art happy my day is over 
 ah you have said thou to me exclaimed cosette 
 and she sprang to his neck 
 jean valjean in bewilderment strained her wildly to his breast it almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back 
 thanks father said cosette 
 this enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for jean valjean 
 he gently removed arms and took his hat 
 well said cosette 
 i leave you madame they are waiting for you 
 and from the threshold he added 
 i have said thou to you 
 tell your husband that this shall not happen again 
 pardon me 
 jean valjean quitted the room leaving cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell

 second epilogue 
 chapter vii 
 
 when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many people some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it 
 men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power in their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity 
 when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity is given to directing and commanding take less less part in the direct work 
 when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his present activity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and surmises concerning their collective activity 
 for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness of england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day 
 these justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clear moral responsibilities from their path 
 without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event how is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war commit murder and so on 
 with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men 
 in whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion 
 only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving 
 we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters that is the inevitable condition of all that occurs the continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses 
 when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement 
 whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the movement also 
 examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it but as soon as an event occurs be it what it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events 
 arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history 
 what is power 
 what force produces the movement of the nations 
 power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and justifications of the collective action that is performed the less is his participation in that action 
 the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa 
 morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two 
 or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining 
 in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit to which in every domain of thought reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another 
 speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other words that it is a law

 another step backwards 
 on the following day at the same hour jean valjean came 
 cosette asked him no questions was no longer astonished no longer exclaimed that she was cold no longer spoke of the she avoided saying either father or monsieur jean 
 she allowed herself to be addressed as you 
 she allowed herself to be called madame 
 only her joy had undergone a certain diminution she would have been sad if sadness had been possible to her 
 it is probable that she had had with marius one of those conversations in which the beloved man says what he pleases explains nothing and satisfies the beloved woman 
 the curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own love 
 the lower room had made a little toilet 
 basque had suppressed the bottles and nicolette the spiders 
 all the days which followed brought jean valjean at the same hour he came every day because he had not the strength to take marius words otherwise than literally 
 marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when jean valjean came 
 the house grew accustomed to the novel ways of m fauchelevent 
 toussaint helped in this direction 
 monsieur has always been like that she repeated the grandfather issued this an original 
 and all was said 
 moreover at the age of no bond is any longer possible all is merely juxtaposition a newcomer is in the way there is no longer any room all habits are acquired 
 m fauchelevent m tranchelevent father gillenormand asked nothing better than to be relieved from that gentleman 
 he is more common than those originals 
 they do all sorts of queer things they have no reason 
 the marquis de canaples was still worse he bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret 
 these are fantastic appearances that people affect 
 no one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation 
 and moreover who could have guessed such a thing 
 there are marshes of this description in india 
 the water seems extraordinary inexplicable rippling though there is no wind and agitated where it should be calm 
 one gazes at the surface of these causeless ebullitions one does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom 
 many men have a secret monster in this same manner a dragon which gnaws them a despair which inhabits their night 
 such a man resembles other men he goes and comes 
 no one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth which lives within the unhappy man and of which he is dying no one knows that this man is a gulf 
 he is stagnant but deep from time to time a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface 
 a mysterious wrinkle is formed then vanishes then an rises and bursts it is the breathing of the unknown beast 
 certain strange habits 
 arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the mantle seeking the solitary walk preferring the deserted street avoiding any share in conversation avoiding crowds and festivals seeming at ease and living poorly having key in pocket and candle at the lodge however rich one may be entering by the side door ascending the private these insignificant singularities fugitive folds on the surface often proceed from a formidable foundation 
 many weeks passed in this manner 
 a new life gradually took possession of cosette 
 the relations which marriage creates visits the care of the house pleasures great matters 
 pleasures were not costly they consisted in one thing 
 being with marius 
 the great occupation of her life was to go out with him to remain with him it was for them a joy that was always fresh to go out arm in arm in the face of the sun in the open street without hiding themselves before the whole world both of them completely alone 
 cosette had one vexation 
 toussaint could not get on with nicolette the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible and she went away the grandfather was well marius argued a case here and there aunt gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her beside the new household 
 jean valjean came every day 
 the address as thou disappeared the you the madame the monsieur jean rendered him another person to cosette 
 the care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding she became more and more gay and less and less tender 
 yet she still loved him sincerely and he felt it 
 one day she said to him suddenly 
 you used to be my father you are no longer my father you were my uncle you are no longer my uncle you were monsieur fauchelevent you are jean 
 who are you then i like all this 
 if i did not know how good you are i should be afraid of you 
 he still lived in the rue de arme because he could not make up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where cosette dwelt 
 at first he only remained a few minutes with cosette and then went away 
 little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief one would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of the days which were lengthening he arrived earlier and departed later 
 one day cosette chanced to say father to him 
 a flash of joy illuminated jean melancholy old countenance he caught her up 
 say truly she replied with a burst of laughter monsieur is right said he and he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes

 second epilogue 
 chapter viii 
 
 if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument but the law of history relates to man a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law 
 the presence of the problem of free will though unexpressed is felt at every step of history 
 all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question 
 if the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as he pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents 
 if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely that is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity 
 if there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannot exist for then will is subject to that law 
 in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance 
 the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view theological historical ethical or philosophic we find a general law of necessity to which he like all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free 
 this consciousness is a source of quite apart from and independent of reason through his reason man observes himself but only through consciousness does he know himself 
 apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable 
 to understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all be conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of his volition but his will which forms the essence of his life man recognizes and can but recognize as free 
 if observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food using his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were it not free it could not be limited a will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free 
 you say i am not and am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it fall everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom 
 that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason 
 if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of it would be subject to reasoning and to experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable 
 a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as an object of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them but the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends on his organization his character and the motives acting upon him yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled 
 but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he does not and cannot believe this 
 however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases every man savage or sage however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions feels that without this irrational conception which constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feels that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would be unable to live for a single moment 
 he could not live because all efforts all his impulses to life are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom 
 a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life 
 if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason 
 this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by experiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question 
 man is the creation of an and god what is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for theology 
 the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics what is responsibility to society the conception of which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for jurisprudence 
 actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for ethics 
 man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life but the same man apart from that connection appears to free how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded as the result of the free or as the result of the constrained activity of man that is a question for history 
 only in our day of the popularization of knowledge thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of printed matter has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the majority of advanced people that is the crowd of ignoramuses have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem 
 they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has never been denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it for the fact that from the point of view of observation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a breadth the solution of the question which has another opposite side based on the consciousness of freedom 
 if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is the time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we can observe only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity 
 the naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve this question are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is now so smooth and regular

 chapter iii 
 
 they recall the garden of the rue plumet 
 this was the last time 
 after that last flash of light complete extinction ensued 
 no more familiarity no more with a kiss never more that word so profoundly sweet 
 my father he was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other and he had this sorrow that after having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail 
 the eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar in short it sufficed for him to have an apparition of cosette every day 
 his whole life was concentrated in that one hour 
 he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked to her of years gone by of her childhood of the convent of her little friends of those bygone days 
 one was on one of those early days in april already warm and fresh the moment of the great gayety the gardens which surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking the hawthorn was on the point of budding a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies and buttercups the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance the wind that minstrel of the eternal wedding was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand auroral symphony which the old poets called the said to said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the rue plumet let us go thither 
 we must not be away they flitted like two swallows towards the spring 
 this garden of the rue plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn 
 they already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love 
 the house in the rue plumet being held on a lease still belonged to cosette 
 they went to that garden and that house there they found themselves again there they forgot themselves that evening at the usual hour jean valjean came to the rue des went out with monsieur and has not yet returned basque said to him 
 he seated himself in silence and waited an hour 
 cosette did not return 
 he departed with drooping head 
 cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to their garden and so joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of nothing else on the morrow 
 she did not notice that she had not seen jean valjean 
 in what way did you go thither 
 jean valjean asked her 
 on foot 
 and how did you return 
 in a hackney carriage 
 for some time jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people 
 he was troubled by it 
 marius economy was severe and that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean he hazarded a query 
 why do you not have a carriage of your own 
 a pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month 
 you are rich 
 i know replied cosette 
 it is like toussaint resumed jean valjean 
 she is gone you have not replaced her 
 why 
 nicolette suffices 
 but you ought to have a maid 
 have i not marius 
 you ought to have a house of your own your own servants a carriage a box at the theatre 
 there is nothing too fine for you why not profit by your riches 
 wealth adds to happiness 
 cosette made no reply 
 jean visits were not abridged 
 far from it 
 when it is the heart which is slipping one does not halt on the downward slope 
 when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good 
 cosette outdid him jean valjean began again 
 they were never weary 
 word was inexhaustible those six letters contained volumes in this manner jean valjean contrived to remain a long time 
 it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side 
 it alleviated his wounds 
 it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce m gillenormand sends me to remind madame la baronne that dinner is served 
 on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home 
 was there then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of marius 
 was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly 
 one day he remained still longer than usual 
 on the following day he observed that there was no fire on the he thought no he furnished the explanation for is perfectly simple 
 it is april 
 the cold weather has ceased 
 heavens how cold it is here exclaimed cosette when she entered 
 why no said jean valjean 
 was it you who told basque not to make a fire then 
 yes since we are now in the month of may 
 but we have a fire until june 
 one is needed all the year in this cellar 
 i thought that a fire was unnecessary 
 that is exactly like one of your ideas retorted cosette 
 on the following day there was a fire 
 but the two were arranged at the other end of the room near the door what is the meaning of this thought jean valjean 
 he went for the and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth 
 this fire lighted once more encouraged him however 
 he prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits 
 as he rose to take his leave cosette said to him 
 my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday 
 what was it 
 he said to me 
 cosette we have an income of thirty thousand livres that you own and three that my grandfather gives me 
 i replied 
 that makes thirty 
 he went on would you have the courage to live on the three thousand i answered 
 yes on nothing 
 provided that it was with you and then i asked 
 why do you say that to me 
 he replied i wanted to know 
 jean valjean found not a word to answer 
 cosette probably expected some explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence he went back to the rue de arme he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining dwelling 
 it was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again 
 his mind was swarming with conjectures 
 it was evident that marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that he feared some source that was not pure who knows that he had even perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune and was disinclined to take it as his that both he and cosette should remain poor rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean 
 moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door 
 on the following day he underwent something like a shock on entering the room 
 the had disappeared there was not a single chair of any sort 
 ah this exclaimed cosette as she entered no chairs where are the 
 they are no longer here replied jean valjean 
 this is too much 
 jean valjean stammered 
 it was i who told basque to remove them 
 and your reason 
 i have only a few minutes to stay 
 a brief stay is no reason for remaining standing 
 i think that basque needed the chairs for the 
 why 
 you have company this evening no doubt 
 we expect no one 
 jean valjean had not another word to say 
 cosette shrugged her shoulders 
 to have the chairs carried off 
 the other day you had the fire put out 
 how odd you are 
 adieu murmured jean valjean 
 he did not say 
 adieu cosette 
 but he had not the strength to say adieu madame 
 he went away utterly overwhelmed 
 this time he had understood 
 on the following day he did not come 
 cosette only observed the fact in the evening 
 why said she monsieur jean has not been here today 
 and she felt a slight twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius 
 on the following day he did not come 
 cosette paid no heed to this passed her evening and slept well that night as usual and thought of it only when she woke she was so happy 
 she speedily despatched nicolette to m house to inquire whether he were ill and why he had not come on the previous evening 
 nicolette brought back the reply of m jean that he was not ill 
 he was busy 
 he would come soon as soon as he was able 
 moreover he was on the point of taking a little journey 
 madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time 
 they were not to worry about him they were not to think of him 
 nicolette on entering m had repeated to him her mistress very words 
 that madame had sent her to inquire why m jean bad not come on the preceding is two days since i have been there said jean valjean gently 
 but the remark passed unnoticed by nicolette who did not report it to cosette

 second epilogue 
 chapter ix 
 
 for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with that for history this question does not refer to the essence of free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions 
 in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science 
 the subject for history is not will itself but our presentation of it 
 and so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation of life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place 
 in actual life each historic event each human action is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory 
 to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements 
 whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider we always regard it as the result partly of free will and partly of the law of inevitability 
 whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us 
 our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive and the more inevitability the less freedom 
 the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but their relation is always one of inverse proportion 
 a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man seem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law of necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every action of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased according to the point of view from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa 
 religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom 
 all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations 
 the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds 
 his relation to time 
 his relation to the causes leading to the action 
 the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of one bound by family official or business duties seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion 
 if we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything around him each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to anything around him if we see his connection with anything whatever with a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he is engaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases 
 the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man resulting in the production of the human race appear evidently less free than a entry into marriage today it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me 
 the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it 
 if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedly free but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being in different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it good agreeable and even essential would not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed the farther i go back in memory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action 
 in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear 
 the war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter head today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on caprice the farther back in history the object of our observation lies the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability 
 the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each phenomenon comprehended and therefore every action must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow 
 the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear 
 when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a crime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality originality and independence but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedom of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates his fault in our eyes the of a father or mother or with the possibility of a reward is more comprehensible than gratuitous and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a sect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range of examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in actions their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation our conception of their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company a relapse into drunkenness and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development like a child a madman or a simpleton then knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result 
 on these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action

 attraction and extinction 
 during the last months of spring and the first months of summer in the rare passersby in the marais the petty shopkeepers the loungers on thresholds noticed an old man neatly clad in black who emerged every day at the same hour towards nightfall from the rue de arme on the side of the rue passed in front of the blancs manteaux gained the rue and on arriving at the rue de turned to the left and entered the rue 
 there he walked at a slow pace with his head strained forward seeing nothing hearing nothing his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him which never varied and which was no other than the corner of the rue des the nearer he approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora he had a fascinated and much affected air his lips indulged in obscure movements as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible one would have said that while desirous of reaching his destination he feared the moment when he should be close at hand 
 when only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened to such a degree that at times one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all the vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole whatever time he spent on arriving he was obliged to arrive at last he reached the rue des then he halted he trembled he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house and gazed into that street and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him 
 then a tear which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids and had become large enough to fall trickled down his cheek and sometimes stopped at his mouth the old man tasted its bitter flavor 
 thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone then he returned by the same road and with the same step and in proportion as he retreated his glance died out 
 little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the rue des he halted half way in the rue sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer 
 one day he stopped at the corner of the rue and looked at the rue des from a distance then he shook his head slowly from right to left as though refusing himself something and retraced his steps 
 soon he no longer came as far as the rue he got as far as the rue pavee shook his head and turned back then he went no further than the rue des then he did not overstep the one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether 
 every day he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the same trip but he no longer completed it and perhaps without himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it his whole countenance expressed this single idea 
 what is the use his eye was dim no more radiance 
 his tears were also exhausted they no longer collected in the corner of his that thoughtful eye was dry 
 the old head was still craned forward his chin moved at times the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold sometimes when the weather was bad he had an umbrella under his arm but he never opened it 
 the good women of the quarter said 
 he is an innocent the children followed him and laughed

 second epilogue 
 chapter x 
 
 thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a life 
 so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known where the time between the action and its examination is great and where the causes of the action are most accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on external conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom 
 in neither case however we may change our point of view however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short the period of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity 
 to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seems to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which is evidently impossible 
 however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me the moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at that moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i made would be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine it in the present on the boundary between the past and the future that is outside time which is impossible 
 however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action our own or the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action 
 but even if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences examining only his momentary action in the present unevoked by any cause we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a man 
 in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability 
 however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains 
 however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while time is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability 
 however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again we never reach absolute inevitability 
 but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero we assumed in some given case as for instance in that of a dying man an unborn babe or an idiot complete absence of freedom by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a completely free action 
 and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time and an infinite series of causes 
 to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time and free from dependence on cause 
 in the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself that is a mere form without content 
 in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time and cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing or mere content without form 
 we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which whole outlook on the universe is constructed the incomprehensible essence of life and the laws defining that essence 
 reason says space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end 
 consciousness says i alone am and all that exists is but me consequently i include space i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living consequently i am outside time i am beyond cause for i feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life 
 reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom 
 freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in consciousness inevitability without content is reason in its three forms 
 freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom is the content inevitability is the form 
 only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another as form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability 
 only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of life 
 apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content no conception of life is possible 
 all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason 
 all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence of life to the laws of reason 
 the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom 
 but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight up to law so too the force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws 
 all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason 
 free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason just so the force of free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from gravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reason it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life 
 and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or of chemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content of astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics 
 in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life 
 so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability what is unknown we call free will free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life

 pity for the unhappy but indulgence for the happy 
 it is a terrible thing to be happy 
 how content one is 
 how one finds it 
 how being in possession of the false object of life happiness one forgets the true object duty 
 let us say however that the reader would do wrong were he to blame marius 
 marius as we have explained before his marriage had put no questions to m fauchelevent and since that time he had feared to put any to jean valjean 
 he had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn 
 he had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair 
 he had confined himself to gradually estranging jean valjean from his house and to effacing him as much as possible from mind 
 he had in a manner always placed himself between cosette and jean valjean sure that in this way she would not perceive nor think of the latter 
 it was more than effacement it was an eclipse 
 marius did what he considered necessary and just 
 he thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen and others which will be seen later on for getting rid of jean valjean without harshness but without weakness 
 chance having ordained that he should encounter in a case which he had argued a former employee of the laffitte establishment he had acquired mysterious information without seeking it which he had not been able it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard and out of consideration for jean perilous position 
 he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform 
 the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion 
 in the meanwhile he abstained from touching that money 
 as for cosette she had not been initiated into any of these secrets but it would be harsh to condemn her also 
 there existed between marius and her an magnetism which caused her to do instinctively and almost mechanically what marius wished 
 she was conscious of marius will in the direction of monsieur jean she conformed to it 
 her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions and obeyed blindly 
 her obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what marius forgot 
 she was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this 
 without her knowing why herself and without his having any cause to accuse her of it her soul had become so wholly her that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius mind became overcast in hers 
 let us not go too far however in what concerns jean valjean this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial 
 she was rather heedless than forgetful 
 at bottom she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father but she loved her husband still more dearly 
 this was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart which leaned to one side only 
 it sometimes happened that cosette spoke of jean valjean and expressed her surprise 
 then marius calmed her 
 he is absent i think 
 did not he say that he was setting out on a is true thought cosette 
 he had a habit of disappearing in this fashion 
 but not for so long 
 two or three times she despatched nicolette to inquire in the rue de arme whether m jean had returned from his journey 
 jean valjean caused the answer no to be given 
 cosette asked nothing more since she had but one need on earth marius 
 let us also say that on their side cosette and marius had also been absent 
 they had been to vernon 
 marius had taken cosette to his grave 
 marius gradually won cosette away from jean valjean 
 cosette allowed it 
 moreover that which is called far too harshly in certain cases the ingratitude of children is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed 
 it is the ingratitude of nature 
 nature as we have elsewhere said looks before her 
 nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing 
 those who are departing are turned towards the shadows those who are arriving towards the light 
 hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old and involuntary on the part of the young 
 this breach at first insensible increases slowly like all separations of branches 
 the boughs without becoming detached from the trunk grow away from it 
 it is no fault of theirs 
 youth goes where there is joy festivals vivid lights love 
 old age goes towards the end 
 they do not lose sight of each other but there is no longer a close connection 
 young people feel the cooling off of life old people that of the tomb 
 let us not blame these poor children

 second epilogue 
 chapter xi 
 
 history examines the manifestations of free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is it defines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws 
 the recognition of free will as something capable of influencing historical events that is as not subject to laws is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy 
 that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving freely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if any single action is due to free will then not a single historical law can exist nor any conception of historical events 
 for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of will in the present moves in space time and dependence on cause 
 the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those laws is the problem of history 
 from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events in freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible for however free will may be restricted as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes impossible 
 only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and then instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as its problem 
 the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the toward which ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena the old method of history is moving 
 all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all unknown infinitely small elements 
 in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done by the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for laws history stands on the same path and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting aside the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will

 last flickerings of a lamp without oil 
 one day jean valjean descended his staircase took three steps in the street seated himself on a post on that same stone post where gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the th and the th of june he remained there a few moments then went up stairs again 
 this was the last oscillation of the pendulum 
 on the following day he did not leave his apartment 
 on the day after that he did not leave his bed 
 his portress who prepared his scanty repasts a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed 
 but you ate nothing yesterday poor dear man 
 certainly i did replied jean valjean 
 the plate is quite full 
 look at the water jug 
 it is empty 
 that proves that you have drunk it does not prove that you have eaten 
 well said jean valjean what if i felt hungry only for water 
 that is called thirst and when one does not eat at the same time it is called fever 
 i will eat 
 or at trinity day 
 why not is it the thing to say 
 i will eat the idea of leaving my platter without even touching it 
 my ladyfinger potatoes were so good 
 jean valjean took the old hand 
 i promise you that i will eat them he said in his benevolent voice 
 i am not pleased with you replied the portress 
 jean valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman 
 there are streets in paris through which no one ever passes and houses to which no one ever comes 
 he was in one of those streets and one of those houses 
 while he still went out he had purchased of a coppersmith for a few sous a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed 
 that gibbet is always good to look at 
 a week passed and jean valjean had not taken a step in his room 
 he still remained in bed 
 the portress said to her good man upstairs yonder does not get up he no longer eats he will not last long 
 that man has his sorrows that he has 
 you get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage 
 the porter replied with the tone of marital sovereignty 
 if rich let him have a doctor 
 if he is not rich let him go without 
 if he has no doctor he will die 
 and if he has one 
 he will die said the porter 
 the portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement with an old knife and as she tore out the blades she grumbled 
 a shame 
 such a neat old man 
 as white as a chicken 
 she caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the street she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs 
 on the second floor said she 
 you have only to enter 
 as the good man no longer stirs from his bed the door is always unlocked 
 the doctor saw jean valjean and spoke with him 
 when he came down again the portress interrogated him 
 well doctor 
 your sick man is very ill indeed 
 what is the matter with him 
 everything and nothing 
 he is a man who to all appearances has lost some person who is dear to him 
 people die of that 
 what did he say to you 
 he told me that he was in good health 
 shall you come again doctor 
 yes replied the doctor 
 but some one else besides must come

 second epilogue 
 chapter xii 
 
 from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seem impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after the discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time 
 from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence 
 by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of free will for if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic ethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause 
 and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics geography political economy comparative philology and geology which directly contradict its assumptions 
 the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation but when truth conquered theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation 
 just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subverting revelation 
 in the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the other is the passion for destruction 
 to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua the son of nun to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton to voltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion 
 just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and evil and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions 
 so too like voltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion though the law of inevitability in history like the law of copernicus in astronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected 
 as in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history now the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visible phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in history it is the independence of personality free will 
 as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the fixity and of the motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of own personality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do not feel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it is true that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence on the external world on time and on cause we arrive at laws 
 in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious

 a pen is heavy to the man who lifted the cart 
 one evening jean valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse his breath was short and halted at times he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before 
 then no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation he made an effort drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself 
 he put on his old clothes 
 as he no longer went out he had returned to them and preferred them 
 he was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead 
 since he had been alone he had placed his bed in the antechamber in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible 
 he opened the valise and drew from it outfit 
 he spread it out on his bed 
 the candlesticks were in their place on the he took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks 
 then although it was still broad was summer he lighted them 
 in the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse 
 every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him and he was obliged to sit down 
 it was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it it was the remnant of all movement possible to him it was life drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed 
 the chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirror so fatal for him so providential for marius in which he had read reversed writing on the blotting book 
 he caught sight of himself in this mirror and did not recognize himself 
 he was eighty years old before marius marriage he would have hardly been taken for fifty that year had counted for thirty 
 what he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age it was the mysterious mark of death 
 the hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there 
 his cheeks were pendulous the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs 
 he gazed into space with an air of reproach one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some one 
 he was in that condition the last phase of dejection in which sorrow no longer flows it is coagulated so to speak there is something on the soul like a clot of despair 
 night had come 
 he laboriously dragged a table and the old to the fireside and placed upon the table a pen some ink and some paper 
 that done he had a fainting fit 
 when he recovered consciousness he was thirsty 
 as he could not lift the jug he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth and swallowed a draught 
 as neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time the point of the pen had curled up the ink had dried away he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink which he did not accomplish without pausing and sitting down two or three times and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen 
 he wiped his brow from time to time 
 then he turned towards the bed and still seated for he could not stand he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects 
 these contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes 
 all at once he shivered he felt that a child was taking possession of him he rested his elbows on the table which was illuminated by the candles and took up the pen 
 his hand trembled 
 he wrote slowly the few following lines 
 cosette i bless thee 
 i am going to explain to thee 
 thy husband was right in giving me to understand that i ought to go away but there is a little error in what he believed though he was in the right 
 he is excellent 
 love him well even after i am dead 
 monsieur pontmercy love my darling child well 
 cosette this paper will be found this is what i wish to say to thee thou wilt see the figures if i have the strength to recall them listen well this money is really thine 
 here is the whole matter 
 white jet comes from norway black jet comes from england black glass jewellery comes from germany 
 jet is the lightest the most precious the most costly 
 imitations can be made in france as well as in germany 
 what is needed is a little anvil two inches square and a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax 
 the wax was formerly made with resin and lampblack and cost four livres the pound 
 i invented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine 
 it does not cost more than thirty sous and is much better 
 buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast by means of this wax to a little framework of black iron 
 the glass must be violet for iron jewellery and black for gold jewellery 
 spain buys a great deal of it 
 it is the country of jet 
 here he paused the pen fell from his fingers he was seized by one of those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being the poor man clasped his head in both hands and meditated 
 oh he exclaimed within himself lamentable cries heard by god alone all is over 
 i shall never see her more 
 she is a smile which passed over me 
 i am about to plunge into the night without even seeing her again 
 oh one minute one instant to hear her voice to touch her dress to gaze upon her upon her the angel and then to die 
 it is nothing to die what is frightful is to die without seeing her 
 she would smile on me she would say a word to me would that do any harm to any one 
 no all is over and forever 
 here i am all alone 
 my god 
 my god 
 i shall never see her again 
 at that moment there came a knock at the door

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter iv 
 
 a bottle of ink which only succeeded in whitening 
 that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius left the table and was on the point of withdrawing to his study having a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying 
 the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber 
 cosette had taken the arm and was strolling in the garden 
 a letter like a man may have an unprepossessing exterior 
 coarse paper coarsely very sight of certain missives is displeasing 
 the letter which basque had brought was of this sort 
 marius took it 
 it smelled of tobacco 
 nothing evokes a memory like an odor 
 marius recognized that tobacco 
 he looked at the superscription 
 to monsieur monsieur le baron pommerci 
 at his hotel 
 the recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well 
 it may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes 
 marius was as it were illuminated by one of these flashes 
 the sense of smell that mysterious aid to memory had just revived a whole world within him 
 this was certainly the paper the fashion of folding the dull tint of ink it was certainly the handwriting especially was it the same tobacco 
 the jondrette garret rose before his mind 
 thus strange freak of chance one of the two scents which he had so diligently sought the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost had come and presented itself to him of its own accord 
 he eagerly broke the seal and read 
 monsieur le the supreme being had given me the talents i might have been baron thenard member of the institute academy of ciences but i am not 
 i only bear the same as him happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses 
 the benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle 
 i am in possession of a secret concerning an individual 
 this individual concerns you 
 i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you 
 i will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there madame la baronne being of lofty birth 
 the sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer with crime without abdicating 
 i awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron 
 with respect 
 the letter was signed thenard 
 this signature was not false 
 it was merely a trifle abridged 
 moreover the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation 
 the certificate of origin was complete 
 marius emotion was profound 
 after a start of surprise he underwent a feeling of happiness 
 if he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search the man who had saved him marius there would be nothing left for him to desire 
 he opened the drawer of his secretary took out several put them in his pocket closed the secretary again and rang the bell 
 basque half opened the door 
 show the man in said marius 
 basque announced 
 monsieur thenard 
 a man entered 
 a fresh surprise for marius 
 the man who entered was an utter stranger to him 
 this man who was old moreover had a thick nose his chin swathed in a cravat green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of english coachmen in high life 
 his hair was gray 
 he was dressed in black from head to foot in garments that were very threadbare but clean a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch 
 he held in his hand an old hat 
 he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow 
 the first thing that struck the observer was that this coat which was too ample although carefully buttoned had not been made for him 
 here a short digression becomes necessary 
 there was in paris at that epoch in a old lodging in the rue beautreillis near the arsenal an ingenious jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men 
 not for too long which might have proved embarrassing for the villain 
 the change was on sight for a day or two at the rate of thirty sous a day by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible 
 this costumer was called the changer the pickpockets of paris had given him this name and knew him by no other 
 he had a tolerably complete wardrobe 
 the rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable 
 he had specialties and categories on each nail of his shop hung a social status threadbare and worn here the suit of a magistrate there the outfit of a cure beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a statesman 
 this creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in paris 
 his lair was the whence theft emerged and into which roguery retreated 
 a tattered knave arrived at this deposited his thirty sous and selected according to the part which he wished to play the costume which suited him and on descending the stairs once more the knave was a somebody 
 on the following day the clothes were faithfully returned and the changer who trusted the thieves with everything was never robbed 
 there was one inconvenience about these clothes they did not fit not having been made for those who wore them they were too tight for one too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one 
 every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the costumes 
 it was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean 
 the changer had foreseen only ordinary men 
 he had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand who is neither stout nor thin neither tall nor short 
 hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the clients extricated themselves as best they might 
 so much the worse for the exceptions 
 the suit of the statesman for instance black from head to foot and consequently proper would have been too large for pitt and too small for castelcicala 
 the costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the catalogue we copy 
 a coat of black cloth trowsers of black wool a silk waistcoat boots and linen 
 on the margin there stood 
 and a note which we also copy 
 in a separate box a neatly frizzed peruke green glasses seals and two small quills an inch long wrapped in cotton 
 all this belonged to the statesman the this whole costume was if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were white a vague yawned at one of the elbows moreover one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart its function was to conceal the absent button 
 if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom basque had just shown in the suit borrowed from the shop of the changer 
 marius disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the disadvantage 
 he surveyed him from head to foot while that personage made exaggerated bows and demanded in a curt tone 
 what do you want 
 the man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea 
 it seems to me impossible that i should not have already had the honor of seeing monsieur le baron in society 
 i think i actually did meet monsieur personally several years ago at the house of madame la princesse bagration and in the of his lordship the vicomte dambray peer of france 
 it is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know 
 marius paid attention to the manner of this speech 
 he spied on his accent and gesture but his disappointment increased the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry shrill tone which he had expected 
 he was utterly routed 
 i know neither madame bagration nor m dambray said he 
 i have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life 
 the reply was ungracious 
 the personage determined to be gracious at any cost insisted 
 then it must have been at that i have seen monsieur 
 i know chateaubriand very well 
 he is very affable 
 he sometimes says to me 
 thenard my friend you drink a glass of wine with me 
 marius brow grew more and more severe 
 i have never had the honor of being received by m de chateaubriand 
 let us cut it short 
 what do you want 
 the man bowed lower at that harsh voice 
 monsieur le baron deign to listen to me 
 there is in america in a district near panama a village called la joya 
 that village is composed of a single house a large square house of three stories built of bricks dried in the sun each side of the square five hundred feet in length each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept no windows loopholes no doors ladders ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace and from the first to the second and from the second to the third ladders to descend into the inner court no doors to the chambers no staircases to the chambers ladders in the evening the traps are closed the ladders are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes no means of entering a house by day a citadel by night eight hundred inhabitants that is the village 
 why so many precautions because the country is dangerous it is full of cannibals 
 then why do people go there because the country is marvellous gold is found there 
 what are you driving at interrupted marius who had passed from disappointment to impatience 
 at this monsieur le baron 
 i am an old and weary diplomat 
 ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices 
 i want to try savages 
 well 
 monsieur le baron egotism is the law of the world 
 the proletarian peasant woman who toils by the day turns round when the diligence passes by the peasant proprietress who toils in her field does not turn round 
 the dog of the poor man barks at the rich man the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man 
 each one for himself 
 the object of men 
 gold the loadstone 
 what then 
 finish 
 i should like to go and establish myself at la joya 
 there are three of us 
 i have my spouse and my young lady a very beautiful girl 
 the journey is long and costly 
 i need a little money 
 what concern is that of mine demanded marius 
 the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat a gesture characteristic of the vulture and replied with an augmented smile 
 has not monsieur le baron perused my letter 
 there was some truth in this 
 the fact is that the contents of the epistle had slipped marius mind 
 he had seen the writing rather than read the letter 
 he could hardly recall it 
 but a moment ago a fresh start had been given him 
 he had noted that detail 
 my spouse and my young lady 
 he fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger 
 an examining judge could not have done the look better 
 he almost lay in wait for him 
 he confined himself to replying 
 state the case precisely 
 the stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column but scrutinizing marius in his turn with the green gaze of his spectacles 
 so be it monsieur le baron 
 i will be precise 
 i have a secret to sell to you 
 a secret 
 a secret 
 which concerns me 
 somewhat 
 what is the secret 
 marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him 
 i commence gratis said the stranger 
 you will see that i am interesting 
 speak 
 monsieur le baron you have in your house a thief and an assassin 
 marius shuddered 
 in my house no said he 
 the imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on 
 an assassin and a thief 
 remark monsieur le baron that i do not here speak of ancient deeds deeds of the past which have lapsed which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god 
 i speak of recent deeds of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour 
 i continue 
 this man has insinuated himself into your confidence and almost into your family under a false name 
 i am about to tell you his real name 
 and to tell it to you for nothing 
 i am listening 
 his name is jean valjean 
 i know it 
 i am going to tell you equally for nothing who he is 
 say on 
 he is an 
 i know it 
 you know it since i have had the honor of telling you 
 no i knew it before 
 marius cold tone that double reply of i know it his laconicism which was not favorable to dialogue stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger 
 he launched a furious glance on the sly at marius which was instantly extinguished 
 rapid as it was this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it it did not escape marius 
 certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls the eye that of the thought glows with it spectacles hide nothing try putting a pane of glass over hell 
 the stranger resumed with a smile 
 i will not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron 
 in any case you ought to perceive that i am well informed 
 now what i have to tell you is known to myself alone 
 this concerns the fortune of madame la baronne 
 it is an extraordinary secret 
 it is for sale i make you the first offer of it 
 cheap 
 twenty thousand francs 
 i know that secret as well as the others said marius 
 the personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle 
 monsieur le baron say ten thousand francs and i will speak 
 i repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me 
 i know what you wish to say to me 
 a fresh flash gleamed in the eye 
 he exclaimed 
 but i must dine nevertheless 
 it is an extraordinary secret i tell you 
 monsieur le baron i will speak 
 i speak 
 give me twenty francs 
 marius gazed intently at him 
 i know your extraordinary secret just as i knew jean name just as i know your name 
 my name 
 yes 
 that is not difficult monsieur le baron 
 i had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you 
 thenard 
 dier 
 hey 
 thenardier 
 that 
 in danger the porcupine bristles up the beetle feigns death the old guard forms in a square this man burst into laughter 
 then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip 
 marius continued 
 you are also jondrette the workman fabantou the comedian genflot the poet don alvares the spaniard and mistress balizard 
 mistress what 
 and you kept a at montfermeil 
 a never 
 and i tell you that your name is thenardier 
 i deny it 
 and that you are a rascal 
 here 
 and marius drew a from his pocket and flung it in his face 
 thanks 
 pardon me five hundred francs 
 monsieur le baron 
 and the man overcome bowed seized the note and examined it 
 five hundred francs he began again taken aback 
 and he stammered in a low voice 
 an honest rustler 
 un fafiot serieux 
 fafiot is the slang term for a derived from its rustling noise 
 then brusquely 
 well so be it he exclaimed 
 let us put ourselves at our ease 
 and with the agility of a monkey flinging back his hair tearing off his spectacles and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made and which the reader has also met with on another page of this book he took off his face as the man takes off his hat 
 his eye lighted up his uneven brow with hollows in some places and bumps in others hideously wrinkled at the top was laid bare his nose had become as sharp as a beak the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared 
 monsieur le baron is infallible he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared i am thenardier 
 and he straightened up his crooked back

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter iv 
 
 thenardier for it was really he was strangely surprised he would have been troubled had he been capable of such a thing 
 he had come to bring astonishment and it was he who had received it 
 this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he accepted it but he was none the less bewildered 
 he beheld this baron pontmercy for the first time and in spite of his disguise this baron pontmercy recognized him and recognized him thoroughly 
 and not only was this baron perfectly informed as to thenardier but he seemed well posted as to jean valjean 
 who was this almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew names who knew all their names and who opened his purse to them who bullied rascals like a judge and who paid them like a dupe 
 thenardier the reader will remember although he had been marius neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had formerly in a vague way heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named marius who lived in the house 
 he had written to him without knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted 
 no connection between that marius and m le baron pontmercy was possible in his mind 
 as for the name pontmercy it will be recalled that on the battlefield of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks 
 however through his daughter azelma who had started on the scent of the married pair on the th of february and through his own personal researches he had succeeded in learning many things and from the depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew 
 he had discovered by dint of industry or at least by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer 
 from the man he had easily reached the name 
 he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette 
 but he meant to be discreet in that quarter 
 who was cosette 
 he did not know exactly himself 
 he did indeed catch an inkling of illegitimacy the history of fantine had always seemed to him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence 
 he had or thought he had better wares than that for sale 
 and according to all appearances if he were to come and make to the baron pontmercy this without proof 
 your wife is a bastard the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer 
 from point of view the conversation with marius had not yet begun 
 he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs in his pocket 
 moreover he had something decisive to say and even against this very and baron pontmercy he felt himself strong 
 for men of nature every dialogue is a combat 
 in the one in which he was about to engage what was his situation 
 he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner forces and after having said 
 i am thenardier he waited 
 marius had become thoughtful 
 so he had hold of thenardier at last 
 that man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him 
 he could honor colonel recommendation 
 he felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him marius had been protested up to that day 
 it also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards thenardier that there was occasion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal 
 in any case he was content 
 he was about to deliver the shade from this unworthy creditor at last and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his memory from the debtors prison 
 by the side of this duty there was another to elucidate if possible the source of fortune 
 the opportunity appeared to present itself 
 perhaps thenardier knew something 
 it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man 
 he commenced with this 
 thenardier had caused the honest rustler to disappear in his fob and was gazing at marius with a gentleness that was almost tender 
 marius broke the silence 
 thenardier i have told you your name 
 now would you like to have me tell you your one that you came here to reveal to me 
 i have information of my own also 
 you shall see that i know more about it than you do 
 jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a thief 
 a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer whose ruin he brought about 
 an assassin because he assassinated javert 
 i understand sir ejaculated thenardier 
 i will make myself intelligible 
 in a certain arrondissement of the pas de calais there was in a man who had fallen out with justice and who under the name of m madeleine had regained his status and rehabilitated himself 
 this man had become a just man in the full force of the term 
 in a trade the manufacture of black glass goods he made the fortune of an entire city 
 as far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some sort by accident 
 he was the of the poor 
 he founded hospitals opened schools visited the sick dowered young girls supported widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of the country 
 he refused the cross he was appointed mayor 
 a liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days he denounced him and had him arrested and profited by the arrest to come to paris and cause the banker have the fact from the cashier means of a false signature to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m madeleine 
 this convict who robbed m madeleine was jean valjean 
 as for the other fact you have nothing to tell me about it either 
 jean valjean killed the agent javert he shot him with a pistol 
 i the person who is speaking to you was present 
 thenardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just regained in one instant all the ground which he has lost 
 but the smile returned instantly 
 the triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling 
 thenardier contented himself with saying to marius 
 monsieur le baron we are on the wrong track 
 and he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl 
 what broke forth marius do you dispute that 
 these are facts 
 they are chimeras 
 the confidence with which monsieur le baron honors me renders it my duty to tell him so 
 truth and justice before all things 
 i do not like to see folks accused unjustly 
 monsieur le baron jean valjean did not rob m madeleine and jean valjean did not kill javert 
 this is too much 
 how is this 
 for two reasons 
 what are they 
 speak 
 this is the first 
 he did not rob m madeleine because it is jean valjean himself who was m madeleine 
 what tale are you telling me 
 and this is the second 
 he did not assassinate javert because the person who killed javert was javert 
 what do you mean to say 
 that javert committed suicide 
 prove it prove it cried marius beside himself 
 thenardier resumed scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient alexandrine measure 
 
 but prove it 
 thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes 
 i have my papers he said calmly 
 and he added 
 monsieur le baron in your interests i desired to know jean valjean thoroughly 
 i say that jean valjean and m madeleine are one and the same man and i say that javert had no other assassin than javert 
 if i speak it is because i have proofs 
 not manuscript proofs writing is suspicious handwriting is printed proofs 
 as he spoke thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers yellow faded and strongly saturated with tobacco 
 one of these two newspapers broken at every fold and falling into rags seemed much older than the other 
 two facts two proofs remarked thenardier 
 and he offered the two newspapers unfolded to marius 
 the reader is acquainted with these two papers 
 one the most ancient a number of the drapeau blanc of the th of july the text of which can be seen in the first volume established the identity of m madeleine and jean valjean 
 the other a moniteur of the th of june announced the suicide of javert adding that it appeared from a verbal report of javert to the prefect that having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who holding him under his pistol had fired into the air instead of blowing out his brains 
 marius read 
 he had evidence a certain date irrefragable proof these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up statements the note printed in the moniteur had been an administrative communication from the prefecture of police 
 marius could not doubt 
 the information of the had been false and he himself had been deceived 
 jean valjean who had suddenly grown grand emerged from his cloud 
 marius could not repress a cry of joy 
 well then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man the whole of that fortune really belonged to him he is madeleine the providence of a whole countryside he is jean valjean savior he is a hero he is a saint 
 not a saint and not a hero said thenardier 
 an assassin and a robber 
 and he added in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority 
 let us be calm 
 robber words which marius thought had disappeared and which returned fell upon him like an 
 again said he 
 always ejaculated thenardier 
 jean valjean did not rob madeleine but he is a thief 
 he did not kill javert but he is a murderer 
 will you speak retorted marius of that miserable theft committed forty years ago and expiated as your own newspapers prove by a whole life of repentance of and of virtue 
 i say assassination and theft monsieur le baron and i repeat that i am speaking of actual facts 
 what i have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown 
 it belongs to unpublished matter 
 and perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to madame la baronne by jean valjean 
 i say skilfully because by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share and at the same stroke to conceal crime and to enjoy theft to bury name and to create for oneself a family 
 i might interrupt you at this point said marius but go on 
 monsieur le baron i will tell you all leaving the recompense to your generosity 
 this secret is worth massive gold 
 you will say to me 
 why do not you apply to jean valjean 
 for a very simple reason i know that he has stripped himself and stripped himself in your favor and i consider the combination ingenious but he has no longer a son he would show me his empty hands and since i am in need of some money for my trip to la joya i prefer you you who have it all to him who has nothing 
 i am a little fatigued permit me to take a chair 
 marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same 
 thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair picked up his two newspapers thrust them back into their envelope and murmured as he pecked at the drapeau blanc with his nail 
 it cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one 
 that done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying then he entered upon his subject gravely emphasizing his words 
 monsieur le baron on the th of june about a year ago on the day of the insurrection a man was in the grand sewer of paris at the point where the sewer enters the seine between the pont des invalides and the pont de jena 
 marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of thenardier 
 thenardier noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words 
 this man forced to conceal himself and for reasons moreover which are foreign to politics had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it 
 it was i repeat on the th of june it might have been eight in the evening 
 the man hears a noise in the sewer 
 greatly surprised he hides himself and lies in wait 
 it was the sound of footsteps some one was walking in the dark and coming in his direction 
 strange to say there was another man in the sewer besides himself 
 the grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off 
 a little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer and to see that the man was carrying something on his back 
 he was walking in a bent attitude 
 the man who was walking in a bent attitude was an and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse 
 assassination caught in the very act if ever there was such a thing 
 as for the theft that is understood one does not kill a man gratis 
 this convict was on his way to fling the body into the river 
 one fact is to be noticed that before reaching the exit grating this convict who had come a long distance in the sewer must necessarily have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day while at work on the quagmire and that did not suit the plans 
 he had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden and his exertions must have been terrible for it is impossible to risk life more completely i understand how he could have come out of that alive 
 marius chair approached still nearer 
 thenardier took advantage of this to draw a long breath 
 he went on 
 monsieur le baron a sewer is not the champ de mars 
 one lacks everything there even room 
 when two men are there they must meet 
 that is what happened 
 the man domiciled there and the were forced to bid each other greatly to the regret of both 
 the said to the see what i have on my back i must get out you have the key give it to me 
 that convict was a man of terrible strength 
 there was no way of refusing 
 nevertheless the man who had the key parleyed simply to gain time 
 he examined the dead man but he could see nothing except that the latter was young well dressed with the air of being rich and all disfigured with blood 
 while talking the man contrived to tear and pull off behind without the assassin perceiving it a bit of the assassinated coat 
 a document for conviction you understand a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal 
 he put this document for conviction in his pocket 
 after which he opened the grating made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back closed the grating again and ran off not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river 
 now you comprehend 
 the man who was carrying the corpse was jean valjean the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment and the piece of the coat 
 thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket and holding on a level with his eyes nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers a strip of torn black cloth all covered with dark spots 
 marius had sprung to his feet pale hardly able to draw his breath with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth and without uttering a word without taking his eyes from that fragment he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney 
 he found the key opened the cupboard plunged his arm into it without looking and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which thenardier still held outspread 
 but thenardier continued 
 monsieur le baron i have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by jean valjean and the bearer of an enormous sum of money 
 the young man was myself and here is the coat cried marius and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood 
 then snatching the fragment from the hands of thenardier he crouched down over the coat and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt 
 the rent fitted exactly and the strip completed the coat 
 thenardier was petrified 
 this is what he thought 
 struck all of a heap 
 marius rose to his feet trembling despairing radiant 
 he fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to thenardier presenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with for five hundred and a thousand francs 
 you are an infamous wretch you are a liar a calumniator a villain 
 you came to accuse that man you have only justified him you wanted to ruin him you have only succeeded in glorifying him 
 and it is you who are the thief 
 and it is you who are the assassin 
 i saw you thenardier jondrette in that lair on the rue de i know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if i choose 
 here are a thousand francs bully that you are 
 and he flung a thousand franc note at thenardier 
 ah 
 jondrette thenardier vile rascal 
 let this serve you as a lesson you dealer in secrets merchant of mysteries rummager of the shadows wretch 
 take these five hundred francs and get out of here 
 waterloo protects you 
 waterloo growled thenardier pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand 
 yes assassin 
 you there saved the life of a colonel 
 
 of a general said thenardier elevating his head 
 of a colonel repeated marius in a rage 
 i give a for a general 
 and you come here to commit infamies 
 i tell you that you have committed all crimes 
 go disappear 
 only be happy that is all that i desire 
 ah monster here are three thousand francs more 
 take them 
 you will depart for america with your daughter for your wife is dead you abominable liar 
 i shall watch over your departure you ruffian and at that moment i will count out to you twenty thousand francs 
 go get yourself hung elsewhere 
 monsieur le baron replied thenardier bowing to the very earth eternal gratitude 
 and thenardier left the room understanding nothing stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in 
 struck by lightning he was but he was also content and he would have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such lightning as that 
 let us finish with this man at once 
 two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating he set out thanks to marius care for america under a false name with his daughter azelma furnished with a draft on new york for twenty thousand francs 
 the moral wretchedness of thenardier the bourgeois who had missed his vocation was irremediable 
 he was in america what he had been in europe 
 contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action and to cause evil things to spring from it 
 with marius money thenardier set up as a 
 as soon as thenardier had left the house marius rushed to the garden where cosette was still walking 
 cosette 
 cosette he cried 
 come come quick 
 let us go 
 basque a carriage 
 cosette come 
 ah 
 my god 
 it was he who saved my life 
 let us not lose a minute 
 put on your shawl 
 cosette thought him mad and obeyed 
 he could not breathe he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing 
 he paced back and forth with huge strides he embraced cosette 
 ah 
 cosette 
 i am an unhappy wretch said he 
 marius was bewildered 
 he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure 
 an virtue supreme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him 
 the convict was transfigured into christ 
 marius was dazzled by this prodigy 
 he did not know precisely what he beheld but it was grand 
 in an instant a stood in front of the door 
 marius helped cosette in and darted in himself 
 driver said he rue de arme number 
 the carriage drove off 
 ah what happiness ejaculated cosette 
 rue de arme i did not dare to speak to you of that 
 we are going to see m jean 
 thy father 
 cosette thy father more than ever 
 cosette i guess it 
 you told me that you had never received the letter that i sent you by gavroche 
 it must have fallen into his hands 
 cosette he went to the barricade to save me 
 as it is a necessity with him to be an angel he saved others also he saved javert 
 he rescued me from that gulf to give me to you 
 he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer 
 ah 
 i am a monster of ingratitude 
 cosette after having been your providence he became mine 
 just imagine there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over to drown one in mire 
 cosette he made me traverse it 
 i was unconscious i saw nothing i heard nothing i could know nothing of my own adventure 
 we are going to bring him back to take him with us whether he is willing or not he shall never leave us again 
 if only he is at home 
 provided only that we can find him i will pass the rest of my life in venerating him 
 yes that is how it should be do you see cosette 
 gavroche must have delivered my letter to him 
 all is explained 
 you understand 
 cosette did not understand a word 
 you are right she said to him 
 meanwhile the carriage rolled on

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter v 
 
 a night behind which there is day 
 jean valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door 
 come in he said feebly 
 the door opened 
 cosette and marius made their appearance 
 cosette rushed into the room 
 marius remained on the threshold leaning against the jamb of the door 
 cosette said jean valjean 
 and he sat erect in his chair his arms outstretched and trembling haggard livid gloomy an immense joy in his eyes 
 cosette stifling with emotion fell upon jean breast 
 father said she 
 jean valjean overcome stammered 
 cosette she you 
 madame it is thou 
 ah my god 
 and pressed close in arms he exclaimed 
 it is thou thou art here 
 thou dost pardon me then 
 marius lowering his eyelids in order to keep his tears from flowing took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to repress his sobs 
 my father 
 and you also you pardon me 
 jean valjean said to him 
 marius could find no words and jean valjean added 
 thanks 
 cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed 
 it embarrasses me said she 
 and seating herself on the old knees she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement and kissed his brow 
 jean valjean bewildered let her have her own way 
 cosette who only understood in a very confused manner redoubled her caresses as though she desired to pay marius debt 
 jean valjean stammered 
 how stupid people are 
 i thought that i should never see her again 
 imagine monsieur pontmercy at the very moment when you entered i was saying to myself 
 all is over 
 here is her little gown i am a miserable man i shall never see cosette again and i was saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs 
 was not i an idiot 
 just see how idiotic one can be 
 one reckons without the good god 
 the good god says 
 you fancy that you are about to be abandoned stupid 
 no no things will not go so 
 come there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel 
 and the angel comes and one sees cosette again and one sees little cosette once more 
 ah 
 i was very unhappy 
 for a moment he could not speak then he went on 
 i really needed to see cosette a little bit now and then 
 a heart needs a bone to gnaw 
 but i was perfectly conscious that i was in the way 
 i gave myself reasons 
 they do not want you keep in your own course one has not the right to cling eternally 
 ah 
 god be praised i see her once more 
 dost thou know cosette thy husband is very handsome 
 ah what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on luckily 
 i am fond of that pattern 
 it was thy husband who chose it was it not 
 and then thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls 
 let me call her thou monsieur pontmercy 
 it will not be for long 
 and cosette began again 
 how wicked of you to have left us like that 
 where did you go 
 why have you stayed away so long 
 formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days 
 i sent nicolette the answer always was 
 he is absent 
 how long have you been back 
 why did you not let us know 
 do you know that you are very much changed 
 ah what a naughty father he has been ill and we have not known it 
 stay marius feel how cold his hand is 
 so you are here 
 monsieur pontmercy you pardon me repeated jean valjean 
 at that word which jean valjean had just uttered once more all that was swelling marius heart found vent 
 he burst forth 
 cosette do you hear he has come to that he asks my forgiveness 
 and do you know what he has done for me cosette 
 he has saved my life 
 he has done has given you to me 
 and after having saved me and after having given you to me cosette what has he done with himself 
 he has sacrificed himself 
 behold the man 
 and he says to me the ingrate to me the forgetful to me the pitiless to me the guilty one 
 thanks 
 cosette my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little 
 that barricade that sewer that furnace that that he traversed for me for thee cosette 
 he carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me and accepted for himself 
 every courage every virtue every heroism every sanctity he possesses 
 cosette that man is an angel 
 hush hush said jean valjean in a low voice 
 why tell all that 
 but you cried marius with a wrath in which there was veneration why did you not tell it to me 
 it is your own fault too 
 you save lives and you conceal it from them 
 you do more under the pretext of unmasking yourself you calumniate yourself 
 it is frightful 
 i told the truth replied jean valjean 
 no retorted marius the truth is the whole truth and that you did not tell 
 you were monsieur madeleine why not have said so 
 you saved javert why not have said so 
 i owed my life to you why not have said so 
 because i thought as you do 
 i thought that you were in the right 
 it was necessary that i should go away 
 if you had known about that affair of the sewer you would have made me remain near you 
 i was therefore forced to hold my peace 
 if i had spoken it would have caused embarrassment in every way 
 it would have embarrassed what embarrassed whom retorted marius 
 do you think that you are going to stay here 
 we shall carry you off 
 ah good heavens when i reflect that it was by an accident that i have learned all this 
 you form a part of ourselves 
 you are her father and mine 
 you shall not pass another day in this dreadful house 
 do not imagine that you will be here 
 said jean valjean i shall not be here but i shall not be with you 
 what do you mean replied marius 
 ah come now we are not going to permit any more journeys 
 you shall never leave us again 
 you belong to us 
 we shall not loose our hold of you 
 this time it is for good added cosette 
 we have a carriage at the door 
 i shall run away with you 
 if necessary i shall employ force 
 and she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms 
 your chamber still stands ready in our house she went on 
 if you only knew how pretty the garden is now 
 the azaleas are doing very well there 
 the walks are sanded with river sand there are tiny violet shells 
 you shall eat my strawberries 
 i water them myself 
 and no more madame no more monsieur jean we are living under a republic everybody says thou they marius 
 the programme is changed 
 if you only knew father i have had a sorrow there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall and a horrible cat ate her 
 my poor pretty little robin which used to put her head out of her window and look at me 
 i cried over it 
 i should have liked to kill the cat 
 but now nobody cries any more 
 everybody laughs everybody is happy 
 you are going to come with us 
 how delighted grandfather will be 
 you shall have your plot in the garden you shall cultivate it and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine 
 and then i shall do everything that you wish and then you will obey me prettily 
 jean valjean listened to her without hearing her 
 he heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes 
 he murmured 
 the proof that god is good is that she is here 
 father said cosette 
 jean valjean continued 
 it is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together 
 their trees are full of birds 
 i would walk with cosette 
 it is sweet to be among living people who bid each other who call to each other in the garden 
 people see each other from early morning 
 we should each cultivate our own little corner 
 she would make me eat her strawberries 
 i would make her gather my roses 
 that would be charming 
 only 
 he paused and said gently 
 it is a pity 
 the tear did not fall it retreated and jean valjean replaced it with a smile 
 cosette took both the old hands in hers 
 my god said she your hands are still colder than before 
 are you ill 
 do you suffer 
 i 
 no replied jean valjean 
 i am very well 
 only 
 he paused 
 only what 
 i am going to die presently 
 cosette and marius shuddered 
 to die exclaimed marius 
 yes but that is nothing said jean valjean 
 he took breath smiled and resumed 
 cosette thou wert talking to me go on so thy little robin is dead 
 speak so that i may hear thy voice 
 marius gazed at the old man in amazement 
 cosette uttered a heartrending cry 
 father my father you will live 
 you are going to live 
 i insist upon your living do you hear 
 jean valjean raised his head towards her with adoration 
 oh yes forbid me to die 
 who knows 
 perhaps i shall obey 
 i was on the verge of dying when you came 
 that stopped me it seemed to me that i was born again 
 you are full of strength and life cried marius 
 do you imagine that a person can die like this 
 you have had sorrow you shall have no more 
 it is i who ask your forgiveness and on my knees 
 you are going to live and to live with us and to live a long time 
 we take possession of you once more 
 there are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness 
 you see resumed cosette all bathed in tears that marius says that you shall not die 
 jean valjean continued to smile 
 even if you were to take possession of me monsieur pontmercy would that make me other than i am 
 no god has thought like you and myself and he does not change his mind it is useful for me to go 
 death is a good arrangement 
 god knows better than we what we need 
 may you be happy may monsieur pontmercy have cosette may youth wed the morning may there be around you my children lilacs and nightingales may your life be a beautiful sunny lawn may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls and now let me who am good for nothing die it is certain that all this is right 
 come be reasonable nothing is possible now i am fully conscious that all is over 
 and then last night i drank that whole jug of water 
 how good thy husband is cosette 
 thou art much better off with him than with me 
 a noise became audible at the door 
 it was the doctor entering 
 and farewell doctor said jean valjean 
 here are my poor children 
 marius stepped up to the doctor 
 he addressed to him only this single word 
 monsieur but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question 
 the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance 
 because things are not agreeable said jean valjean that is no reason for being unjust towards god 
 a silence ensued 
 all breasts were oppressed 
 jean valjean turned to cosette 
 he began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity 
 in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at cosette 
 the reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage 
 the doctor felt of his pulse 
 ah it was you that he wanted he murmured looking at cosette and marius 
 and bending down to marius ear he added in a very low voice 
 too late 
 jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without ceasing to gaze at cosette 
 these barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth 
 it is nothing to die it is dreadful not to live 
 all at once he rose to his feet 
 these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony 
 he walked with a firm step to the wall thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health and said in a loud voice as he laid the crucifix on the table 
 behold the great martyr 
 then his chest sank in his head wavered as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him 
 his hands which rested on his knees began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers 
 cosette supported his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him but could not 
 among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears they distinguished words like the following 
 father do not leave us 
 is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again 
 it might be said that agony writhes 
 it goes comes advances towards the sepulchre and returns towards life 
 there is groping in the action of dying 
 jean valjean rallied after this shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more 
 he took a fold of sleeve and kissed it 
 he is coming back doctor he is coming back cried marius 
 you are good both of you said jean valjean 
 i am going to tell you what has caused me pain 
 what has pained me monsieur pontmercy is that you have not been willing to touch that money 
 that money really belongs to your wife 
 i will explain to you my children and for that reason also i am glad to see you 
 black jet comes from england white jet comes from norway 
 all this is in this paper which you will read 
 for bracelets i invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron slides of iron laid together 
 it is prettier better and less costly 
 you will understand how much money can be made in that way 
 so fortune is really hers 
 i give you these details in order that your mind may be set at rest 
 the portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the door 
 the doctor dismissed her 
 but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared 
 would you like a priest 
 i have had one replied jean valjean 
 and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one 
 it is probable in fact that the bishop was present at this death agony 
 cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins 
 jean valjean resumed 
 have no fear monsieur pontmercy i adjure you 
 the six hundred thousand francs really belong to cosette 
 my life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them 
 we managed to do very well with those glass goods 
 we rivalled what is called berlin jewellery 
 however we could not equal the black glass of england 
 a gross which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains only costs three francs 
 when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back 
 cosette gave her hand to marius and both mute with anguish not knowing what to say to the dying man stood trembling and despairing before him 
 jean valjean sank moment by moment 
 he was failing he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon 
 his breath had become intermittent a little rattling interrupted it 
 he found some difficulty in moving his forearm his feet had lost all movement and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow 
 the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes 
 his face paled and smiled 
 life was no longer there it was something else 
 his breath sank his glance grew grander 
 he was a corpse on which the wings could be felt 
 he made a sign to cosette to draw near then to marius the last minute of the last hour had evidently arrived 
 he began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him 
 draw near draw near both of you 
 i love you dearly 
 oh how good it is to die like this 
 and thou lovest me also my cosette 
 i knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man 
 how kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins 
 thou wilt weep for me a little wilt thou not 
 not too much 
 i do not wish thee to have any real griefs 
 you must enjoy yourselves a great deal my children 
 i forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest 
 a gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty 
 it really was a good business 
 so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs monsieur pontmercy 
 it is honest money 
 you may be rich with a tranquil mind 
 thou must have a carriage a box at the theatres now and then and handsome ball dresses my cosette and then thou must give good dinners to thy friends and be very happy 
 i was writing to cosette a while ago 
 she will find my letter 
 i bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the they are of silver but to me they are gold they are diamonds they change candles which are placed in them into i do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high 
 i have done what i could 
 my children you will not forget that i am a poor man you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find under a stone to mark the spot 
 this is my wish 
 no name on the stone 
 if cosette cares to come for a little while now and then it will give me pleasure 
 and you too monsieur pontmercy 
 i must admit that i have not always loved you 
 i ask your pardon for that 
 now she and you form but one for me 
 i feel very grateful to you 
 i am sure that you make cosette happy 
 if you only knew monsieur pontmercy her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight when i saw her in the least pale i was sad 
 in the chest of drawers there is a for five hundred francs 
 i have not touched it 
 it is for the poor 
 cosette dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed dost thou recognize it 
 that was ten years ago however 
 how time flies 
 we have been very happy 
 all is over 
 do not weep my children i am not going very far i shall see you from there you will only have to look at night and you will see me smile 
 cosette dost thou remember montfermeil 
 thou wert in the forest thou wert greatly terrified dost thou remember how i took hold of the handle of the that was the first time that i touched thy poor little hand 
 it was so cold 
 ah your hands were red then mademoiselle they are very white now 
 and the big doll dost thou remember 
 thou didst call her catherine 
 thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent 
 how thou didst make me laugh sometimes my sweet angel 
 when it had been raining thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters and watch them pass away 
 one day i gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow blue and green feathers 
 thou hast forgotten it 
 thou wert roguish so young 
 thou didst play 
 thou didst put cherries in thy ears 
 those are things of the past 
 the forests through which one has passed with child the trees under which one has strolled the convents where one has concealed oneself the games the hearty laughs of childhood are shadows 
 i imagined that all that belonged to me 
 in that lay my stupidity 
 those thenardiers were wicked 
 thou must forgive them 
 cosette the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother 
 she was called fantine 
 remember that 
 kneel whenever thou utterest it 
 she suffered much 
 she loved thee dearly 
 she had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness 
 that is the way god apportions things 
 he is there on high he sees us all and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars 
 i am on the verge of departure my children 
 love each other well and always 
 there is nothing else but that in the world 
 love for each other 
 you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here 
 oh my cosette it is not my fault indeed that i have not seen thee all this time it cut me to the heart i went as far as the corner of the street i must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me pass i was like a madman i once went out without my hat 
 i no longer see clearly my children i had still other things to say but never mind 
 think a little of me 
 come still nearer 
 i die happy 
 give me your dear and heads so that i may lay my hands upon them 
 cosette and marius fell on their knees in despair suffocating with tears each beneath one of jean hands 
 those august hands no longer moved 
 he had fallen backwards the light of the candles illuminated him 
 his white face looked up to heaven he allowed cosette and marius to cover his hands with kisses 
 he was dead 
 the night was starless and extremely dark 
 no doubt in the gloom some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread awaiting that soul

 of ambition 
 ambition is like choler which is an humour that maketh men active earnest full 
 of alacrity and stirring if it be not stopped but if it be stopped and cannot 
 have his way it becometh adust and thereby malign and venomous so ambitious men 
 
 if they find the way open for their rising and still get forward they are rather 
 busy than dangerous but if they be checked in their desires they become secretly 
 discontent and look upon men and matters with an evil eye and are best pleased 
 when things go backward which is the worst property in a servant of a prince or 
 state therefore it is good for princes if they use ambitious men to handle it so 
 as they be still progressive and not retrograde which because it cannot be without 
 inconvenience it is good not to use such natures at all for if they rise not with 
 their service they will take order to make their service fall with them but since 
 we have said it were good not to use men of ambitious natures except it be upon 
 necessity it is fit we speak in what cases they are of necessity good commanders 
 in the wars must be taken be they never so ambitious for me use of their service 
 dispenseth with the rest and to take a soldier without ambition is to pull off his 
 spurs 
 there is also great use of ambitious men in being screens to princes in 
 matters of danger and envy for no man will take that part except he be like a seeled dove that mounts and mounts because he cannot see about him there is use also of ambitious men in pulling down the greatness of any subject that overtops as tiberius used macro in the pulling down of seianus since therefore they must be used in such cases there resteth to speak how they are to be bridled that they may be less dangerous there is less danger of them if they be of mean birth than if they be noble and if they be rather harsh of nature than gracious and popular and if they be rather new raised than grown cunning and fortified in their greatness it is counted by some a weakness in princes to have favourites but it is of all others the best remedy against ambitious for when the way of pleasuring and displeasuring lieth by the favourite it is impossible any other should be over great another means to curb them is to balance them by others as proud as they but then there must be some middle counsellors to keep things steady for without that ballast the ship will roll too much at the least a prince may animate and inure some meaner persons to be as it were scourges to ambitious men 
 as for the having of them obnoxious to ruin if they be of fearful natures it may do well but if they be stout and daring it may precipitate their designs and prove dangerous 
 
 as for the pulling of them down if the affairs require it and that it may not be 
 done with safety suddenly the only way is the interchange continually of favours 
 and disgraces whereby they may not know what to expect and be as it were in a wood of ambitions it is less harmful the ambition to prevail in great things than that other to appear in everything for that breeds confusion and mars business 
 but yet it is less danger to have an ambitious man stirring in business than great in dependencies he that seeketh to be eminent amongst able men 
 hath a great task but that is ever good for the public but he that plots to be the 
 only figure amongst ciphers is the decay of an whole age honour hath three things 
 in it the vantage ground to do good the approach to kings and principal persons and the raising of a own fortunes

 book the year 
 chapter viii 
 
 the death of a horse 
 the dinners are better at than at exclaimed zephine 
 i prefer bombarda to edon declared blachevelle 
 there is more luxury 
 it is more asiatic 
 look at the room downstairs there are mirrors glaces on the walls 
 i prefer them glaces ices on my plate said favourite 
 blachevelle persisted 
 look at the knives 
 the handles are of silver at and of bone at now silver is more valuable than bone 
 except for those who have a silver chin observed tholomyes 
 he was looking at the dome of the invalides which was visible from windows 
 a pause ensued 
 tholomyes exclaimed fameuil listolier and i were having a discussion just now 
 a discussion is a good thing replied tholomyes a quarrel is better 
 we were disputing about philosophy 
 well 
 which do you prefer descartes or spinoza 
 desaugiers said tholomyes 
 this decree pronounced he took a drink and went on 
 i consent to live 
 all is not at an end on earth since we can still talk nonsense 
 for that i return thanks to the immortal lie 
 one lies but one laughs 
 one affirms but one unexpected bursts forth from the syllogism 
 that is are still human beings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the paradox merrily 
 this ladies which you are drinking with so tranquil an air is madeira wine you must know from the vineyard of coural das freiras which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of the while you drink three hundred and seventeen fathoms and monsieur bombarda the magnificent keeper gives you those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fifty centimes 
 again fameuil interrupted him 
 tholomyes your opinions fix the law 
 who is your favorite author 
 ber 
 quin 
 no choux 
 and tholomyes continued 
 honor to bombarda 
 he would equal munophis of elephanta if he could but get me an indian and thygelion of chaeronea if he could bring me a greek courtesan for oh ladies there were bombardas in greece and in egypt 
 apuleius tells us of always the same and nothing new nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation 
 nil sub sole novum says solomon amor omnibus idem says virgil and carabine mounts with carabin into the bark at as aspasia embarked with pericles upon the fleet at samos 
 one last word 
 do you know what aspasia was she lived at an epoch when women had as yet no soul she was a soul a soul of a rosy and purple hue more ardent hued than fire fresher than the dawn 
 aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met she was the goddess prostitute socrates plus manon lescaut 
 aspasia was created in case a mistress should be needed for prometheus 
 tholomyes once started would have found some difficulty in stopping had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead was a beauceron mare old and thin and one fit for the knacker which was dragging a very heavy cart 
 on arriving in front of the exhausted beast had refused to proceed any incident attracted a crowd 
 hardly had the cursing and indignant carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word matin the jade backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip when the jade fell never to rise again 
 on hearing the hubbub made by the passersby tholomyes merry auditors turned their heads and tholomyes took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with this melancholy etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses 
 ont le meme destin 
 et rosse elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses 
 matin 
 she belonged to that circle where cuckoos and carriages share the same fate and a jade herself she lived as jades live for the space of a morning or jade 
 poor horse sighed fantine 
 and dahlia exclaimed 
 there is fantine on the point of crying over horses 
 how can one be such a pitiful fool as that 
 at that moment favourite folding her arms and throwing her head back looked resolutely at tholomyes and said 
 come now the surprise 
 exactly 
 the moment has arrived replied the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has for us a moment ladies 
 it begins with a kiss said blachevelle 
 on the brow added tholomyes 
 each gravely bestowed a kiss on his brow then all four filed out through the door with their fingers on their lips 
 favourite clapped her hands on their departure 
 it is beginning to be amusing already said she 
 be too long murmured fantine we are waiting for you

 return of the jedi 
 vii 
 
 so the dark lord rumbled you have come to me 
 and you to me 
 the emperor is expecting you he believes you will turn to the dark side 
 i knowfather it was momentous act for address his father ashis father but done it now and kept himself under control and the momentwas past it was done he felt stronger for it he felt potent 
 so you have finally accepted the truth vader gloated 
 i have accepted the truth that you were once anakin skywalker my father 
 that name no longer has meaning for me it was a name long ago adifferent life a different universe could he truly once have been that man 
 it is the name of your true self gaze bore steadily down on the cloakedfigure you have only forgotten i know there is good in you the driven it fully away he molded with his voice tried to form the potentialreality with the strength of his belief why you could not destroy why you take me to your emperor now 
 vader seemed almost to smile through his mask at his use of he looked down at the lightsaber the captain had lightsaber so the boy was truly a jedi now a man grown he heldthe lightsaber up you have constructed another 
 this one is mine luke said quietly i no longer use yours 
 vader ignited the blade examined its humming brilliant light like an admiringcraftsman your skills are complete indeed you are as powerful as the emperorhas foreseen 
 they stood there for a moment the lightsaber between them sparks dove inand out of the cutting edge photons pushed to the brink by the energy pulsingbetween these two warriors 
 come with me father 
 vader shook his head ben once thought as you do 
 blame ben for your fall luke took a step closer then stopped 
 vader did not move you know the power of the dark side i mustobey my master 
 i will not will be forced to destroy me 
 if that is your destiny this was not his wish but the boy was itcame at last to blows yes he would destroy luke he could no long afford to holdback as he once had 
 search your feelings father you do this i feel the conflict within go of your hate 
 but vader hated no one he only lusted too blindly someone has filled yourmind with foolish ideas young one the emperor will show you the true nature ofthe force he is your master now 
 vader signaled to a squad of distant stormtroopers as he extinguished the guards approached luke and the dark lord faced one another fora long searching moment vader spoke just before the guards arrived 
 it is too late for me son 
 then my father is truly dead answered luke so what was to stop him fromkilling the evil one who stood before him now he wondered 
 noting perhaps 
 the vast rebel fleet hung poised in space ready to strike it was hundreds from the death in hyperspace all time was a moment and thedeadliness of an attack was measured not in distance but in precision 
 ships changed in formation from corner to side creating a faceted diamondshape to the if like a cobra the fleet was spreading its hood 
 the calculations required to launch such a meticulously coordinated offensive atlightspeed made it necessary to fix on a stationary it stationary relative tothe point of reentry from hyperspace the point chosen by the rebel command wasa small blue planet of the sullust system the armada was positioned around it unblinking cerulean world it looked like the eye of the serpent 
 the millennium falcon finished its rounds of the perimeter checkingfinal positions then pulled into place beneath the flagship the time had come 
 lando was at the controls of the falcon beside him his copilot jowled creature from switches monitoredreadouts and made final preparations for the jump to hyperspace 
 lando set his comlink to war channel last hand of the night his deal a tablefull of high favorite kind of game with dry mouth he made hissummary report to ackbar of the command ship admiral in position allfighters are accounted for 
 voice crackled back over the headset proceed with the groups assume attack coordinates 
 lando turned to his copilot with a quick smile worry my friends aredown there have that shield down on time he turned back to hisinstruments saying under his breath or this will be the shortest offensive of alltime 
 gzhung zhgodio the copilot commented 
 all right lando grunted stand by then he patted the control panel forgood luck even though his deepest belief was that a good gambler made his own what job was this time and han had almost never let lando that was a long time ago in a star system far far away 
 this time was different this time they were going to redefine luck and call itlando he smiled and patted the panel one more timejust right 
 up on the bridge of the star cruiser command ship ackbar paused lookedaround at his generals all was ready 
 are all groups in their attack coordinates he asked he knew they were 
 affirmative admiral 
 ackbar gazed out his meditatively at the starfield for perhaps thelast reflective moment he would ever have he spoke finally into the comlink warchannel all craft will begin the jump to hyperspace on my mark may the forcebe with us 
 he reached forward to the signal button 
 in the falcon lando stared at the identical galactic with foreboding theywere doing what a guerrilla force must never do engage the enemy like a traditionalarmy the imperial army fighting the guerrilla war was it won the rebels by contrast were always theylost and now here was the most dangerous alliance drawn into theopen to fight on the terms if the rebels lost this battle they lost the war 
 suddenly the signal light flashed on the control panel mark theattack was commenced 
 lando pulled back the conversion switch and opened up the throttle outsidethe cockpit the stars began streaking by the streaks grew brighter and longer asthe ships of the fleet roared in large segments at lightspeed keeping pace first withthe very photons of the radiant stars in the vicinity and then soaring through the warpinto hyperspace disappearing the flash of a muon 
 the blue crystal planet hovered in space alone once again staring the void 
 the strike squad crouched behind a woodsy ridge overlooking the imperialoutpost leia viewed the area through a small electronic scanner 
 two shuttles were being on the landing platform docking walkers were parked nearby troops stood around helped with watch carried supplies the massive shield generator hummed off to the side 
 flattened down in the bushes on the ridge with the strike force were severalewoks including wicket paploo teebo and warwick the rest stayed the knoll out of sight 
 leia put down the scanner and scuttled back to the others the entrance is onthe far side of that landing platform this going to be easy 
 ahrck grah rahr hrowrowhr chewbacca agreed 
 oh come on chewie han gave the wookiee a pained look gotteninto more heavily guarded places than that 
 frowh rahgh rahrahraff vrawgh gr chewie countered with a dismissinggesture 
 han thought of a second well the spice vaults of gargon for one 
 of course if i could just remember how i did it hanscratched his head poking his memory 
 suddenly paploo began chattering away pointing squealing he garbledsomething to wicket 
 he saying threepio leia asked 
 the golden droid exchanged a few terse sentences with paploo then wicketturned to leia with a hopeful grin 
 threepio too now looked at the princess apparently wicket know about aback entrance to this installation 
 han perked up at that a back door it how we did it 
 four imperial scouts kept watch over the entrance to the bunker from the earth far to the rear of the main section of the shield generatorcomplex their rocket bikes were parked nearby 
 in the undergrowth beyond the rebel strike squad lay in wait 
 grrr rowf rrrhl brhnnn chewbacca observed slowly 
 right chewie solo agreed with just those guards this should byeasier than breaking a bantha 
 it only takes one to sound the alarm leia cautioned 
 han grinned a bit overselfconfidently then have to do this realquietlike if luke can just keep vader off our backs like you said he said he oughta be no sweat just gotta hit those guards fast and quiet 
 threepio whispered to teebo and paploo explaining the problem and theobjective the ewoks babbled giddily a moment then paploo jumped up and racedthrough the underbrush 
 leia checked the instrument on her wrist running out of time in hyperspace by now 
 threepio muttered a question to teebo and received a short reply oh replied starting to rise to look into the clearing beside the bunker 
 stay down rasped solo 
 what is it threepio leia demanded 
 afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rush thedroid hoped he to be blamed for this 
 what are you talking about voice cut with an edge of fear 
 oh no look 
 paploo had scampered down through the bushes to where the scouts bikes wereparked now with the sickening horror of inevitability the rebel leaders watchedthe little ball of fur swing his pudgy body up onto one of the bikes and begin flippingswitches at random before anyone could do anything the engines ignitedwith a rumbling roar the four scouts looked over in surprise paploo grinnedmadly and continued flipping switches 
 leia held her forehead oh no no no 
 chewie barked han nodded so much for our surprise attack 
 the imperial scouts raced toward paploo just as the forward drive the little teddy bear into the forest he had all he could do just to hang onto the handlebar with his stubby paws three of the guards jumped on their ownbikes and sped off in pursuit of the hotrod ewok the fourth scout stayed at his the door of the bunker 
 leia was delighted if a bit incredulous 
 not bad for a ball of fuzz han admired he nodded at chewie and the twoof them slipped down toward the bunker 
 paploo meanwhile was sailing through the trees more lucky than in was going at fairly low velocity for what the bike could in was absolutely dizzy with speed and excitement it was terrifying but heloved it he could talk about this ride until the end of his life and then his childrenwould tell their children and it would get faster with each generation 
 for now though the imperial scouts were already pulling in sight behind a moment later they began firing laser bolts at him he decided finallyhad enough as he rounded the next tree just out of their sight he grabbed a vineand swung up into the branches several seconds later the three scouts tore byunderneath him pressing their pursuit to the limit he giggled furiously 
 back at the bunker the laser scout was undone subdued by chewbacca of his suit he was being carried into the woods now by two other members ofthe strike team the rest of the squad silently crouched forming a perimeter aroundthe entrance 
 han stood at the door checking the stolen code against the digits on the panel with natural speed he punched a series of buttons on the the door opened 
 leia peeked inside no sigh of life she motioned the others and entered thebunker han and chewie followed close on her heels soon the entire team washuddled inside the otherwise empty steel corridor leaving one lookout in the unconscious uniform han pushed a series of buttons on theinner panel closing the door behind them 
 leia thought briefly of hoped he could detain vader at least longenough to allow her to destroy this shield generator she hoped even more dearly hecould avoid such a confrontation altogether for she feared vader was the strongerof the two 
 furtively she led the way down the dark and tunnel 
 shuttle settled onto the docking bay of the death star like a bird like a nightmare insect luke and the dark lordemerged from the snout of the beast with a small escort of stormtroopers and walkedrapidly across the cavernous main bay to the tower elevator 
 royal guards awaited them there flanking the shaft bathed in a carmine opened the elevator door luke stepped forward 
 his mind was buzzing with what to do it was the emperor he was being takento now the emperor if luke could but focus keep his mind clear to see whatmust be do it 
 a great noise filled his head though like an underground wind 
 he hoped leia deactivated the deflector shield quickly and destroyed the while all three of them were here before anything else happened forthe closer luke came to the emperor the more anything he feared would happen ablack storm raged inside him he wanted to kill the emperor but then vader what would his father do and what if luke faced his father him him the thought was at once repugnant and then what for the first time luke had a brief murky image ofhimself standing on his body holding his blazing power and sittingat the right hand 
 he squeezed his eyes shut against this thought but it left a cold sweat on hisbrow as if hand had brushed him there and left its shallow imprint 
 the elevator door opened luke and vader walked out into the throne roomalone across the unlit antechamber up the grated stairs to stand before the and son side by side both dressed in black one masked and one the gaze of the malignant emperor 
 vader bowed to his master the emperor motioned him to rise though thedark lord did his bidding 
 welcome young skywalker the evil one smiled graciously i have beenexpecting you 
 luke stared back brazenly at the bent hooded figure defiantly smile grew even softer though even more fatherly he looked at 
 you no longer need these he added with noblesse made theslightest motion with his finger in the direction of wrists at that simply fell away clattering noisily to the floor 
 luke looked at his own now to reach out for the crush his windpipe in an instant 
 yet the emperor seemed gentle had he not just let luke free but he wasdevious too luke knew do not be fooled by appearances ben had told him theemperor was unarmed he could still strike but aggression part of thedark side he avoid that at all costs or could he use darkness then put it away he stared at his free handshe could have ended it all could he he had total freedom to choose what to do now yet he couldnot choose choice the sword he could kill the emperor he couldsuccumb to the arguments he could kill vaderand then he could evenbecome vader again this thought laughed at him like a broken clown until hepushed it back into a black corner of his brain 
 the emperor sat before him smiling the moment was convulsive withpossibilities 
 the moment passed he did nothing 
 tell me young skywalker the emperor said when he saw first strugglehad taken its course who has been involved in your training until now thesmile was thin hollow 
 luke was silent he would reveal nothing 
 oh i know it was kenobi at first the wicked ruler continued rubbinghis fingers together as if trying to remember then pausing his lips creased into asneer of course we are familiar with the talent kenobi had when itcame to training jedi he nodded politely in direction previous star pupil vader stood without responding without moving 
 luke tensed with fury at the defamation of of the emperor it was praise and he bridled even more knowing the emperor wasso nearly right he tried to bring his anger under control though for it seemed toplease the malevolent dictator greatly 
 palpatine noted the emotions on face and chuckled so in your earlytraining you have followed your path it would seem but alas isnow dead i believe his elder student here saw to that again he made a handmotion toward vader so tell me young continued yourtraining 
 that smile again like a knife luke held silent struggling to regain hiscomposure 
 the emperor tapped his fingers on the arm of the throne recalling there wasone calledyoda an aged master jediah i see by your countenance i have hit achord a resonant chord indeed yoda then 
 luke flashed with anger at himself now to have revealed so much anger and he strove to calm see all to shownothing only to be 
 this yoda the emperor mused lives he still 
 luke focused on the emptiness of space beyond the window behind chair the deep void where nothing was nothing he filled his mindwith this black nothing opaque save for the occasional flickering of starlight thatfiltered through the ether 
 ah cried emperor palpatine he lives not very good young almost hid this from me but you could not and you can not your deepestflickerings are to me apparent your nakedest soul that is my first lesson to beamed 
 luke a moment in the very faltering he found strength thushad ben and yoda both instructed him when you are attacked fall let power buffet you as strong wind topples the grass in time he willexpend himself and you will still be upright 
 the emperor watched face with cunning sure yoda taught you touse the force with great skill 
 the taunt had its desired face flushed his muscles flexed 
 he saw the emperor actually lick his lips at the sight of reaction lickhis lips and laugh from the bottom of his throat the bottom of his soul 
 luke paused for he saw something else as well something he seenbefore in the emperor fear 
 luke saw fear in the of luke fear of power fear thatthis power could be turned on the the same way vader hadturned it on kenobi luke saw this fear in the he knew odds had shifted slightly he had glimpsed the nakedest self 
 with sudden absolute calm luke stood upright he stared directly intc themalign hood 
 palpatine said nothing for a few moments returning the young his strengths and weaknesses he sat back at last pleased with this firstconfrontation i look forward to completing your training young skywalker intime you will call me master 
 for the first time luke felt steady enough to speak gravely will not convert me as you did my father 
 no my young jedi the emperor leaned forward gloating you will find thatit is you who are mistakenabout a great many things 
 palpatine suddenly stood came down from his throne walked up very close toluke stared venomously into the eyes at last luke saw the entire facewithin the hood eyes sunken like tombs the flesh decayed beneath skin weatheredby virulent storms lined by holocaust the grin a the breath corrupt 
 vader extended a gloved hand toward the emperor holding out emperor took it with a slow sort of glee then walked with it across the room tothe huge circular the death star had been revolving slowly so thesanctuary moon was now visible at the curving margin 
 palpatine looked at endor then back at the lightsaber in his hand ah yes weapon much like your he faced luke directly by now youmust know your father can never be turned from the dark side so will it be withyou 
 never soon i will die and you with me luke was confident of that allowed himself the luxury of a boast 
 the emperor laughed a vile laugh perhaps you refer to the imminent attackof your rebel fleet luke had a thick reeling moment then steadied himself theemperor went on i assure you we are quite safe from your friends here 
 vader walked toward the emperor stood at his side looking at luke 
 luke felt increasingly raw your overconfidence is your weakness hechallenged them 
 your faith in your friends is yours the emperor began smiling but then hismouth turned down his voice grew angry everything that has transpired has doneso according to my design your friends up there on the sanctuary into a trap and so is your rebel fleet 
 face twitched visibly the emperor saw this and really began to was i who allowed the alliance to know the location of the shield generator it isquite safe from your pitiful little entire legion of my troops awaits themthere 
 eyes darted from the emperor to vader and finally to the lightsaber inthe hand his mind quivered with alternatives suddenly everything wasout of control again he could count on nothing but himself and on himself hishold was tenuous 
 the emperor kept rattling on imperiously afraid the deflector shield willbe quite operational when your fleet arrives and that is only the beginning of of course i wish to spoil it for you 
 the situation was degenerating fast from perspective defeat afterdefeat was being piled on his head how much could he take and now anothersurprise coming there seemed to be no end to the rank deeds palpatine could carryout against the galaxy slowly infinitesimally luke raised his hand in the directionof the lightsaber 
 the emperor continued from here young skywalker you will witness thefinal destruction of the the end of your insignificant rebellion 
 luke was in torment he raised his hand further he realized both palpatineand vader were watching him he lowered his hand lowered his level of to restore his previous calm to find his center to see what it was he needed to do 
 the emperor smiled a thin dry smile he offered the lightsaber to want this you the hate is swelling in you now very good take yourjedi weapon use it i am unarmed strike me down with it give in your each passing moment you make yourself more my servant 
 his rasping laughter echoed off the walls like desert wind vader continuedstaring at luke 
 luke tried to hide his agony no never he thought desperately of ben andyoda they were part of the force now part of the energy that shaped it was itpossible for them to distort the vision by their presence no one wasinfallible ben had told the emperor see everything every future twist every reality to suit his gluttony ben thought luke if everi needed your guidance it is now where can i take this that it will not lead me toruin 
 as if in answer the emperor leered and put the lightsaber down on the controlchair near hand it is unavoidable the emperor said quietly it is yourdestiny you like your father are nowmine 
 luke had never felt so lost 
 han chewie leia and a dozen commandos made their way down thelabyrinthine corridors toward the area where the shield generator room was marked onthe stolen map yellow lights illuminated the low rafters casting long shadows ateach intersection at the first three turnings all remained quiet they saw no guardor worker 
 at the fourth six imperial stormtroopers stood a wary watch 
 there was no way around the section had to be traversed han and leia lookedat each other and shrugged there was nothing for it but to fight 
 with pistols drawn they barged into the entryway almost as if beenexpecting an attack the guards instantly crouched and began firing their own barrage of laserbolts followed ricocheting from girder to floor twostormtroopers were hit immediately a third lost his gun pinned behind arefrigerator console he was unable to do much but stay low 
 two more stood behind a fire door though and blasted each commando whotried to get through four went down the guards were virtually impregnablebehind their vulcanized virtually account for wookiees 
 chewbacca rushed the door physically dislodging it on top of the twostormtroopers they were crushed 
 leia shot the sixth guard as he stood to draw a bead on chewie the been crouching beneath the refrigeration unit suddenly bolted to go for raced after him a few long strides and brought him down with a flying was out cold 
 they checked themselves over accounted for casualties not too ithad been noisy have to hurry now before a general alarm was set thepower center that controlled the shield generator was very near and there would beno second chances 
 the rebel fleet broke out of hyperspace with an awesome roar amidglistening streamers of light battalion after battalion emerged in formation to fire offtoward the death star and its sanctuary moon hovering brightly in the close the entire navy was bearing down on its target the millennium falcon in thelead 
 lando was worried from the moment they came out of hyperspace he checkedhis screen reversed polarities queried the computer 
 the copilot was perplexed as well zhnh ahzi gngnohzh dzhy lyhz 
 but how could that be lando demanded got to be able to get somekind of reading on the shield up or down who was conning whom on this raid 
 nien nunb pointed at the control panel shaking his head dzhmbd 
 jammed how could they be jamming us if they 
 he grimaced at the onrushing death star as the implications of what justsaid sank in this was not a surprise attack after all it was a spider web 
 he hit the switch on his comlink break off the attack the still up 
 red voice shouted back over the headphones i get no reading areyou sure 
 pull up lando commanded all craft pull up 
 he banked hard to the left the fighters of the red squad veering close on his tail 
 some make it three flanking nicked the invisible deflectorshield spinning out of control exploding in flames along the shield surface noneof the others paused to look back 
 on the rebel star cruiser bridge alarms were screaming light flashing klaxonsblaring as the mammoth space cruiser abruptly altered its momentum trying tochange course in time to avoid collision with the shield officers were running frombattle stations to navigation controls other ships in the fleet could be seen through careening wildly in a hundred directions some slowing some speedingup 
 admiral ackbar spoke urgently but quietly into the comlink take evasiveaction green group steer course for holding sector mg blue group 
 a mon calamari controller across the bridge called out to ackbar with graveexcitement admiral we have enemy ships at sector rt and pb 
 the large central was coming alive it was no longer just thedeath star and the green moon behind it gloating isolated in space now themassive imperial fleet could be seen flying in perfect regimental formation out frombehind endor in two behemoth flanking to surround the rebel fleetfrom both sides like the pincers of a deadly scorpion 
 and the shield barricaded the alliance in front they had nowhere to go 
 ackbar spoke desperately into the comlink a trap prepare for attack 
 an anonymous fighter voice came back over the radio fighterscoming in here we go 
 the attack began the battle was joined 
 tie fighters were much faster than the bulky imperial cruisers sothey were the first to make contact with the rebel invaders savage dogfightsensued and soon the black sky was aglow with ruby explosions 
 an aide approached ackbar added power to the forward 
 good double power on the main battery and 
 suddenly the star cruiser was rocked by thermonuclear fireworks outside theobservation window 
 gold wing is hit hard another officer shouted stumbling up to the bridge 
 give them cover ackbar ordered we must have time he spoke againinto the comlink as yet another detonation rumbled the frigate all ships standyour position wait for my command to return 
 it was far too late for lando and his attack squadrons to heed that order were already way ahead of the pack heading straight for the oncoming imperialfleet 
 wedge antilles old buddy from the first campaign let the thataccompanied the falcon as they drew near the imperial defenders his voice cameover the comlink calm and experienced lock in attack positions 
 the wings split like dragonfly gossamers poised for increased maneuvering andpower 
 all wings report in said lando 
 red leader standing by wedge replied 
 green leader standing by 
 blue leader standing by 
 gray leader 
 this last transmission was interrupted by a display of pyrotechnics thatcompletely disintegrated gray wing 
 here they come wedge commented 
 accelerate to attack speed lando ordered draw fire away from ourcruisers as long as possible 
 copy gold leader wedge responded moving to point three acrossthe axis 
 two of them coming in at twenty degrees someone advised 
 i see them noted wedge cut left take the leader 
 watch yourself wedge three from above 
 yeah i 
 on it red leader 
 too many of them 
 taking a lot of fire back off 
 red four watch out 
 hit 
 the spun sparking across the starfield out of power into the void 
 picked one up watch it red six yelled at wedge 
 my negative where is he 
 red six a squadron of fighters has broken through 
 heading for the medical frigate after them 
 go ahead lando agreed going in four marks at point threefive cover me 
 right behind you gold leader red two red three pull in 
 hang on back there 
 close up formations blue group 
 good shooting red two 
 not bad said lando take out the other three 
 calrissian steered the falcon into the complete flip as his crew fired at theimperial fighters from the belly guns two were direct hits the third a glancingblow that caused the tie fighter to tumble into another of its own squads theheavens were absolutely thick with them but the falcon was faster by half thananything else that flew 
 within a matter of minutes the battlefield was a diffuse red glow spotted withpuffs of smoke blazing fireballs whirling spark showers spinning debris rumblingimplosions shafts of light tumbling machinery corpses wells ofblackness electron storms 
 it was a grim and dazzling spectacle and only beginning 
 nien nunb made a guttural aside to lando 
 right the pilot frowned only their fighters are attacking what arethose star destroyers waiting for looked like the emperor was trying to get therebels to buy some real estate he intending to sell 
 dzhng zhng the copilot warned as another squadron of tie fighters swoopeddown from above 
 i see em sure in the middle of it now he took a second to glanceat endor floating peacefully off to his right come on han old buddy let medown 
 han pressed the button on his and covered his head the reinforceddoor to the main control room blew into melted pieces the rebel squad stormedthrough the gaping portal 
 the stormtroopers inside seemed taken completely by surprise a few wereinjured by the exploding door the rest gawked in dismay as the rebels rushed themwith guns drawn han took the lead leia right behind chewie covered the rear 
 they herded all the personnel into one corner of the bunker three commandosguarded them there three more covered the exits the rest began placing theexplosive charges 
 leia studied one of the screens on the control panel hurry han look being attacked 
 solo looked over at the screen blast it with the shield still up against the wall 
 that is correct came a voice from the rear of the room just as you are 
 han and leia spun around to find dozens of imperial guns trained on them anentire legion had been hiding in the wall compartments of the bunker now in asingle moment the rebels were to run far too manystormtroopers to fight completely surrounded 
 more imperial troops charged through the door roughly disarming the stunnedcommandos 
 han chewie and leia exchanged helpless hopeless looks been last chance 
 failed 
 some distance from the main area of battle coasting safely in the center of theblanket of ships that constituted the imperial fleet was the flagship super stardestroyer on the bridge admiral piett watched the war through the enormousobservation as if viewing an elaborate demonstration or anentertainment 
 two fleet captains stood behind him respectfully silent also learning the elegantdesigns of their emperor 
 have the fleet hold here admiral piett ordered 
 the first captain hurried to carry out the order the second stepped up to thewindow beside the admiral we going to attack 
 piett smirked i have my orders from the emperor himself he hassomething special planned for this rebel scum he accented the specialness with along pause for the inquisitive captain to savor we are only to keep them fromescaping 
 the emperor lord vader and luke watched the aerial battle rage from thesafety of the throne room in the death star 
 it was a scene of pandemonium silent crystalline explosions surrounded bygreen violet or magenta auras wildly vicious dogfights gracefully floatingcrags of melted steel icicle sprays that might have been blood 
 luke watched in horror as another rebel ship toppled against the unseeabledeflector shield exploding in a fiery concussion 
 vader watched luke his boy was powerful stronger than still pliable not lost to the sickening weakly side of the force thathad to beg for everything it received or to the emperor who feared luke with reason
