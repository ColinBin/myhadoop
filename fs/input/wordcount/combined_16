lionfish nov chapter sixteen in the headcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione made no mention of harry giving defence against the dark arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion detentions with umbridge were finally over he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely ron had had four more quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in transfiguration hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens before the subject was broached again on a wild blustery evening at the end of september when the three of them were sitting in the library looking up potion ingredients for snape 
 
 i was wondering hermione said suddenly whether thought any more about defence against the dark arts harry 
 
 course i have said harry grumpily forget it can we with that hag teaching us 
 
 i meant the idea ron and i had ron cast her an alarmed threatening kind of look she frowned at him oh all right the idea i had thenabout you teaching us 
 
 harry did not answer at once he pretended to be perusing a page of asiatic because he did not want to say what was in his mind 
 
 he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight sometimes it seemed an insane idea just as it had on the night hermione had proposed it but at others he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with dark creatures and death eatersfound himself in fact subconsciously planning lessons 
 
 well he said slowly when he could no longer pretend to find asiatic interesting yeah thought about it a bit 
 
 and said hermione eagerly 
 
 i dunno said harry playing for time he looked up at ron 
 
 i thought it was a good idea from the start said ron who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure harry was not going to start shouting again 
 
 harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair 
 
 you did listen to what i said about a load of it being luck you 
 
 yes harry said hermione gently but all the same no point pretending that not good at defence against the dark arts because you are you were the only person last year who could throw off the imperius curse completely you can produce a patronus you can do all sorts of stuff that wizards viktor always said 
 
 ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck rubbing it he said yeah what did vicky say 
 
 ho ho said hermione in a bored voice he said harry knew how to do stuff even he and he was in the final year at durmstrang 
 
 ron was looking at hermione suspiciously 
 
 not still in contact with him are you 
 
 so what if i am said hermione coolly though her face was a little pink i can have a if i 
 
 he only want to be your said ron accusingly 
 
 hermione shook her head exasperatedly and ignoring ron who was continuing to watch her said to harry well what do you think will you teach us 
 
 just you and ron yeah 
 
 well said hermione looking a mite anxious again well now fly off the handle again harry please but i really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn i mean talking about defending ourselves against oh be pathetic ron it seem fair if we offer the chance to other people 
 
 harry considered this for a moment then said yeah but i doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me a nutter remember 
 
 well i think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what got to say said hermione seriously look she leaned towards him ron who was still watching her with a frown on his face leaned forwards to listen know the first weekend in a hogsmeade weekend how would it be if we tell anyone interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over 
 
 why do we have to do it outside school said ron 
 
 because said hermione returning to the diagram of the chinese chomping cabbage she was copying i think umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to 
 
 harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into hogsmeade but there was one thing worrying him sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of september harry knew they had made him angry by saying they want him to comebut he still worried from time to time that sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway what were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in hogsmeade perhaps under the nose of draco malfoy 
 
 well you blame him for wanting to get out and about said ron when harry discussed his fears with him and hermione i mean been on the run for over two years he and i know that have been a laugh but at least he was free he and now just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf 
 
 hermione scowled at ron but otherwise ignored the slight on kreacher 
 
 the trouble is she said to harry until for comes out into the open sirius is going to have to stay hidden he i mean the stupid ministry going to realise sirius is innocent until they accept that been telling the truth about him all along and once the fools start catching real death eaters again be obvious sirius one i mean he got the mark for one thing 
 
 i reckon be stupid enough to turn up said ron bracingly go mad if he did and sirius listens to dumbledore even if he like what he hears 
 
 when harry continued to look worried hermione said listen ron and i have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper defence against the dark arts and there are a couple who seem interested told them to meet us in hogsmeade 
 
 right said harry vaguely his mind still on sirius 
 
 worry harry hermione said quietly got enough on your plate without sirius too 
 
 she was quite right of course he was barely keeping up with his homework though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with umbridge ron was even further behind with his work than harry because while they both had quidditch practice twice a week ron also had his prefect duties however hermione who was taking more subjects than either of them had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes harry had to admit that she was getting better it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks 
 
 the morning of the hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy alter breakfast they queued up in front of filch who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village with a slight pang harry remembered that if it been for sirius he would not have been going at all 
 
 when harry reached filch the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from harry then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and harry walked on out on to the stone steps and the cold sunlit day 
 
 erwhy was filch sniffing you asked ron as he harry and hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates 
 
 i suppose he was checking for the smell of dungbombs said harry with a small laugh i forgot to tell you 
 
 and he recounted the story of sending his letter to sirius and filch bursting in seconds later demanding to see the letter to his slight surprise hermione found this story highly interesting much more indeed than he did himself 
 
 he said he was tipped off you were ordering dungbombs but who tipped him off 
 
 i dunno said harry shrugging maybe malfoy think it was a laugh 
 
 they walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village the wind whip ping their hair into their eyes 
 
 malfoy said hermione sceptically well yes maybe 
 
 and she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of hogsmeade 
 
 where are we going anyway harry asked the three broomsticks 
 
 ohno said hermione coming out of her reverie no always packed and really noisy told the others to meet us in the head that other pub you know the one not on the main road i think a bit you know dodgy but students normally go in there so i think be overheard 
 
 they walked down the main street past wizarding joke shop where they were not surprised to see fred george and lee jordan past the post office from which owls issued at regular intervals and turned up a at the top of which stood a small inn a battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door with a picture on it of a wild severed head leaking blood on to the white cloth around it the sign creaked in the wind as they approached all three of them hesitated outside the door 
 
 well come on said hermione slightly nervously harry led the way inside 
 
 it was not at all like the three broomsticks whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness the head bar comprised one small dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats the bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables the floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth though as harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries 
 
 harry remembered hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year yeh get a lot o funny folk in the head he had said explaining how he had won a egg from a hooded stranger there at the time harry had wondered why hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the head there was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking fiery substance through a slit over his mouth two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong yorkshire accents and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick black veil that fell to her toes they could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly 
 
 i know about this hermione harry muttered as they crossed to the bar he was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch has it occurred to you umbridge might be under that 
 
 hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure 
 
 umbridge is shorter than that woman she said quietly and anyway even if umbridge does come in here nothing she can do to stop us harry because double and the school rules not out of bounds i specifically asked professor flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the head and he said yes but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses and looked up everything i can think of about study groups and homework groups and definitely allowed i just think a good idea if we parade what doing 
 
 no said harry drily especially as not exactly a homework group planning is it 
 
 the barman sidled towards them out of a back room he was a old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard he was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to harry 
 
 what he grunted 
 
 three butterbeers please said hermione 
 
 the man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty very dirty bottles which he slammed on the bar 
 
 six sickles he said 
 
 get them said harry quickly passing over the silver the eyes travelled over harry resting for a fraction of a second on his scar then he turned away and deposited money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it harry ron and hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down looking around the man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman 
 
 you know what ron murmured looking over at the bar with enthusiasm we could order anything we liked in here i bet that bloke would sell us anything he care always wanted to try firewhisky 
 
 youareaprefect snarled hermione 
 
 oh said ron the smile fading from his face yeah 
 
 so who did you say is supposed to be meeting us harry asked wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig 
 
 just a couple of people hermione repeated checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door i told them to be here about now and sure they all know where it isoh look this might be them now 
 
 the door of the pub had opened a thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people 
 
 first came neville with dean and lavender who were closely followed by parvati and padma patil with stomach did a cho and one of her girlfriends then on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident luna lovegood then katie bell alicia spinnet and angelina johnson colin and dennis creevey ernie macmillan justin hannah abbott a hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name harry did not know three ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called anthony goldstein michael corner and terry boot ginny closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the hufflepuff quidditch team and bringing up the rear fred and george weasley with their friend lee jordan all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with merchandise 
 
 a couple of people said harry hoarsely to hermione a couple of people 
 
 yes well the idea seemed quite popular said hermione happily ron do you want to pull up some more chairs 
 
 the barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed possibly he had never seen his pub so full 
 
 hi said fred reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly could we have butterbeers please 
 
 the barman glared at him for a moment then throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar 
 
 cheers said fred handing them out cough up everyone i got enough gold for all of these 
 
 harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins he could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech at which he rounded on hermione 
 
 what have you been telling people he said in a low voice what are they expecting 
 
 told you they just want to hear what got to say said hermione soothingly but harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly you have to do anything yet speak to them first 
 
 hi harry said neville beaming and taking a seat opposite him 
 
 harry tried to smile back but did not speak his mouth was exceptionally dry cho had just smiled at him and sat down on right her friend who had curly hair did not smile but gave harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that given her way she would not be here at all 
 
 in twos and threes the new arrivals settled around harry ron and hermione some looking rather excited others curious luna lovegood gazing dreamily into space when everybody had pulled up a chair the chatter died out every eye was upon harry 
 
 er said hermione her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves wellerhi 
 
 the group focused its attention on her instead though eyes continued to dart back regularly to harry 
 
 well erm well you know why here erm well harry here had the ideai mean harry had thrown her a sharp look i had the ideathat it might be good if people who wanted to study defence against the dark artsand i mean really study it you know not the rubbish that umbridge is doing with us voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident because nobody could call that defence against the dark arts hear hear said anthony goldstein and hermione looked heartened well i thought it would be good if we well took matters into our own hands 
 
 she paused looked sideways at harry and went on and by that i mean learning how to defend ourselves properly not just in theory but doing the real spells 
 
 you want to pass your defence against the dark arts owl too though i bet said michael corner who was watching her closely 
 
 of course i do said hermione at once but more than that i want to be properly trained in defence because because she took a great breath and finished because lord voldemort is back 
 
 the reaction was immediate and predictable friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself terry boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch padma patil shuddered and neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough all of them however looked fixedly even eagerly at harry 
 
 well the plan anyway said hermione if you want to join us we need to decide how going to 
 
 the proof back said the blond hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice 
 
 well dumbledore believes it hermione began 
 
 you mean dumbledore believes him said the blond boy nodding at harry 
 
 who are you said ron rather rudely 
 
 zacharias smith said the boy and i think got the right to know exactly what makes him say back 
 
 look said hermione intervening swiftly really not what this meeting was supposed to be about 
 
 ok hermione said harry 
 
 it had just dawned on him why there were so many people there he thought hermione should have seen this coming some of these peoplemaybe even most of themhad turned up in the hopes of hearing story firsthand 
 
 what makes me say back he repeated looking zacharias straight in the face i saw him but dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year and if you believe him you believe me and not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone 
 
 the whole group seemed to have held its breath while harry spoke harry had the impression that even the barman was listening he was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag making it steadily dirtier 
 
 zacharias said dismissively all dumbledore told us last year was that cedric diggory got killed by and that you brought body back to hogwarts he give us details he tell us exactly how diggory got murdered i think all like to know 
 
 if come to hear exactly what it looks like when voldemort murders someone i help you harry said his temper always so close to the surface these days was rising again he did not take his eyes from zacharias aggressive face and was determined not to look at cho i want to talk about cedric diggory all right so if what here for you might as well clear out 
 
 he cast an angry look in direction this was he felt all her fault she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was but none of them left their seats not even zacharias smith though he continued to gaze intently at harry 
 
 so said hermione her voice very again so like i was saying if you want to learn some defence then we need to work out how going to do it how often going to meet and where going to 
 
 is it true interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back looking at harry that you can produce a patronus 
 
 there was a murmur of interest around the group at this 
 
 yeah said harry slightly defensively 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 the phrase stirred something in memory 
 
 eryou know madam bones do you he asked 
 
 the girl smiled 
 
 my auntie she said susan bones she told me about your hearing sois it really true you make a stag patronus 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 blimey harry said lee looking deeply impressed i never knew that 
 
 mum told ron not to spread it around said fred grinning at harry she said you got enough attention as it was 
 
 not wrong mumbled harry and a couple of people laughed 
 
 the veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat 
 
 and did you kill a basilisk with that sword in office demanded terry boot what one of the portraits on the wall told me when i was in there last year 
 
 eryeah i did yeah said harry 
 
 justin whistled the creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and lavender brown said wow softly harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now he was determinedly looking anywhere but at cho 
 
 and in our first year said neville to the group at large he saved that philological stone 
 
 hissed hermione 
 
 yes thatfrom finished neville 
 
 hannah abbotts eyes were as round as galleons 
 
 and not to mention said cho eyes snapped across to her she was looking at him smiling his stomach did another somersault all the tasks he had to get through in the triwizard tournament last yeargetting past dragons and merpeople and acromantula and things 
 
 there was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table insides were squirming he was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself the fact that cho had just praised him made it much much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them 
 
 look he said and everyone fell silent at once i i want to sound like trying to be modest or anything but i had a lot of help with all that stuff 
 
 not with the dragon you said michael corner at once that was a seriously cool bit of flying 
 
 yeah well said harry feeling it would be churlish to disagree 
 
 and nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer said susan bones 
 
 no said harry no ok i know i did bits of it without help but the point trying to make is 
 
 are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff said zacharias smith 
 
 an idea said ron loudly before harry could speak why you shut your mouth 
 
 perhaps the word weasel had affected ron particularly strongly in any case he was now looking at zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him zacharias flushed 
 
 well all turned up to learn from him and now telling us he really do any of it he said 
 
 not what he said snarled fred 
 
 would you like us to clean out your ears for you enquired greorge pulling a long and metal instrument from inside one of the bags 
 
 or any part of your body really not fussy where we stick this said fred 
 
 yes well said hermione hastily moving on the point is are we agreed we want to take lessons from harry 
 
 there was a murmur of general agreement zacharias folded his arms and said nothing though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in hand 
 
 right said hermione looking relieved that something had at last been settled well then the next question is how often we do it i really think any point in meeting less than once a week 
 
 hang on said angelina we need to make sure this clash with our quidditch practice 
 
 no said cho nor with ours 
 
 nor ours added zacharias smith 
 
 sure we can find a night that suits everyone said hermione slightly impatiently but you know this is rather important talking about learning to defend ourselves against death eaters 
 
 well said barked ernie macmillan who harry had been expecting to speak long before this personally i think this is really important possibly more important than anything else do this year even with our owls coming up 
 
 he looked around impressively as though waiting for people to cry surely not when nobody spoke he went on i personally am at a loss to see why the ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period obviously they are in denial about the return of but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells 
 
 we think the reason umbridge want us trained in defence against the dark arts said hermione is that got some some mad idea that dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army she thinks mobilise us against the ministry 
 
 nearly everybody looked stunned at this news everybody except luna lovegood who piped up well that makes sense after all cornelius fudge has got his own private army 
 
 what said harry completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information 
 
 yes got an army of heliopaths said luna solemnly 
 
 no he snapped hermione 
 
 yes he has said luna 
 
 what are heliopaths asked neville looking blank 
 
 spirits of fire said luna her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of 
 
 they exist neville said hermione tartly 
 
 oh yes they do said luna angrily 
 
 sorry but the proof of that snapped hermione 
 
 there are plenty of accounts just because so you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you 
 
 hem hem said ginny in such a good imitation of professor umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed we trying to decide how often going to meet and have defence lessons 
 
 yes said hermione at once yes we were right ginny 
 
 well once a week sounds cool said lee jordan 
 
 as long as began angelina 
 
 yes yes we know about the quidditch said hermione in a tense voice well the other thing to decide is where going to meet 
 
 this was rather more difficult the whole group fell silent 
 
 library suggested katie bell after a few moments 
 
 i see madam pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library said harry 
 
 maybe an unused classroom said dean 
 
 yeah said ron mcgonagall might let us have hers she did when harry was practising for the tri wizard 
 
 but harry was pretty certain that mcgonagall would not be so accommodating this time for all that hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious 
 
 right well try to find somewhere said hermione send a message round to everybody when got a time and a place for the first meeting 
 
 she rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill then hesitated rather as though she was steeling herself to say something 
 
 ii think everybody should write their name down just so we know who was here but i also think she took a deep breath that we all ought to agree not to shout about what doing so if you sign agreeing not to tell umbridge or anybody else what up to 
 
 fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature but harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list 
 
 er said zacharias slowly not taking the parchment that george was trying to pass to him well sure ernie will tell me when the meeting is 
 
 but ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too hermione raised her eyebrows at him 
 
 iwell we are prefects ernie burst out and if this list was found well i mean to say you said yourself if umbridge finds out 
 
 you just said this group was the most important thing do this year harry reminded him 
 
 iyes said ernie yes i do believe that just 
 
 ernie do you really think leave that list lying around said hermione testily 
 
 no no of course not said ernie looking slightly less anxious iyes of course sign 
 
 nobody raised objections after ernie though harry saw friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name when the last personzacharias had signed hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag there was an odd feeling in the group now it was as though they had just signed some kind of contract 
 
 well ticking on said fred briskly getting to his feet george lee and i have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase be seeing you all later 
 
 in twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too 
 
 cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face but her friend stood beside her arms folded clicking her tongue so that cho had little choice but to leave with her as her friend ushered her through the door cho looked back and waved at harry 
 
 well i think that went quite well said hermione happily as she harry and ron walked out of the head into the bright sunlight a few moments later harry and ron were clutching their bottles of butterbeer 
 
 that zacharias a wart said ron who was glowering after the figure of smith just discernible in the distance 
 
 i like him much either admitted hermione but he overheard me talking to ernie and hannah at the hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming so what could i say but the more people the better reallyi mean michael corner and his friends have come if he been going out with ginny 
 
 ron who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front 
 
 what spluttered ron outraged his ears now resembling curls of raw beef going out withmy goingwhat mean michael corner 
 
 well why he and his friends came i thinkwell obviously interested in learning defence but if ginny told michael what was going on 
 
 when did this when did she 
 
 they met at the yule ball and got together at the end of last year said hermione composedly they had turned into the high street and she paused outside quill shop where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window hmm i could do with a new quill 
 
 she turned into the shop harry and ron followed her 
 
 which one was michael corner ron demanded furiously 
 
 the dark one said hermione 
 
 i like him said ron at once 
 
 big surprise said hermione under her breath 
 
 but said ron following hermione along a row of quills in copper pots i thought ginny fancied harry 
 
 hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head 
 
 ginny used to fancy harry but she gave up on him months ago not that she like you of course she added kindly to harry while she examined a long black and gold quill 
 
 harry whose head was still full of parting wave did not find this subject quite as interesting as ron who was positively quivering with indignation but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered 
 
 so why she talks now he asked hermione she never used to talk in front of me 
 
 exactly said hermione yes i think have this one 
 
 she went up to the counter and handed over fifteen sickles and two knuts with ron still breathing down her neck 
 
 ron she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet this is exactly why ginny told you seeing michael she knew take it badly so harp on about it for sake 
 
 what mean taking anything badly not going to harp on about anything ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street 
 
 hermione rolled her eyes at harry and then said in an undertone while ron was still muttering imprecations about michael corner and talking about michael and ginny what about cho and you 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 it was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the coldhad he been that obvious 
 
 well said hermione smiling slightly she just keep her eyes off you could she 
 
 harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of hogsmeade was 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen a very frosty christmascontents prev chapter next chapter 
 so snape was offering to help him he was definitely offering to help him 
 
 if you ask that once more said harry going to stick this sprout 
 
 only checking said ron they were standing alone at the kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprouts for mrs weasley snow was drifting past the window in front of them 
 
 yes snape was offering to help him said harry he said promised mother to protect him that made an unbreakable oath or something 
 
 an unbreakable vow said ron looking stunned nah he have are you sure 
 
 yes sure said harry why what does it mean 
 
 well you break an unbreakable vow 
 
 worked that much out for myself funnily enough what happens if you break it then 
 
 you die said ron simply fred and george tried to get me to make one when i was about five i nearly did too i was holding hands with fred and everything when dad found us he went mental said ron with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes only time ever seen dad as angry as mum fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since 
 
 yeah well passing over left buttock 
 
 i beg your pardon said voice as the twins entered the kitchen 
 
 aaah george look at this using knives and everything bless them 
 
 be seventeen in two and a bit months time said ron grumpily and then be able to do it by magic 
 
 but meanwhile said george sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a 
 
 you made me do that said ron angrily sucking his cut thumb you wait when seventeen 
 
 sure dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills yawned fred 
 
 and speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills ronald said george what is this we hear from ginny about you and a young lady calledunless our information is faultylavender brown 
 
 ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts mind your own business 
 
 what a snappy retort said fred i really know how you think of them no what we wanted to know was how did it happen 
 
 what mean 
 
 did she have an accident or something 
 
 what 
 
 well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage careful now 
 
 mrs weasley entered the room just in time to see ron throw the sprout knife at fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand 
 
 ron she said furiously you ever let me see you throwing knives again 
 
 i said ron let you see he added under his breath as he turned back to the sprout mountain 
 
 fred george sorry dears but remus is arriving tonight so bill will have to squeeze in with you two 
 
 no problem said george 
 
 then as charlie coming home that just leaves harry and ron in the attic and if fleur shares with ginny 
 
 make christmas muttered fred 
 
 everyone should be comfortable well have a bed anyway said mrs weasley sounding slightly harassed 
 
 percy definitely not showing his ugly face then asked fred 
 
 mrs weasley turned away before she answered 
 
 no busy i expect at the ministry 
 
 or the biggest prat said fred as mrs weasley left the kitchen one of the two well get going then george 
 
 what are you two up to asked ron cant you help us with these sprouts you could just use your wand and then be free too 
 
 no i think we can do that said fred seriously very stuff learning to peel sprouts without magic makes you appreciate how difficult it is for muggles and squibs 
 
 and if you want people to help you ron added george throwing the paper airplane at him i chuck knives at them just a little hint off to the village a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous almost like real magic 
 
 gits said ron darkly watching fred and george setting off across the snowy yard only taken them ten seconds and then we gone too 
 
 i said harry i promised dumbledore i wander off while staying here 
 
 oh yeah said ron he peeled a few more sprouts and then said are you going to tell dumbledore what you heard snape and malfoy saying to each other 
 
 yep said harry going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and top of the list i might have another word with your dad too 
 
 pity you hear what actually doing though 
 
 i have done could i that was the whole point he was refusing to tell snape 
 
 there was silence for a moment or two then ron said course you know what all say dad and dumbledore and all of them say snape really trying to help malfoy he was just trying to find out what up to 
 
 they hear him said harry flatly no that good an actor not even snape 
 
 yeah just saying though said ron 
 
 harry turned to face him frowning 
 
 you think right though 
 
 yeah i do said ron hastily seriously i do but all convinced in the order they 
 
 harry said nothing it had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear hermione now 
 
 obviously harry he was pretending to offer help so he could trick malfoy into telling him what doing 
 
 this was pure imagination however as he had had no opportunity to tell hermione what he had overheard she had disappeared from party before he returned to it or so he had been informed by an irate mclaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room as he and ron had left for the burrow early the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays he was not entirely sure that she had heard him though ron and lavender had been saying a thoroughly goodbye just behind him at the time 
 
 still even hermione would not be able to deny one thing malfoy was definitely up to something and snape knew it so harry felt fully justified in saying i told you so which he had done several times to ron already 
 
 harry did not get the chance to speak to mr weasley who was working very long hours at the ministry until christmas eve night the weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room which ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a explosion fred george harry and ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for christmas dinner stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to his back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet 
 
 they were all supposed to be listening to a christmas broadcast by mrs favorite singer celestina warbeck whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set fleur who seemed to find celestina very dull was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling mrs weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that celestina grew louder and louder under cover of a particularly jazzy number called a cauldron full of hot strong love fred and george started a game of exploding snap with ginny ron kept shooting bill and fleur covert looks as though hoping to pick up tips meanwhile remus lupin who was thinner and more than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear voice 
 
 oh come and stir my cauldron 
 
 and if you do it right 
 
 boil you up some hot strong love 
 
 to keep you warm tonight 
 
 we danced to this when we were eighteen said mrs weasley wiping her eyes on her knitting do you remember arthur 
 
 mphf said mr weasley whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling oh yes marvelous tune 
 
 with an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at harry who was sitting next to him 
 
 sorry about this he said jerking his head toward the wireless as celestina broke into the chorus be over soon 
 
 no problem said harry grinning has it been busy at the ministry 
 
 very said mr weasley i mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrests made in the last couple of months i doubt that one of them is a genuine death eateronly repeat that harry he added quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden 
 
 not still holding stan shunpike are they asked harry 
 
 afraid so said mr weasley i know tried appealing directly to scrimgeour about stan i mean anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that about as much a death eater as this satsuma but the top levels want to look as though making some progress and three arrests sounds better than three mistaken arrests and releases but again this is all top secret 
 
 i say anything said harry he hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say as he marshaled his thoughts celestina warbeck began a ballad called you charmed the heart right out of me 
 
 mr weasley you know what i told you at the station when we were setting off for school 
 
 i checked harry said mr weasley at once i went and searched the malfoys house there was nothing either broken or whole that have been there 
 
 yeah i know i saw in the prophet that looked but this is something different well something more 
 
 and he told mr weasley everything he had overheard between malfoy and snape as harry spoke he saw head turn a little toward him taking in every word when he had finished there was silence except for crooning 
 
 oh my poor heart where has it gone 
 
 left me for a spell 
 
 has it occurred to you harry said mr weasley that snape was simply pretending 
 
 pretending to offer help so that he could find out what up to said harry quickly yeah i thought say that but how do we know 
 
 it our business to know said lupin unexpectedly he had turned his back on the fire now and faced harry across mr weasley business dumbledore trusts severus and that ought to be good enough for all of us 
 
 but said harry just sayjust say wrong about snape 
 
 people have said it many times it comes down to whether or not you trust judgment i do therefore i trust severus 
 
 but dumbledore can make mistakes argued harry he says it himself and you 
 
 he looked lupin straight in the eye 
 
 do you honestly like snape 
 
 i neither like nor dislike severus said lupin no harry i am speaking the truth he added as harry pulled a skeptical expression we shall never be bosom friends perhaps after all that happened between james and sirius and severus there is too much bitterness there but i do not forget that during the year i taught at hogwarts severus made the wolfsbane potion for me every month made it perfectly so that i did not have to suffer as i usually do at the full moon 
 
 but he accidentally let it slip that a werewolf so you had to leave said harry angrily 
 
 lupin shrugged 
 
 the news would have leaked out anyway we both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion he kept me healthy i must be grateful 
 
 maybe he dare mess with the potion with dumbledore watching him said harry 
 
 you are determined to hate him harry said lupin with a faint smile and i understand with james as your father with sirius as your godfather you have inherited an old prejudice by all means tell dumbledore what you have told arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him it might have been on orders that severus questioned draco 
 
 and now torn it quite apart 
 
 thank you to give back my heart 
 
 celestina ended her song on a very long note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which mrs weasley joined in with enthusiastically 
 
 eez eet over said fleur loudly thank goodness what an orrible 
 
 shall we have a nightcap then asked mr weasley loudly leaping to his feet who wants eggnog 
 
 what have you been up to lately harry asked lupin as mr weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation 
 
 oh been underground said lupin almost literally why i been able to write harry sending letters to you would have been something of a 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 been living among my fellows my equals said lupin werewolves he added at look of incomprehension nearly all of them are on side dumbledore wanted a spy and here i was 
 
 he sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on i am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than i however it has been difficult gaining their trust i bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins stealingand sometimes killingto eat 
 
 how come they like voldemort 
 
 they think that under his rule they will have a better life said lupin and it is hard to argue with greyback out there 
 
 greyback 
 
 you heard of him hands closed convulsively in his lap fenrir greyback is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today he regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services greyback specializes in children bite them young he says and raise them away from their parents raise them to hate normal wizards voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon sons and daughters it is a threat that usually produces good results 
 
 lupin paused and then said it was greyback who bit me 
 
 what said harry astonished whenwhen you were a kid you mean 
 
 yes my father had offended him i did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me i even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform but greyback is not like that at the full moon he positions himself close to victims ensuring that he is near enough to strike he plans it all and this is the man voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves i cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against insistence that we werewolves deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people 
 
 but you are normal said harry fiercely just got aa problem 
 
 lupin burst out laughing 
 
 sometimes you remind me a lot of james he called it my furry little problem in company many people were under the impression that i owned a badly behaved rabbit 
 
 he accepted a glass of eggnog from mr weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more cheerful harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking lupin 
 
 have you ever heard of someone called the prince 
 
 the what 
 
 prince said harry watching him closely for signs of recognition 
 
 there are no wizarding princes said lupin now smiling is this a title thinking of adopting i should have thought being the chosen one would be enough 
 
 nothing to do with me said harry indignantly the prince is someone who used to go to hogwarts got his old potions book he wrote spells all over it spells he invented one of them was levicorpus 
 
 oh that one had a great vogue during my time at hogwarts said lupin reminiscently there were a few months in my fifth year when you move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle 
 
 my dad used it said harry i saw him in the pensieve he used it on snape 
 
 he tried to sound casual as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect smile was a little too understanding 
 
 yes he said but he the only one as i say it was very popular you know how these spells come and go 
 
 but it sounds like it was invented while you were at school harry persisted 
 
 not necessarily said lupin jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else he looked into face and then said quietly james was a harry and i promise you he never asked us to call him prince 
 
 abandoning pretense harry said and it sirius or you 
 
 definitely not 
 
 oh harry stared into the fire i just thoughtwell helped me out a lot in potions classes the prince has 
 
 how old is this book harry 
 
 i dunno never checked 
 
 well perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the prince was at hogwarts said lupin 
 
 shortly after this fleur decided to imitate celestina singing a cauldron full of hot strong love which was taken by everyone once they had glimpsed mrs expression to be the cue to go to bed harry and ron climbed all the way up to attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for harry 
 
 ron fell asleep almost immediately but harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of advanced before getting into bed there he turned its pages searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published it was nearly fifty years old neither his father nor his friends had been at hogwarts fifty years ago feeling disappointed harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and snape stan shunpike and the prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children 
 
 got to be joking 
 
 harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed he put on his glasses and looked around the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain 
 
 that asked harry 
 
 from lavender said ron sounding revolted she honestly think wear 
 
 harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words my sweetheart 
 
 nice he said classy you should definitely wear it in front of fred and george 
 
 if you tell them said ron shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow 
 
 stutter at me said harry grinning come on would i 
 
 how could she think like something like that though ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked 
 
 well think back said harry have you ever let it slip that like to go out in public with the words my sweetheart round your neck 
 
 well we really talk much said ron mainly 
 
 snogging said harry 
 
 well yeah said ron he hesitated a moment then said is hermione really going out with mclaggen 
 
 i dunno said harry they were at party together but i think it went that well 
 
 ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking 
 
 presents included a sweater with a large golden snitch worked onto the front by mrs weasley a large box of weasleys wizard wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp package that came with a label reading to master from kreacher 
 
 harry stared at it reckon this is safe to open he asked 
 
 be anything dangerous all our still being searched at the ministry replied ron though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously 
 
 i think of giving kreacher anything do people usually give their christmas presents asked harry prodding the parcel cautiously 
 
 hermione would said ron but wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty 
 
 a moment later harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggots 
 
 nice said ron roaring with laughter very thoughtful 
 
 rather have them than that necklace said harry which sobered ron up at once 
 
 everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for christmas lunch everyone except fleur on whom it appeared mrs weasley had not wanted to waste one and mrs weasley herself who was sporting a midnight blue hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds and a spectacular golden necklace 
 
 fred and george gave them to me they beautiful 
 
 well we find we appreciate you more and more mum now washing our own socks said george waving an airy hand parsnips remus 
 
 harry got a maggot in your hair said ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot 
 
 ow orrible said fleur with an affected little shudder 
 
 yes it said ron gravy fleur 
 
 in his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat 
 
 you are as bad as zat tonks said fleur to ron when she had finished kissing bill in thanks she is always knocking 
 
 i invited dear tonks to come along today said mrs weasley setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at fleur but she come have you spoken to her lately remus 
 
 no i been in contact with anybody very much said lupin but tonks has got her own family to go to she 
 
 hmmm said mrs weasley maybe i got the impression she was planning to spend christmas alone actually 
 
 she gave lupin an annoyed look as though it was all his fault she was getting fleur for a instead of tonks but harry glancing across at fleur who was now feeding bill bits of turkey off her own fork thought that mrs weasley was fighting a battle he was however reminded of a question he had with regard to tonks and who better to ask than lupin the man who knew all about patronuses 
 
 patronus has changed its form he told him snape said so anyway i know that could happen why would your patronus change 
 
 lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly sometimes a great shock an emotional upheaval 
 
 it looked big and it had four legs said harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice hey it be 
 
 arthur said mrs weasley suddenly she had risen from her chair her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window percy 
 
 what 
 
 mr weasley looked around everybody looked quickly at the window ginny stood up for a better look there sure enough was percy weasley striding across the snowy yard his glasses glinting in the sunlight he was not however alone 
 
 arthur with the minister 
 
 and sure enough the man harry had seen in the daily prophet was following along in wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow before any of them could say anything before mr and mrs weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks the back door opened and there stood percy 
 
 there was a painful silence then percy said rather stiffly merry christmas mother 
 
 oh percy said mrs weasley and she threw herself into his arms 
 
 rufus scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene 
 
 you must forgive this intrusion he said when mrs weasley looked around at him beaming and wiping her eyes percy and i were in the vicinityworking you know and he resist dropping in and seeing you all 
 
 but percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family he stood and and stared over everybody heads mr weasley fred and george were all observing him 
 
 please come in sit down minister fluttered mrs weasley straightening her hat have a little purkey or some tooding i mean 
 
 no no my dear molly said scrimgeour harry guessed that he had checked her name with percy before they entered the house i want to intrude be here at all if percy wanted to see you all so badly 
 
 oh perce said mrs weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him 
 
 only looked in for five minutes so have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with percy no no i assure you i want to butt in well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden ah that young finished why he take a stroll with me 
 
 the atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly everybody looked from scrimgeour to harry nobody seemed to find pretense that he did not know name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the minister around the garden when ginny fleur and george also had clean plates 
 
 yeah all right said harry into the silence 
 
 he was not fooled for all talk that they had just been in the area that percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that scrimgeour could speak to harry alone 
 
 fine he said quietly as he passed lupin who had half risen from his chair fine he added as mr weasley opened his mouth to speak 
 
 wonderful said scrimgeour standing back to let harry pass through the door ahead of him just take a turn around the garden and percy and be off carry on everyone 
 
 harry walked across the yard toward the weasleys overgrown garden scrimgeour limping slightly at his side he had harry knew been head of the auror office he looked tough and very different from portly fudge in his bowler hat 
 
 charming said scrimgeour stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants charming 
 
 harry said nothing he could tell that scrimgeour was watching him 
 
 wanted to meet you for a very long time said scrimgeour after a few moments did you know that 
 
 no said harry truthfully 
 
 oh yes for a very long time but dumbledore has been very protective of you said scrimgeour natural of course natural after what been through especially what happened at the ministry 
 
 he waited for harry to say something but harry did not oblige so he went on i have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since i gained office but dumbledore hasmost understandably as i sayprevented this 
 
 still harry said nothing waiting 
 
 the rumors that have flown around said scrimgeour well of course we both know how these stories get distorted all these whispers of a prophecy of you being the chosen one 
 
 they were getting near it now harry thought the reason scrimgeour was here 
 
 i assume that dumbledore has discussed these matters with you 
 
 harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not he looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds and the patch that marked the spot where fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the christmas tree finally he decided on the truth or a bit of it 
 
 yeah discussed it 
 
 have you have you said scrimgeour harry could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron and what has dumbledore told you harry 
 
 sorry but between us said harry 
 
 he kept his voice as pleasant as he could and tone too was light and friendly as he said oh of course if a question of confidences i want you to divulge no no and in any case does it really matter whether you are the chosen one or not 
 
 harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding 
 
 i really know what you mean minister 
 
 well of course to you it will matter enormously said scrimgeour with a laugh but to the wizarding community at large all perception it what people believe important 
 
 harry said nothing he thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he was not going to help scrimgeour get there the gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and harry kept his eyes fixed upon it 
 
 people believe you are the chosen one you see said scrimgeour they think you quite the herowhich of course you arc harry chosen or not how many times have you faced now well anyway he pressed on without waiting for a reply the point is you are a symbol of hope for many harry the idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy naturally it gives people a lift and i help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the ministry and give everyone a boost 
 
 the gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm it was now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground harry was silent so long that scrimgeour said looking from harry to the gnome funny little chaps they but what say you harry 
 
 i exactly understand what you want said harry slowly stand alongside the ministry what does that mean 
 
 oh well nothing at all onerous i assure you said scrimgeour if you were to be seen popping in and out of the ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression and of course while you were there you would have ample opportunity to speak to gawain robards my successor as head of the auror office dolores umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an auror well that could be arranged very easily 
 
 harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so dolores umbridge was still at the ministry was she 
 
 so basically he said as though he just wanted to clarify a few points like to give the impression that working for the ministry 
 
 it would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved harry said scrimgeour sounding relieved that harry had cottoned on so quickly the chosen one you know all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting things are happening 
 
 but if i keep running in and out of the ministry said harry still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly that seem as though i approve of what the up to 
 
 well said scrimgeour frowning slightly well yes partly why like 
 
 no i think work said harry pleasantly you see i like some of the things the doing locking up stan shunpike for instance 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly 
 
 i would not expect you to understand he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as harry had been these are dangerous times and certain measures need to be taken you are sixteen years old 
 
 a lot older than sixteen and he think stan should be in azkaban either said harry making stan a scapegoat just like you want to make me a mascot 
 
 they looked at each other long and hard finally scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth i see you preferlike your hero dumbledoreto disassociate yourself from the ministry 
 
 i want to be used said harry 
 
 some would say your duty to be used by the ministry 
 
 yeah and others might say your duty to check that people really are death eaters before you chuck them in prison said harry his temper rising now doing what barty crouch did you never get it right you people do you either got fudge pretending lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend got the chosen one working for you 
 
 so not the chosen one said scrimgeour 
 
 i thought you said it matter either way said harry with a bitter laugh not to you anyway 
 
 i have said that said scrimgeour quickly it was tactless 
 
 no it was honest said harry one of the only honest things said to me you care whether i live or die but you do care that i help you convince everyone winning the war against voldemort i forgotten minister 
 
 he raised his right fist there shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which dolores umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh i must not tell lies 
 
 i remember you rushing to my defense when i was trying to tell everyone voldemort was back the ministry so keen to be pals last year 
 
 they stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet the gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning against the branches of the rhododendron bush 
 
 what is dumbledore up to said scrimgeour brusquely where does he go when he is absent from hogwarts 
 
 no idea said harry 
 
 and you tell me if you knew said scrimgeour would you 
 
 no i said harry 
 
 well then i shall have to see whether i find out by other means 
 
 you can try said harry indifferently but you seem cleverer than fudge so have thought have learned from his mistakes he tried interfering at hogwarts you might have noticed not minister anymore but still headmaster leave dumbledore alone if i were you 
 
 there was a long pause 
 
 well it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you said scrimgeour his eyes cold and hard behind his glasses man through and through you potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry glad we straightened that out 
 
 and turning his back on the minister of magic he strode back toward the house 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen godrics hollowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 when harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened then he hoped childishly that it had been a dream that ron was still there and had never left yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see rons deserted bunk it was like a dead body in the way it seems to draw his eyes harry jumped down from his own bed keeping his eyes averted from rons hermione who was already busy in the kitchen did not wish harry good morning but turned her face away quickly as he went by hes gone harry told himself hes gone he had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it hes gone and hes not coming back and that was the simple truth of it harry knew because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible once they vacated this spot for ron to find them again he and hermione ate breakfast in silence hermiones eyes were puffy and red she looked as if she had not slept they packed up their things hermione dawdling harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain but no figure appeared between the trees every time harry imitated her looked around for he could not help hoping a little himself and saw nothing but woods another little parcel of fury exploded inside him he could hear ron saying we thought you knew what you were doing and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach 
 
 the muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank they had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay she and harry grasped hands and disapparated reappearing on a windswept hillside the instant they arrived hermione dropped harrys hand and walked away from him finally sitting down on a large rock her face on her knees shaking with what he knew were sobs he watched her supposing that he ought to go and comfort her but something kept him rooted to the spot everything inside him felt cold and tight again he saw the contemptuous expression on rons face harry strode off through the heather walking in a large circle with the distraught hermione at its center casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection 
 
 they did not discuss ron at all over the next few days harry was determined never to mention his name again and hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping he would hear her crying meanwhile harry had started bringing out the marauders map and examining it by wandlight he was waiting for the moment when rons labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of hogwarts proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle protected by his status of pureblood however ron did not appear on the map and after a while harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at ginnys name in the girls dormitory wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep that she would somehow know he was thinking about her hoping that she was all right 
 
 by day they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of gryffindors sword but the more they talked about the places in which dumbledore might have hidden it the more desperate and their speculation became cudgel his brains though he might harry could not remember dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something there were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with ron or with dumbledore we thought you knew what you were doingwe thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan 
 
 he could not hide it from himself ron had been right dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing they had discovered one horcrux but they had no means of destroying it the others were as unattainable as they had ever been hopelessness threatened to engulf him he was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends offers to accompany him on this meandering pointless journey he knew nothing he had no ideas and he was constantly painfully on the alert for any indications that hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough that she was leaving 
 
 they were spending many evenings in near silence and hermione took to bringing out phineas nigelluss portrait and propping it up in a chair as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by rons departure despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again phineas nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what harry was up to and consented to reappear blindfolded every few days of so harry was even glad to see him because he was company albeit of a snide and taunting kind they relished any news about what was happening at hogwarts though phineas nigellus was not an ideal informer he venerated snape the first slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about snape or phineas nigellus would instantly leave his painting 
 
 however he did let drop certain snippets snape seemed to be facing a constant low level of mutiny from a hard core of students ginny had been banned from going into hogsmeade snape had reinstated umbridges old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies from all of these things harry deduced that ginny and probably neville and luna along with her had been doing their best to continue dumbledores army this scant news made harry want to see ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache but it also made him think of ron again and of dumbledore and of hogwarts itself which he missed nearly as much as his indeed as phineas niggellus talked about snapes crackdown harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of snapes regime being fed and having a soft bad and other people being in charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment but then he remembered that he was undesirable number one that there was a galleon price on his head and that to walk into hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the ministry of magic indeed phineas nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about harry and hermiones whereabouts hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this and phineas nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious 
 
 the weather grew colder and colder they did not dare remain in any area too long so rather than staying in the south of england where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries they continued to meander up and down the country braving a mountainside where sleet pounded the tent a wide flat marsh where the tent was flooded with chill water and a tiny island in the middle of a scottish loch where snow half buried the tent in the night they had already spotted christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when harry resolved to suggest again what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them they had just eaten an unusually good meal hermione had been to a supermarket under the invisibility cloak scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left and harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti bolognese and tinned pears 
 
 he had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours break from wearing the horcrux which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him 
 
 hermione 
 
 hmm she was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with the tales of beedle the bard he could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book which was not after all very long but evidently she was still deciphering something in it because spellmans syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair 
 
 harry cleared his throat he felt exactly as he had done on the occasion several years previously when he had asked professor mcgonagall whether he could go into hogsmeade despite the fact that he had not persuaded the dursleys to sign his permission slip 
 
 hermione ive been thinking and c 
 
 harry could you help me with something 
 
 apparently she had not been listening to him she leaned forward and held out the tales of beedle the bard 
 
 look at that symbol she said pointing to the top of a page above what harry assumed was the title of the story being unable to read runes he could not be sure there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye its pupil crossed with a vertical line 
 
 i never took ancient runes hermione 
 
 i know that but it isnt a rune and its not in the syllabary either all along i thought it was a picture of an eye but i dont think it is its been inked in look somebodys drawn it there it isnt really part of the book think have you ever seen it before 
 
 no no wait a moment harry looked closer isnt it the same symbol lunas dad was wearing round his neck 
 
 well thats what i thought too 
 
 then its grindelwalds mark 
 
 she stared at him openmouthed 
 
 what 
 
 krum told me 
 
 he recounted the story that viktor krum had told him at the wedding hermione looked astonished 
 
 grindelwalds mark 
 
 she looked from harry to the weird symbol and back again ive never heard that grindelwald had a mark theres no mention of it in anything ive ever read about him 
 
 well like i say krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at durmstrang and grindelwald put it there 
 
 she fell back into the old armchair frowning 
 
 thats very odd if its a symbol of dark magic whats it doing in a book of childrens stories 
 
 yeah it is weird said harry and youd think scrimgeour would have recognized it he was minister he ought to have been expert on dark stuff 
 
 i know perhaps he thought it was an eye just like i did all the other stories have little pictures over the titles 
 
 she did not speak but continued to pore over the strange mark harry tried again 
 
 hermione 
 
 hmm 
 
 ive been thinking i c i want to go to godrics hollow 
 
 she looked up at him but her eyes were unfocused and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book 
 
 yes she said yes ive been wondering that too i really think well have to 
 
 did you hear me right he asked 
 
 of course i did you want to go to godrics hollow i agree i think we should i mean i cant think of anywhere else it could be either itll be dangerous but the more i think about it the more likely it seems its there 
 
 er c whats there asked harry 
 
 at that she looked just as bewildered as he felt 
 
 well the sword harry dumbledore must have known youd want to go back there and i mean godrics hollow is godric gryffindors birthplace c 
 
 really gryffindor came from godrics hollow 
 
 harry did you ever even open a history of magic 
 
 erm he said smiling for what felt like the first time in months the muscles in his face felt oddly stiff i mightve opened it you know when i bought it just the once 
 
 well as the village is named after him id have thought you might have made the connection said hermione she sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library theres a bit about the village in a history of magic wait 
 
 she opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook a history of magic by bathilda bagshot which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted 
 
 
 
 
 upon the signature of the international statute of secrecy in wizards went into hiding for good it was natural perhaps that they formed their own small communities within a community many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families who banded together for mutual support and protection the villages of tinworsh in cornwall upper flagley in yorkshire and ottery st catchpole on the south coast of england were notable homes to knots of wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes confunded muggles most celebrated of these dwelling places is perhaps godrics hollow the west country village where the great wizard godric gryffindor was born and where bowman wright wizarding smith forged the first golden snitch the graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families and this accounts no doubt for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries 
 
 
 
 
 you and your parents arent mentioned hermione said closing the book because professor bagshot doesnt cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century but you see godrics hollow godric gryffindor gryffindors sword dont you think dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to godrics hollow for him the lore of the village lay in his parents graves the house where he had narrowly escaped death and in the person of bathilda bagshot 
 
 remember what muriel said he asked eventually 
 
 who 
 
 you know he hesitated he did not want to say rons name ginnys at the wedding the one who said you had skinny ankles 
 
 oh said hermione it was a sticky moment harry knew that she had sensed rons name in the offing he rushed on 
 
 she said bathilda bagshot still lived in godrics hollow 
 
 bathilda bagshot murmured hermione running her index finger over bathildas embossed name on the front cover of a history of magic well i suppose c 
 
 she gasped so dramatically that harrys insides turned over he drew his wand looking around at the entrance half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap but there was nothing there 
 
 what he said half angry half relieved what did you do that for i thought youd seen a death eater unzipping the tent at least c 
 
 harry what if bathildas got the sword what if dumbledore entrusted it to her 
 
 harry considered this possibility bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now and according to muriel she was gaga was it likely that dumbledore would have hidden the sword of gryffindor with her if so harry felt that dumbledore had left a great deal to chance dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with bathilda now however was not the moment to cast doubt on hermiones theory not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with harrys dearest wish 
 
 yeah he might have done so are we going to go to godrics hollow 
 
 yes but well have to think it through carefully harry she was sitting up now and harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his well need to practice disapparating together under the invisibility cloak for a start and perhaps disillusionment charms would be sensible too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use polyjuice potion in that case well need to collect hair from somebody i actually think wed better do that harry the thicker our disguises the better 
 
 harry let her talk nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause but his mind had left the conversation for the first time since he had discovered that the sword in gringotts was a fake he felt excited 
 
 he was about to go home about to return to the place where he had had a family it was in godrics hollow that but for voldemort he would have grown up and spent every school holiday he could have invited friends to his house he might even have had brothers and sisters it would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake the life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him after hermione had gone to bed that night harry quietly extracted his rucksack from hermiones beaded bag and from inside it the photograph album hagrid had given him so long ago for the first time in months he perused the old pictures of his parents smiling and waving up at him from the images which were all he had left of them now 
 
 harry would gladly have set out for godrics hollow the following day but hermione had other ideas convinced as she was that voldemort would expect harry to return to the scene of his parents deaths she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible it was therefore a full week later c once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent muggles who were christmas shopping and had practiced apparating and disapparating while underneath the invisibility cloak together c that hermione agreed to make the journey 
 
 they were to apparate to the village under cover of darkness so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed polyjuice potion harry transforming into a balding muggle man hermione into his small and rather mousy wife the beaded bag containing all of their possessions apart from the horcrux which harry was wearing around his neck was tucked into an inside pocket of hermiones coat harry lowered the invisibility cloak over them then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again 
 
 heart beating in his throat harry opened his eyes they were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the nights first stars were already glimmering feebly cottages stood on either side of the narrow road christmas decorations twinkling in their windows a short way ahead of them a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village 
 
 all this snow hermione whispered beneath the cloak why didnt we think of snow after all our precautions well leave prints well just have to get rid of them c you go in front ill do it c 
 
 harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces 
 
 lets take off the cloak said harry and when she looked frightened oh come on we dont look like us and theres no one around 
 
 he stowed the cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages any one of them might have been the one in which james and lily had once lived or where bathilda lived now harry gazed at the front doors their roofs and their front porches wondering whether he remembered any of them knowing deep inside that it was impossible that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever he was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all he did not know what happened when the subjects of a fidelius charm died then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village a small square was revealed to them 
 
 strung all around with colored lights there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle partly obscured by a windblown christmas tree there were several shops a post office a pub and a little church whose windows were glowing across the square 
 
 the snow here had become impacted it was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day villagers were crisscrossing in front of them their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps they heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed then they heard a carol start up inside the little church 
 
 harry i think its christmas eve said hermione 
 
 is it 
 
 he had lost track of the date they had not seen a newspaper for weeks 
 
 im sure it is said hermione her eyes upon the church they theyll be in there wont they your mum and dad i can see the graveyard behind it 
 
 harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement more like fear now that he was so near he wondered whether he wanted to see after all perhaps hermione knew how he was feeling because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time pulling him forward halfway across the square however she stopped dead 
 
 harry look 
 
 she was pointing at the war memorial as they had passed it it had transformed instead of an obelisk covered in names there was a statue of three people a man with untidy hair and glasses a woman with long hair and a kind pretty face and a baby boy sitting in his mothers arms snow lay upon all their heads like fluffy white caps 
 
 harry drew closer gazing up into his parents faces he had never imagined that there would be a statue how strange it was to see himself represented in stone a happy baby without a scar on his forehead 
 
 cmon said harry when he had looked his fill and they turned again toward the church as they crossed the road he glanced over his shoulder the statue had turned back into the war memorial 
 
 the singing grew louder as they approached the church it made harrys throat constrict it reminded him so forcefully of hogwarts of peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor of the great halls twelve christmas trees of dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker of ron in a sweater 
 
 there was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it on either side of the slippery path to the church doors the snow lay deep and untouched they moved off through the snow carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows 
 
 behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red gold and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket harry moved toward the nearest grave 
 
 look at this its an abbott could be some relation of hannahs 
 
 keep your voice down hermione begged him 
 
 they waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them stooping to peer at the words on old headstones every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied 
 
 harry here 
 
 hermione was two rows of tombstones away he had to wade back to her his heart positively banging in his chest 
 
 is it c 
 
 no but look 
 
 she pointed to the dark stone harry stooped down and saw upon the frozen granite the words kendra dumbledore and a short way down her dates of birth and death and her daughter ariana there was also a quotation 
 
 where your treasure is there will your heart be also 
 
 so rita skeeter and muriel had got some of their facts right the dumbledore family had indeed lived here and part of it had died here 
 
 seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it harry could not help thinking that he and dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard and that dumbledore ought to have told him so yet he had never thought to share the connection they could have visited the place together for a moment harry imagined coming here with dumbledore of what a bond that would have been of how much it would have meant to him but it seemed that to dumbledore the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence irrelevant perhaps to the job he wanted harry to do 
 
 hermione was looking at harry and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow he read the words on the tombstone again where your treasure is there will your heart be also he did not understand what these words meant surely dumbledore had chosen them as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died 
 
 are you sure he never mentioned c hermione began 
 
 no said harry curtly then lets keep looking and he turned away wishing he had not seen the stone he did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment 
 
 here cried hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness oh no sorry i thought it said potter 
 
 she was rubbing at a crumbling mossy stone gazing down at it a little frown on her face 
 
 harry come back a moment 
 
 he did not want to be sidetracked again and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her 
 
 what 
 
 look at this 
 
 the grave was extremely old weathered so that harry could hardly make out the name hermione showed him the symbol beneath it 
 
 harry thats the mark in the book 
 
 he peered at the place she indicated the stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name 
 
 yeah it could be 
 
 hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone 
 
 it says ig c ignotus i think 
 
 im going to keep looking for my parents all right harry told her a slight edge to his voice and he set off again leaving her crouched beside the old grave 
 
 every now and then he recognized a surname that like abbott he had met at hogwarts sometimes there were several generations of the same wizarding family represented in the graveyard harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out or the current members had moved away from godrics hollow deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation 
 
 the darkness and the silence seemed to become all of a sudden much deeper harry looked around worried thinking of dementors then realized that the carols had finished that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights 
 
 then hermiones voice came out of the blackness for the third time sharp and clear from a few yards away 
 
 harry theyre here right here 
 
 and he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time he moved toward her feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest the same sensation he had had right after dumbledore had died a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs 
 
 the headstone was only two rows behind kendra and arianas it was made of white marble just like dumbledores tomb and this made it easy to read as it seemed to shine in the dark harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it 
 
 
 
 
 james potter lily potter 
 born march born january 
 died october died october 
 
 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 
 
 harry read the words slowly as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning and he read the last of them aloud 
 
 the last enemy that shall be defeated is death a horrible thought came to him and with a kind of panic isnt that a death eater idea why is that there 
 
 it doesnt mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it harry said hermione her voice gentle it means you know living beyond death living after death 
 
 but they were not living thought harry they were gone the empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone indifferent unknowing and tears came before he could stop them boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending he let them fall his lips pressed hard together looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of lily and james lay bones now surely or dust not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near his heart still beating alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing at this moment that he was sleeping under the snow with them 
 
 hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly he could not look at her but returned the pressure now taking deep sharp gulps of the night air trying to steady himself trying to regain control he should have brought something o give them and he had not thought of it and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen but hermione raised her wand moved it in a circle through the air and a wreath of christmas roses blossomed before them harry caught it and laid it on his parents grave 
 
 as soon as he stood up he wanted to leave he did not think he could stand another moment there he put his arm around hermiones shoulders and she put hers around his waist and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow past dumbledores mother and sister back toward the dark church and the kissing gate

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 in a thousand years 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 yes in a thousand years people will fly on the wings of steam 
 through the air over the ocean the young inhabitants of america will 
 become visitors of old europe they will come over to see the 
 monuments and the great cities which will then be in ruins just as 
 we in our time make pilgrimages to the tottering splendors of southern asia in a thousand years they will come 
 
 the thames the danube and the rhine still roll their course 
 mont blanc stands firm with its summit and the northern lights gleam over the land of the north but generation after 
 generation has become dust whole rows of the mighty of the moment are forgotten like those who already slumber under the hill on which 
 the rich trader whose ground it is has built a bench on which he 
 can sit and look out across his waving corn fields 
 
 to europe cry the young sons of america to the land of our 
 ancestors the glorious land of monuments and fancy to europe 
 the ship of the air comes it is crowded with passengers for 
 the transit is quicker than by sea the wire under 
 the ocean has already telegraphed the number of the aerial caravan 
 europe is in sight it is the coast of ireland that they see but 
 the passengers are still asleep they will not be called till they are 
 exactly over england there they will first step on european shore in 
 the land of shakespeare as the educated call it in the land of 
 politics the land of machines as it is called by others 
 
 here they stay a whole day that is all the time the busy race can 
 devote to the whole of england and scotland then the journey is 
 continued through the tunnel under the english channel to france the land of charlemagne and napoleon moliere is named the learned men talk of the classic school of remote antiquity there is rejoicing and shouting for the names of heroes poets and men of science whom our time does not know but who will be born after our time in 
 paris the centre of europe and elsewhere 
 
 the air steamboat flies over the country whence columbus went 
 forth where cortez was born and where calderon sang dramas in 
 sounding verse beautiful women live still in the 
 blooming valleys and the oldest songs speak of the cid and the 
 alhambra 
 
 then through the air over the sea to italy where once lay 
 old everlasting rome it has vanished the campagna lies desert a 
 single ruined wall is shown as the remains of st but there 
 is a doubt if this ruin be genuine 
 
 next to greece to sleep a night in the grand hotel at the top 
 of mount olympus to say that they have been there and the journey is continued to the bosphorus to rest there a few hours and see the 
 place where byzantium lay and where the legend tells that the harem 
 stood in the time of the turks poor fishermen are now spreading their nets 
 
 over the remains of mighty cities on the broad danube cities 
 which we in our time know not the travellers pass but here and 
 there on the rich sites of those that time shall bring forth the 
 caravan sometimes descends and departs thence again 
 
 down below lies germany that was once covered with a close net of 
 railway and canals the region where luther spoke where goethe 
 sang and mozart once held the sceptre of harmony great names shine there in science and in art names that are unknown to us one day devoted to seeing germany and one for the north the country of oersted and linnaeus and for norway the land of the old heroes and the young normans iceland is visited on the journey home the geysers burn no more hecla is an extinct volcano but the rocky island is still fixed in the midst of the foaming sea a continual monument of legend and poetry 
 
 there is really a great deal to be seen in europe says the 
 young american and we have seen it in a week according to the 
 directions of the great traveller and here he mentions the name of 
 one of his contemporaries in his celebrated work how to see all 
 europe in a week

 ext prison yard day 
 andy strolls along whistling softly hands in both pockets tilt down to his pantleg concrete grit trickles out 
 red 
 it turns out favorite hobby was totin his wall out into the 
 exercise yard a handful at a time 
 int nd tier night 
 a guard strolls the tier shining his flashlight into the cells he pauses at bars playing the beam over the sleeping form huddled under the blankets 
 p reverse angle from cell 
 we see what the guard instead of head under the blanket a pillow the flashlight plays across the cell pinning marilyn monroe in a circle of light 
 angle from behind poster 
 the light illuminates her face through the paper widen to reveal andy lying in his tunnel holding his breath the light clicks off the footsteps move on he gets back to work 
 red 
 while the rest of us slept andy spent years workin the nightshift 
 int shaft night 
 booming slowly up the shaft rats scurry the pipes suddenly a piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets down the shaft as the pushes through the pick withdraws replaced by peering eye 
 a series of dissolves through 
 takes us through the widening of the hole first as big as a tea cup then a saucer then a dinner plate 
 red 
 probably took him most of a year just to get his head through 
 andy finally gets his head through scraping his ears got a penlight clenched in his teeth he peers down into the shaft at the very bottom maybe feet down a big ceramic pipe runs the length of the cellblock beneath its coat of grime and dust the word sewer is stenciled 
 ext loading dock access night 
 angle looking straight down below us tommy williams lies facedown at feet blood is spreading fanning out of the pavement norton turns strolls out of frame 
 red 
 i guess after tommy was killed andy decided been here just 
 about long enough 
 again we see andy working norton pokes his head in 
 norton 
 i wanna get home 
 andy 
 just about done sir 
 norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial his back turned this time though we stay on andy 
 he pulls up his sweater yanks out a large black book and a stack of files lays them on the desk he then grabs the real ledger and files jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down he picks up the bogus stack crosses to norton and shoves everything in 
 int hallway night 
 norton exits his office and strolls off whistling push in on the open door we see andy at the desk pulling dress shoes from their box 
 red 
 andy did like he was told buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine 
 int office minutes later 
 andy sorts through three suits he pauses checking the gray pinstripe nice 
 int cellblock five night

 tilt down as he passes by yep wearing shoes 
 int cell night 
 the lights go out andy places the last chess piece gazes up at racquel smiles pulls the rope from under his pillow he stands and unbuttons his prison shirt revealing gray pinstripe suit underneath a flash of lightning floods the cell throwing wild shadows 
 int cell night 
 the storm rages andy naked carefully slips folded suit into a large industrial bag next to go in are the shoes chess pieces already in a smaller bag black ledger en files last but not least a bar of soap wrapped in a towel 
 int tunnel night 
 andy again wearing prison clothes inches down the tunnel 
 int shaft night 
 andy squeezes through the hole emerges to the waist he reaches for the opposite wall manages to snag a steel conduit with his fingers 
 suddenly a huge rat darts for his hand andy yanks away and almost plummets down the shaft he dangles wildly for a moment arms windmilling then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall the rat scurries off pissed 
 andy snags the conduit again he contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft we now see the purpose for the rope the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack 
 he kicks his legs across the shaft gets his feet braced wit his back against one wall and feet against the other he starts down the shaft sliding dangerously using pipes for handholds flinching as rats dart this way and that scurrying in the shadows he drops the last few feet to the bottom 
 he approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it pulls out the and says a quick silent prayer raises the high and swings it down with all his might once twice third time lucky an enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if the mount st helens of shit andy is instantly coated black he turns away and heaves his guts out the shit keeps coming 
 int sewer pipe night 
 andy peers down through the hole playing his penlight aroun the inside diameter is no more than two feet tight squeeze coated with crud it seems to go on for miles 
 no turning back he wriggles into the pipe and starts crawling plastic bag dragging behind 
 red 
 andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of 
 foulness i even imagine or maybe i just want to 
 ext field night 
 rain is falling in solid sheets shawshank is half a mile distant boom down to reveal the push in toward the mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it 
 red 
 five hundred yards the length of five football fields just shy of half a mile 
 fingers appear thrusting through the wire mesh covering the mouth of the pipe face looms from the darkness peering out at freedom he wrenches the mesh loose pushes himself out and plunges into the creek he comes up sputtering for breath the water is 
 he wades upstream ripping his clothes from his body he gets his shirt off spins it through the air over his head flings the shirt away he raises his arms to the sky turning slowly feeling the rain washing him clean exultant triumphant a flash of lightning arcs from horizon to horizon

 an ancient salon 
 when m gillenormand lived in the rue servandoni he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons 
 although a bourgeois m gillenormand was received in society 
 as he had a double measure of wit in the first place that which was born with him and secondly that which was attributed to him he was even sought out and made much of 
 he never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there 
 there are people who will have influence at any price and who will have other people busy themselves over them when they cannot be oracles they turn wags m gillenormand was not of this nature his domination in the royalist salons which he frequented cost his nothing he was an oracle everywhere 
 it had happened to him to hold his own against m de bonald and even against m 
 about he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood in the rue ferou with madame la baronne de t a worthy and respectable person whose husband had been ambassador of france to berlin under louis xvi 
 baron de t who during his lifetime had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions had died bankrupt during the emigration leaving as his entire fortune some very curious memoirs about mesmer and his tub in ten manuscript volumes bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges madame de t had not published the memoirs out of pride and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how 
 madame de t lived far from the court a very mixed society as she said in a noble isolation proud and poor 
 a few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth and these constituted a purely royalist salon 
 they sipped tea there and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century the charter the bonapartists the prostitution of the blue ribbon or the jacobinism of louis xviii according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by monsieur afterwards charles x 
 the songs of the fishwomen in which napoleon was called nicolas were received there with transports of joy 
 duchesses the most delicate and charming women in the world went into ecstasies over couplets like the following addressed to the federates refoncez dans vos culottes 
 le bout d chemis qui vous pend 
 n dis pas qu les patriotes 
 ont arbore l drapeau blanc 
 tuck into your trousers the that is hanging out let it not be said that patriots have hoisted the white flag 
 there they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous with quatrains with distiches even thus upon the dessolles ministry a moderate cabinet of which mm 
 decazes and deserre were raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base 
 il faut changer de sol et de serre et de case 
 in order to the shaken throne firmly on its base soil des solles greenhouse and house decazes must be changed 
 or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers an abominably jacobin chamber and from this list they combined alliances of names in such a manner as to form for example phrases like the following damas 
 sabran 
 this was done merrily in that society they parodied the revolution 
 they used i know not what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense they sang their little ca ira ah ca ira ca ira ca ira 
 les bonapartistes a la lanterne 
 songs are like the guillotine they chop away indifferently this head that 
 it is only a variation 
 in the fualdes affair which belongs to this epoch they took part for bastide and jausion because fualdes was a buonapartist they designated the liberals as friends and brothers this constituted the most deadly insult 
 like certain church towers madame de salon had two cocks one of them was m gillenormand the other was comte de of whom it was whispered about with a sort of respect 
 do you know that is the lamothe of the affair of the necklace 
 these singular amnesties do occur in parties 
 let us add the following 
 in the bourgeoisie honored situations decay through too easy relations one must beware whom one admits in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons 
 the ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law as above every other 
 marigny the brother of the pompadour had his entry with m le prince de soubise in spite of 
 no because 
 du barry the of the vaubernier was very welcome at the house of m le marechal de richelieu this society is olympus 
 mercury and the prince de guemenee are at home there 
 a thief is admitted there provided he be a god 
 the comte de lamothe who in was an old man years of age had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air his cold and angular face his perfectly polished manners his coat buttoned up to his cravat and his long legs always crossed in long flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna his face was the same color as his trousers 
 this m de lamothe was held in consideration in this salon on account of his celebrity and strange to say though true because of his name of valois 
 as for m gillenormand his consideration was of absolutely quality 
 he had in spite of his levity and without its interfering in any way with his dignity a certain manner about him which was imposing dignified honest and lofty in a bourgeois fashion and his great age added to it 
 one is not a century with impunity the years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment 
 in addition to this he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock 
 thus when the king of prussia after having restored louis xviii came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the count de ruppin he was received by the descendant of louis xiv somewhat as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg and with the most delicate impertinence 
 m gillenormand approved 
 all kings who are not the king of france said he are provincial kings one day the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence 
 to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned 
 to be suspended 
 sus is superfluous observed m gillenormand remarks of this nature found a situation 
 suspendu suspended pendu hung 
 at the te deum on the anniversary of the return of the bourbons he said on seeing m de talleyrand pass by 
 there goes his excellency the evil one 
 m gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter that tall mademoiselle who was over forty and looked fifty and by a handsome little boy of seven years white rosy fresh with happy and trusting eyes who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him 
 how handsome he is what a pity 
 poor child 
 this child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago 
 he was called poor child because he had for a father a brigand of the loire 
 this brigand of the loire was m who has already been mentioned and whom m gillenormand called the disgrace of his family

 chapter iii 
 
 the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that responsibility himself 
 the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybody tired of waiting prepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending 
 in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by his this idea was eagerly received the emperor gave his consent the collected money by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a landowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the fete and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and fireworks at zakret count country seat 
 the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his at country house 
 it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of beauty the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance 
 boris drubetskoy having left his wife in moscow and being for the present en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and boris had only recently married they met as good friends of long standing 
 at midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris they were the third couple boris coolly looking at dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark gauze gown talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter 
 as the mazurka began boris saw that adjutant general balashev one of those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the face he took balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him boris noticed excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself 
 but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them 
 all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two ladies he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashev and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were moving toward the door boris fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head 
 the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words 
 to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that boris had overheard it 
 let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown 
 boris understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor the ballroom and remained there about another 
 boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their estimation 
 the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home at two that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil 
 next day the following letter was sent to napoleon 
 monsieur mon frere 
 yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty which i have kept my engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc

 chapter ii 
 
 one of the red spectres of that epoch 
 any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at this epoch and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge which will soon be succeeded let us hope by some hideous iron cable bridge might have observed had he dropped his eyes over the parapet a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon was sewn shod with wooden sabots tanned by the sun his face nearly black and his hair nearly white a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek bowed bent prematurely aged who walked nearly every day hoe and sickle in hand in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge and border the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say were they much larger 
 these are gardens and were they a little smaller these are bouquets 
 all these enclosures abut upon the river at one end and on a house at the other 
 the man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 
 he lived there alone and solitary silently and poorly with a woman who was neither young nor old neither homely nor pretty neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise who served him the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there these flowers were his occupation 
 by dint of labor of perseverance of attention and of buckets of water he had succeeded in creating after the creator and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature 
 he was ingenious he had forestalled soulange bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from america and china 
 he was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting hoeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass of which the sun made a carbuncle 
 his table was very plain and he drank more milk than wine 
 a child could make him give way and his servant scolded him 
 he was so timid that be seemed shy he rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure the abbe mabeuf a good old man nevertheless if the inhabitants of the town or strangers or any chance comers curious to see his tulips rang at his little cottage he opened his door with a smile 
 he was the brigand of the loire 
 any one who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name of georges pontmercy 
 when very young this georges pontmercy had been a soldier in regiment 
 the revolution broke out regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy and were only divided into brigades in 
 pontmercy fought at spire at worms at neustadt at turkheim at alzey at mayence where he was one of the two hundred who formed rearguard 
 it was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the prince of hesse behind the old rampart of andernach and only rejoined the main body of the army when the cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis 
 he was under kleber at marchiennes and at the battle of where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm 
 then he passed to the frontier of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert 
 joubert was appointed its and pontmercy pontmercy was by side in the midst of the of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say 
 berthier has been cannoneer cavalier and grenadier he beheld his old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted sabre he was shouting 
 forward 
 having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign on board a pinnace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast he fell into a of seven or eight english vessels the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea to hide the soldiers between decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel 
 pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea in he was in that malher division which took gunzberg from the archduke ferdinand 
 at weltingen he received into his arms beneath a storm of bullets colonel maupetit mortally wounded at the head of the th dragoons 
 he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the fire when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the th of the line pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard 
 the emperor gave him the cross pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua melas and alexandria mack at ulm made prisoners in succession 
 he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier commanded and which captured hamburg then he was transferred to the th of the line which was the old regiment of flanders 
 at eylau he was in the cemetery where for the space of two hours the heroic captain louis hugo the uncle of the author of this book sustained alone with his company of men every effort of the hostile army pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery he was at friedland 
 then he saw moscow 
 then la beresina then lutzen bautzen dresden wachau leipzig and the defiles of gelenhausen then montmirail craon the banks of the marne the banks of the aisne and the redoubtable position of laon at being then a captain he put ten cossacks to the sword and saved not his general but his corporal 
 he was well slashed up on this occasion and splinters were extracted from his left arm alone 
 eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry he had what was called under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier or a squadron or a battalion as an officer 
 it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both and infantry at one and the same time he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba 
 at waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers in dubois brigade 
 it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion 
 he came and cast the flag at the feet 
 he was covered with blood while tearing down the banner he had received a across his face 
 the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him 
 you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor pontmercy replied 
 sire i thank you for my widow 
 an hour later he fell in the ravine of ohain 
 now who was this georges pontmercy he was this same brigand of the loire 
 we have already seen something of his history 
 after waterloo pontmercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire 
 the restoration had placed him on then had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon king louis xviii regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grade of colonel nor his title of baron 
 he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pontmercy he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile 
 i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand 
 then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette 
 they dared not interfere with him two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pontmercy 
 he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken 
 at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte 
 pontmercy had ended may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor 
 in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius and who had a little of spirit 
 one day he encountered the in one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said 
 mr crown attorney am i permitted to wear my scar 
 he had nothing save his meagre as chief of squadron he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon he lived there alone we have just seen how 
 under the empire between two wars he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sigh saying 
 the greatest families are forced into it in madame pontmercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child 
 this child had been the joy in his solitude but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him 
 the father had yielded in the little interest and had transferred his love to flowers 
 moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired 
 he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz 
 m gillenormand kept up no relations with his the colonel was a bandit to him 
 m gillenormand never mentioned the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship 
 it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited for the gillenormands pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague they intended to bring up the child in their own way 
 perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself 
 the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal side and her son was her natural heir 
 the boy whose name was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more no one opened his mouth to him about it 
 nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little mind he had finally understood something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart 
 while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his ban and went and posted himself at at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster 
 from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m mabeuf 
 that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes 
 that man who had so manly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung to his mind 
 one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other 
 this visit led to others 
 the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his future this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure 
 and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same 
 the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference 
 twice a year on the first of january and on st day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread

 it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both and infantry at one and the same time he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba 
 at waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers in dubois brigade 
 it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion 
 he came and cast the flag at the feet 
 he was covered with blood while tearing down the banner he had received a across his face 
 the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him 
 you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor pontmercy replied 
 sire i thank you for my widow 
 an hour later he fell in the ravine of ohain 
 now who was this georges pontmercy he was this same brigand of the loire 
 we have already seen something of his history 
 after waterloo pontmercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire 
 the restoration had placed him on then had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon king louis xviii regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grade of colonel nor his title of baron 
 he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pontmercy he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile 
 i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand 
 then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette 
 they dared not interfere with him two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pontmercy 
 he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken 
 at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte 
 pontmercy had ended may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor 
 in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius and who had a little of spirit 
 one day he encountered the in one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said 
 mr crown attorney am i permitted to wear my scar 
 he had nothing save his meagre as chief of squadron he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon he lived there alone we have just seen how 
 under the empire between two wars he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sigh saying 
 the greatest families are forced into it in madame pontmercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child 
 this child had been the joy in his solitude but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him 
 the father had yielded in the little interest and had transferred his love to flowers 
 moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired 
 he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz 
 m gillenormand kept up no relations with his the colonel was a bandit to him 
 m gillenormand never mentioned the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship 
 it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited for the gillenormands pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague they intended to bring up the child in their own way 
 perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself 
 the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal side and her son was her natural heir 
 the boy whose name was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more no one opened his mouth to him about it 
 nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little mind he had finally understood something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart 
 while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his ban and went and posted himself at at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster 
 from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m mabeuf 
 that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes 
 that man who had so manly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung to his mind 
 one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other 
 this visit led to others 
 the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his future this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure 
 and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same 
 the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference 
 twice a year on the first of january and on st day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread

 book nine 
 chapter iv 
 
 at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to napoleon 
 having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels 
 a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace 
 the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse advanced his chest against balashev put his hand to his saber and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general 
 after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashev found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself 
 the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising in water 
 balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time 
 a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked smart and well kept 
 it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign 
 the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood importance he led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the quarters were he believed not far off 
 they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his destination 
 the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure 
 they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man rode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine 
 balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the bracelets plunies necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in fact murat now called king of naples though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from that city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians called out to him viva il re he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said poor fellows they know that i am leaving them tomorrow 
 long live the king 
 but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had been ordered to return to military service and especially since his last interview with napoleon in danzig when his august had told him i made you king that you should reign in my way but not in yours he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business and like a but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of poland without himself knowing why or whither 
 on seeing the russian general he threw back his head with its long hair curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his majesty of mission whose name he could not pronounce 
 de said the king overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly condescension 
 as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of familiarity he laid his hand on the withers of horse and said 
 well general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge 
 your majesty replied balashev my master the emperor does not desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty 
 face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to monsieur de but royaute oblige and he felt it incumbent on him as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with envoy he dismounted took arm and moving a few steps away from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended 
 royalty has its obligations 
 balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand because but murat interrupted him 
 then you consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked unexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smile 
 balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war 
 oh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart i wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters 
 and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said 
 i detain you longer general i wish success to your mission and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him 
 balashev rode on supposing from words that he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter iii 
 
 requiescant 
 madame de salon was all that marius pontmercy knew of the world it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life 
 this opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night than day came to him through this skylight 
 this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave 
 surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages he gazed about him with serious amazement 
 everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him 
 there were in madame de salon some very noble ladies named mathan noe was pronounced pronounced cambyse 
 these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart and when they were all there seated in a circle around a dying fire sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green with their severe profiles their gray or white hair their long gowns of another age whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished dropping at rare intervals words which were both majestic and severe little marius stared at them with frightened eyes in the conviction that he beheld not women but patriarchs and magi not real beings but phantoms 
 with these phantoms priests were sometimes mingled frequenters of this ancient salon and some gentlemen the marquis de sass private secretary to madame de berry the vicomte de val who published under the pseudonyme of monorhymed odes the prince de beauff who though very young had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife whose very toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows the marquis de the man in all france who best understood proportioned politeness the comte the kindly man with the amiable chin and the chevalier de a pillar of the library of the louvre called the cabinet m de bald and rather aged than old was wont to relate that in at the age of sixteen he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian the bishop of mirepoix also refractory but as a priest while he was so in the capacity of a soldier 
 this was at toulon their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses and their red blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck which was dry in the morning and wet at night these tragic tales abounded in madame de salon and by dint of cursing marat they applauded trestaillon 
 some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there m thibord du chalard m lemarchant de gomicourt and the celebrated scoffer of the right m the bailiff de ferrette with his short breeches and his thin legs sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de talleyrand 
 he had been m le comte companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe he had made the guimard crawl on all fours and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff as for the priests there was the abbe halma the same to whom m larose his collaborator on la foudre said 
 bah 
 who is there who is not fifty years old a few greenhorns perhaps the abbe letourneur preacher to the king the abbe frayssinous who was not as yet either count or bishop or minister or peer and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing and the abbe keravenant cure of also the nuncio then monsignor macchi archbishop of nisibi later on cardinal remarkable for his long pensive nose and another monsignor entitled thus 
 abbate palmieri domestic prelate one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the holy see canon of the illustrious liberian basilica advocate of the saints postulatore dei santi which refers to matters of canonization and signifies very nearly master of requests of the section of paradise 
 lastly two cardinals m de la luzerne and m de cl t the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have a few years later the honor of signing in the conservateur articles side by side with chateaubriand m de cl t was archbishop of toul and often made trips to paris to his nephew the marquis de t who was minister of marine and war 
 the cardinal of cl t was a merry little man who displayed his red stockings beneath his cassock his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who at that epoch passed through the rue m on summer evenings where the hotel de cl t then stood halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his conclavist monseigneur cotiret bishop in partibus of caryste mark abbe i make a cannon 
 the cardinal de cl t had been brought to madame de by his most intimate friend m de roquelaure former bishop of senlis and one of the forty m de roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french academy then held its meetings the curious could on every tuesday contemplate the of senlis usually standing erect freshly powdered in violet hose with his back turned to the door apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar 
 all these ecclesiastics though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen added to the gravity of the t salon whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vib the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte damb and the duc de val this duc de val although prince de mon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of france and its peerage that he viewed everything through their medium it was he who said 
 the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france of england 
 moreover as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois m gillenormand reigned there 
 there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society there reputations even royalist reputations were held in quarantine there is always a trace of anarchy in renown 
 chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene 
 some of the did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance comte beug was received there subject to correction 
 the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons the faubourg reeks of the fagot even now 
 the royalists of are demagogues let us record it to their credit 
 at madame de the society was superior taste was exquisite and haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive 
 some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique 
 a woman was called madame la generale 
 madame la colonelle was not entirely disused the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse preferred this appellation to her title of princesse 
 the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle 
 it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper 
 men and deeds were brought to judgment there 
 they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it they abetted each other in amazement 
 they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed methuselah bestowed information on epimenides 
 the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things 
 they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed in the same manner that louis xviii 
 was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence 
 all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus 
 there were some young people but they were rather dead 
 the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp 
 they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre 
 nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserver conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the point 
 there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it it was a mummified society 
 the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw 
 a worthy old marquise an emigree and ruined who had but a solitary maid continued to say 
 my people 
 what did they do in madame de salon 
 they were ultra 
 to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day let us explain it 
 to be ultra is to go beyond 
 it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against 
 the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration 
 nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of m de villele the practical man of the right 
 these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past 
 there existed in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre 
 former days did not recognize yesterday 
 people no longer had the feeling for what was grand 
 there was some one who called bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists 
 nothing of it we repeat exists when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge 
 it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge 
 it has disappeared beneath two revolutions 
 what billows are ideas 
 how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful gulfs 
 such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m martainville had more wit than voltaire 
 these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed in fievee 
 m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais 
 napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into history of m le marquis de bonaparte of the armies was a concession to the spirit of the age 
 these salons did not long preserve their purity 
 beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats 
 the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth 
 they assumed the poses of wise men 
 they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle 
 they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes 
 they were heard to say thanks for royalism 
 it has rendered more than one service 
 it has brought back tradition worship religion respect 
 it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted 
 it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation 
 its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age 
 but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them 
 the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism 
 what an error and what blindness 
 revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself 
 after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july 
 they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the it seems that we must always have something to proscribe 
 does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the from the bridge of jena what was it that he did 
 what are we doing 
 bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo 
 the are ours as well as the that is our patrimony 
 to what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history 
 why not love the whole of france 
 it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection 
 the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation characterized the second skill follows ardor 
 let us confine ourselves here to this sketch 
 in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea 
 souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past 
 moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate it it was the france of former days 
 marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do 
 when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant 
 marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school 
 he was a royalist fanatical and severe 
 he did not love his grandfather much as the gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy 
 he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness 
 requiescant

 there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society there reputations even royalist reputations were held in quarantine there is always a trace of anarchy in renown 
 chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene 
 some of the did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance comte beug was received there subject to correction 
 the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons the faubourg reeks of the fagot even now 
 the royalists of are demagogues let us record it to their credit 
 at madame de the society was superior taste was exquisite and haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive 
 some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique 
 a woman was called madame la generale 
 madame la colonelle was not entirely disused the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse preferred this appellation to her title of princesse 
 the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle 
 it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper 
 men and deeds were brought to judgment there 
 they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it they abetted each other in amazement 
 they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed methuselah bestowed information on epimenides 
 the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things 
 they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed in the same manner that louis xviii 
 was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence 
 all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus 
 there were some young people but they were rather dead 
 the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp 
 they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre 
 nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserver conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the point 
 there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it it was a mummified society 
 the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw 
 a worthy old marquise an emigree and ruined who had but a solitary maid continued to say 
 my people 
 what did they do in madame de salon 
 they were ultra 
 to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day let us explain it 
 to be ultra is to go beyond 
 it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against 
 the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration 
 nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of m de villele the practical man of the right 
 these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past 
 there existed in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre 
 former days did not recognize yesterday 
 people no longer had the feeling for what was grand 
 there was some one who called bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists 
 nothing of it we repeat exists when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge 
 it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge 
 it has disappeared beneath two revolutions 
 what billows are ideas 
 how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful gulfs 
 such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m martainville had more wit than voltaire 
 these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed in fievee 
 m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais 
 napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into history of m le marquis de bonaparte of the armies was a concession to the spirit of the age 
 these salons did not long preserve their purity 
 beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats 
 the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth 
 they assumed the poses of wise men 
 they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle 
 they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes 
 they were heard to say thanks for royalism 
 it has rendered more than one service 
 it has brought back tradition worship religion respect 
 it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted 
 it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation 
 its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age 
 but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them 
 the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism 
 what an error and what blindness 
 revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself 
 after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july 
 they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the it seems that we must always have something to proscribe 
 does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the from the bridge of jena what was it that he did 
 what are we doing 
 bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo 
 the are ours as well as the that is our patrimony 
 to what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history 
 why not love the whole of france 
 it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection 
 the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation characterized the second skill follows ardor 
 let us confine ourselves here to this sketch 
 in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea 
 souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past 
 moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate it it was the france of former days 
 marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do 
 when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant 
 marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school 
 he was a royalist fanatical and severe 
 he did not love his grandfather much as the gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy 
 he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness

 chapter v 
 
 davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexander though not a coward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty 
 in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a mustache with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle 
 balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a hut writing he was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and sneered malevolently 
 when he noticed in face the disagreeable impression this reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted 
 thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after hearing him became still surlier and ruder 
 where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to the emperor 
 balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor 
 your orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout you must do as told 
 and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty 
 balashev took out the packet containing the letter and laid it on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription 
 you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to his majesty 
 davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on face 
 you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in his pocket left the shed 
 a minute later the adjutant de castres came in and conducted balashev to the quarters assigned him 
 that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels 
 next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur de castres 
 after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved and after several marches with the baggage and the french army which occupied the whole district balashev was brought to vilna now occupied by the french through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously 
 next day the imperial the comte de turenne came to balashev and informed him of the emperor wish to honor him with an audience 
 four days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission

 chapter iv 
 
 end of the brigand 
 the conclusion of marius classical studies coincided with m departure from society 
 the old man bade farewell to the faubourg and to madame de salon and established himself in the mardis in his house of the rue des there he had for servants in addition to the porter that chambermaid nicolette who had succeeded to magnon and that and pursy basque who have been mentioned above 
 in marius had just attained his seventeenth year 
 one evening on his return home he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand 
 marius said m gillenormand you will set out for vernon 
 why said marius 
 to see your father 
 marius was seized with a trembling fit 
 he had thought of everything except he should one day be called upon to see his father nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit it more disagreeable to him 
 it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation 
 it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty 
 marius in addition to his motives of political antipathy was convinced that his father the slasher as m gillenormand called him on his amiable days did not love him this was evident since he had abandoned him to others 
 feeling that he was not beloved he did not love 
 nothing is more simple he said to himself 
 he was so astounded that he did not question m gillenormand the grandfather resumed 
 it appears that he is ill 
 he demands your presence 
 and after a pause he added 
 set out morning 
 i think there is a coach which leaves the cour des fontaines at six and which arrives in the evening take it 
 he says that here is haste 
 then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning 
 a diligence from the rue du bouloi took the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon 
 neither marius nor thought of making inquiries about it 
 the next day at twilight marius reached vernon 
 people were just beginning to light their candles 
 he asked the first person whom be met for m house 
 for in his own mind he agreed with the restoration and like it did not recognize his claim to the title of either colonel or baron 
 the house was pointed out to him 
 he rang a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door 
 m pontmercy said marius 
 the woman remained motionless 
 is this his house demanded marius 
 the woman nodded affirmatively 
 can i speak with him 
 the woman shook her head 
 but i am his son persisted marius 
 he is expecting me 
 he no longer expects you said the woman 
 then he perceived that she was weeping 
 she pointed to the door of a room on the he entered 
 in that room which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the there were three men one standing erect another kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt 
 the one on the floor was the colonel 
 the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in prayer 
 the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he had written to m gillenormand to demand his son 
 the malady had grown worse 
 on the very evening of marius arrival at vernon the colonel had had an attack of delirium he had risen from his bed in spite of the efforts to prevent him crying 
 my son is not coming 
 i shall go to meet him 
 then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber 
 he had just expired 
 the doctor had been summoned and the cure 
 the doctor had arrived too late 
 the son had also arrived too late 
 by the dim light of the candle a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate cheek where it had trickled from his dead eye 
 the eye was extinguished but the tear was not yet dry 
 that tear was his delay 
 marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that venerable and manly face on those open eyes which saw not on those white locks those robust limbs on which here and there brown lines marking and a sort of red stars which indicated were visible 
 he contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness 
 he reflected that this man was his father and that this man was dead and a chill ran over him 
 the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in death 
 anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber 
 the was lamenting in a corner the cure was praying and his sobs were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping 
 the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word he was the stranger there 
 marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude he held his hat in his hand and he dropped it on the floor in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it 
 at the same time he experienced remorse and he despised himself for behaving in this manner 
 but was it his fault 
 he did not love his father 
 why should he 
 the colonel had left nothing 
 the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial 
 the servant found a scrap of paper which she handed to marius it contained the following in the handwriting 
 for my emperor made me a baron on the of waterloo 
 since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course 
 below the colonel had added 
 at that same battle of waterloo a sergeant saved my life the name was thenardier 
 i think that he has recently been keeping a little inn in a village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles or montfermeil 
 if my son meets him he will do all the good he can to thenardier 
 marius took this paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man 
 nothing remained of the colonel 
 m gillenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an dealer 
 the neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers 
 the other plants turned to nettles and weeds and died 
 marius remained only hours at vernon 
 after the interment he returned to paris and applied himself again to his law studies with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived in two days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten 
 marius wore crape on his hat 
 that was all

 chapter vi 
 
 though balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of court 
 the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals and polish magnates several of whom balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going for his ride 
 after some minutes the who was on duty came into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow him 
 balashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into a study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps firm and resolute they were those of napoleon he had just finished dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his full face rather with its prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome 
 he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that day 
 he nodded in answer to low and respectful bow and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well 
 good day general said he i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with his large eyes into face and immediately looked past him 
 it was plain that personality did not interest him at all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will 
 i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me 
 and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations 
 when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the russian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long before sire the emperor my master but the sight of the eyes bent on him confused him you are flurried compose yourself napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at uniform and sword 
 balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did not consider demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiative and without his assent that the emperor alexander did not desire war and had no relations with england 
 not yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to his feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed 
 after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but some complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he wished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that the french army retires beyond the niemen 
 napoleon noticed embarrassment when uttering these last words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech that followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily noticed the quivering of left leg which increased the more napoleon raised his voice 
 i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand 
 the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashev 
 the niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyond the niemen only the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at balashev 
 the latter bowed his head respectfully 
 instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room 
 you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder and yet you are willing to negotiate 
 he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me he remarked at a later date 
 such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to his own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the aim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continued hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and power and errors and duplicity 
 the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talking and the more he talked the less could he control his words 
 the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult alexander just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview 
 i hear you have made peace with turkey 
 balashev bowed his head affirmatively 
 peace has been concluded he began 
 but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone 
 yes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those provinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and would have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now he have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to his nose and greedily sniffed at it 
 what a splendid reign the emperor might have been 
 he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him 
 what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor mind granted that were they competent they might be made use of continued napoleon hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his perception the two were one and the same but they are not even that they are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his first movements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to act does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result bagration alone is a military man stupid but he has experience a quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to be a military commander 
 the campaign began only a week ago and you even been able to defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces your army is grumbling 
 on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty the troops are burning with eagerness 
 i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you have not two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i give you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight i give you my word of honor that i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you as for the swedes it is their fate to be governed by mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for another bernadotte who promptly went mad for no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad 
 napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose 
 balashev knew how to reply to each of remarks and would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking at the movements of stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes 
 but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have allies the poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them 
 and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round drew close to face and gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands almost shouted 
 know that if you stir up prussia against me wipe it off the map of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching 
 he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev he paused looked ironically straight into eyes and said in a quiet voice 
 and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had 
 balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know your duty to say that but you believe it yourself i have convinced you 
 when balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door opened a bending respectfully handed the emperor his hat and gloves another brought hima pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance turned to balashev 
 assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter to the emperor 
 and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase

 the utility of going to mass in order to become a revolutionist 
 marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood one sunday when he went to hear mass at at that same chapel of the virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad he placed himself behind a pillar being more and thoughtful than usual on that occasion and knelt down without paying any special heed upon a chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name 
 monsieur mabeuf warden 
 mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to marius 
 this is my place sir 
 marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his chair 
 the mass concluded marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant the old man approached him again and said 
 i beg your pardon sir for having disturbed you a while ago and for again disturbing you at this moment you must have thought me intrusive and i will explain myself 
 there is no need of that sir said marius 
 yes went on the old man i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me 
 you see i am attached to this place 
 it seems to me that the mass is better from here 
 why 
 i will tell you it is from this place that i have watched a poor brave father come regularly every two or three months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family arrangements he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass 
 the little one never suspected that his father was there perhaps he did not even know that he had a father poor innocent the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen he gazed at his child and he wept 
 he adored that little fellow poor man 
 i could see that 
 this spot has become sanctified in my sight and i have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass 
 i prefer it to the stall to which i have a right in my capacity of warden 
 i knew that unhappy gentleman a little too he had a a wealthy aunt relatives i know exactly what all who threatened to disinherit the child if he the father saw him 
 he sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day 
 he was separated from him because of political opinions 
 certainly i approve of political opinions but there are people who do not know where to stop mon dieu a man is not a monster because he was at waterloo a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that he was one of colonels 
 he is dead i believe 
 he lived at vernon where i have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pontmarie or montpercy 
 he had a fine on my honor 
 pontmercy suggested marius turning pale 
 precisely pontmercy 
 did you know him 
 sir said marius he was my father 
 the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed 
 ah you are the child 
 yes true he must be a man by this time 
 well poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly 
 marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings 
 on the following day he said to m gillenormand 
 i have arranged a with some friends 
 will you permit me to be absent for three days 
 four replied his grandfather 
 go and amuse yourself 
 and he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love affair

 after all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with him an insulted envoy especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but to his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dine with the emperor that day 
 bessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner 
 napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign of constraint or on account of his outburst that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he did it 
 the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him 
 at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by his curiosity 
 how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in moscow he asked 
 and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches he remarked 
 why such a quantity of churches 
 the russians are very devout replied balashev 
 but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark 
 balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor 
 every country has its own character said he 
 but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon 
 i beg your pardon returned balashev besides russia there is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries 
 this reply of which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at court but it was not much appreciated at dinner where it passed unnoticed 
 the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what tone suggested if there is a point we see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the direct road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the road through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences 
 after dinner they went to drink coffee in study which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a chair beside him 
 napoleon was in that mood which more than any reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile 
 they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his superiority to alexander 
 balashev made no reply and bowed and bowed his head in silence 
 yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and smile what i understand he went on is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may the same and he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his anger which was still fresh in him 
 and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with his hand drive all his wurttemberg baden and weimar relations out of germany yes drive them out let him prepare an asylum for them in russia 
 balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former humiliation 
 and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a responsibility 
 again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to balashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashev he raised his hand to the russian face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips only 
 to have ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court 
 well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head in reply to bow let him have mine he has a long way to go 
 the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch and the war began

 chapter vi 
 
 the consequences of having met a warden 
 where it was that marius went will be disclosed a little further on 
 marius was absent for three days then he returned to paris went straight to the library of the and asked for the files of the moniteur 
 he read the moniteur he read all the histories of the republic and the empire the memorial de all the memoirs all the newspapers the bulletins the proclamations he devoured everything 
 the first time that he came across his name in the bulletins of the grand army he had a fever for a week he went to see the generals under whom georges pontmercy had served among others comte h mabeuf whom he went to see again told him about the life at vernon the retreat his flowers his solitude 
 marius came to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species of who had been his father 
 in the meanwhile occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thoughts he hardly saw the gillenormands at all 
 he made his appearance at meals then they searched for him and he was not to be found 
 father gillenormand smiled 
 bah bah he is just of the age for the girls 
 sometimes the old man added the deuce 
 i thought it was only an affair of gallantry it seems that it is an affair of passion 
 it was a passion in fact 
 marius was on the high road to adoring his father 
 at the same time his ideas underwent an extraordinary change the phases of this change were numerous and successive 
 as this is the history of many minds of our day we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all 
 that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him 
 the first effect was to dazzle him 
 up to that time the republic the empire had been to him only monstrous words 
 the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire a sword in the night 
 he had just taken a look at it and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows he had beheld with a sort of unprecedented surprise mingled with fear and joy stars sparkling mirabeau vergniaud robespierre camille desmoulins danton and a sun arise napoleon 
 he did not know where he stood 
 he recoiled blinded by the brilliant lights little by little when his astonishment had passed off he grew accustomed to this radiance he contemplated these deeds without dizziness he examined these personages without terror the revolution and the empire presented themselves luminously in perspective before his eye he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts the republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses the empire in the sovereignty of the french idea imposed on europe he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the revolution and the grand figure of france spring forth from the empire he asserted in his conscience that all this had been good what his dazzled state neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation we do not think it necessary to point out here it is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording progress is not accomplished in one stage 
 that stated once for all in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow we continue 
 he then perceived that up to that moment he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father 
 he had not known either the one or the other and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes 
 now he saw and on the one hand he admired while on the other he adored 
 he was filled with regret and remorse and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb oh if his father had still been in existence if he had still had him if god in his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated himself how he would have cried to his father 
 father 
 here i am 
 it is i 
 i have the same heart as thou 
 i am thy son 
 how he would have embraced that white head bathed his hair in tears gazed upon his scar pressed his hands adored his garment kissed his feet 
 oh 
 why had his father died so early before his time before the justice the love of his son had come to him 
 marius had a continual sob in his heart which said to him every moment 
 alas 
 at the same time he became more truly serious more truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith 
 at each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason 
 an inward growth seemed to be in progress within him 
 he was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to father and his country 
 as everything opens when one has a key so he explained to himself that which he had hated he penetrated that which he had abhorred henceforth he plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse 
 when he reflected on his former opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seemed to him already so very ancient he grew indignant yet he smiled 
 from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of napoleon 
 but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor 
 from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of on bonaparte 
 now all the prejudices of the restoration all its interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon it execrated him even more than it did robespierre 
 it had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of mothers 
 bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people which as we lately pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo 
 thus in speaking of bonaparte one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom 
 marius had never entertained about that man as he was other ideas in his mind they had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature there was in him a headstrong little man who hated napoleon 
 on reading history on studying him especially in the documents and materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes of marius was gradually rent 
 he caught a glimpse of something immense and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment on the score of bonaparte as about all the rest each day he saw more distinctly and he set about mounting slowly step by step almost regretfully in the beginning then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps then the vaguely illuminated steps at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm 
 one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof his candle was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window 
 all sorts of reveries reached him from space and mingled with his thoughts 
 what a spectacle is the night 
 one hears dull sounds without knowing whence they proceed one beholds jupiter which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand the azure is black the stars shine it is formidable 
 he was perusing the bulletins of the grand army those heroic strophes penned on the field of battle there at intervals he beheld his name always the name of the emperor the whole of that great empire presented itself to him he felt a flood swelling and rising within him it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath and whispered in his ear he gradually got into a singular state he thought that he heard drums cannon trumpets the measured tread of battalions the dull and distant gallop of the cavalry from time to time his eyes were raised heavenward and gazed upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space then they fell upon his book once more and there they beheld other colossal things moving confusedly 
 his heart contracted within him he was in a transport trembling panting 
 all at once without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window gazed intently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the eternal immensity and exclaimed 
 long live the emperor 
 from that moment forth all was over the ogre of corsica the monster who was the lover of his own actor who took lessons of poisoner of this vanished and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar the emperor had been for his father only the captain whom one admires for whom one sacrifices self he was something more to marius 
 he was the predestined constructor of the french group succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe he was a prodigious architect of a destruction the continuer of charlemagne of louis xi of henry iv of richelieu of louis xiv and of the committee of public safety having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots powerful in his crime 
 he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the great nation 
 he was better than that he was the very incarnation of france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world by the light which he shed 
 marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier and which will guard the future 
 despot but dictator a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution napoleon became for him the as jesus christ is the 
 it will be perceived that like all new converts to a religion his conversion intoxicated him he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far 
 his nature was so constructed once on the downward slope it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag 
 fanaticism for the sword took possession of him and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea he did not perceive that along with genius and he was admitting force that is to say that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry on the one hand that which is divine on the other that which is brutal 
 in many respects he had set about deceiving himself otherwise 
 he admitted everything there is a way of encountering error while on way to the truth he had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump in the new path which he had entered on in judging the mistakes of the old regime as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating circumstances 
 at all events a tremendous step had been taken 
 where he had formerly beheld the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france his orientation had changed 
 what had been his east became the west he had turned squarely round 
 all these revolutions were accomplished within him without his family obtaining an inkling of the case 
 when during this mysterious labor he had entirely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the jacobite and the royalist when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist profoundly democratic and republican he went to an engraver on the quai des orfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name le baron marius pontmercy 
 this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him a change in which everything gravitated round his father 
 only as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any porter he put them in his pocket 
 by another natural consequence in proportion as he drew nearer to his father to the memory and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before he receded from his grandfather 
 we have long ago said that m temper did not please him 
 there already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man the gayety of geronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of werther 
 so long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both marius had met m gillenormand there as on a bridge 
 when the bridge fell an abyss was formed and then over and above all marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt when he reflected that it was m gillenormand who had from stupid motives torn him ruthlessly from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child of the father 
 by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather 
 nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have already said 
 only he grew colder and colder laconic at meals and rare in the house 
 when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and alleged his studies his lectures the examinations etc as a pretext 
 his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis 
 in love 
 i know all about it 
 from time to time marius absented himself 
 where is it that he goes off like this said his aunt 
 on one of these trips which were always very brief he went to montfermeil in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the thenardier 
 thenardier had failed the inn was closed and no one knew what had become of him marius was away from the house for four days on this quest 
 he is getting decidedly wild said his grandfather 
 they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast under his shirt which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon

 after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the city pierre had warned his that prince andrew was on his track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who was always well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey 
 prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again failed to meet kuragin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken faith with him which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious 
 of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on staff he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found kuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met kuragin despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity 
 in the year when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharest where kutuzov had been living for two months passing his days and nights with a wallachian woman prince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer him to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly 
 before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at drissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last three years there had been so many changes in his life he had thought felt and seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west that on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail he entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted sleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness the same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniture the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only somewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden getting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was the same coquettish girl enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same as ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the old prince madmoiselle bourienne and the architect to the other princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and maids 
 during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell him of the young count campaign the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said was the only person really attached to him 
 the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess mary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this say nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or an old fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he understand so i must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince and he began explaining why he could not put up with his unreasonable character 
 if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was censuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish to speak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion if there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i blame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you since you ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritable as he was always liable to do of late i can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not fit to be my companion 
 the old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed 
 what companion my dear boy eh already been talking it over eh 
 father i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and bitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall say that mary is not to blame but those to blame the one to blame is that frenchwoman 
 ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment but then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not a trace of you remain here 
 prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did not leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and tikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next day before leaving prince andrew went to his rooms the boy like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this pretty child his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him and was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee 
 well go on said his son 
 prince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went out of the room 
 as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible 
 so decided to go andrew asked his sister 
 thank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you 
 why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle bourienne says he has been asking about you 
 as soon as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her tears began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room 
 ah my god my god when one thinks who and what what trash can cause people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary 
 she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to mademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness 
 andrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears i understand you she looked down imagine that sorrow is the work of men men are his tools she looked a little above prince head with the confident accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is sent by him not by men men are his instruments they are not to blame if you think someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right to punish and then you will know the happiness of forgiving 
 if i were a woman i would do so mary that is a virtue but a man should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and though till that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart 
 if mary is already persuading me forgive it means that i ought long ago to have punished him he thought and giving her no further reply he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet kuragin who he knew was now in the army 
 princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to him but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become 
 andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men are never to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave of her 
 then it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the avenue from the house at bald hills she poor innocent creature is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits the old man feels he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing up and rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived and i am off to the army why i myself know i want to meet that man whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me 
 these conditions of life had been the same before but then they were all connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another to prince mind

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter vii 
 
 we have mentioned a lancer 
 he was a of m gillenormand on the paternal side who led a garrison life outside the family and far from the domestic hearth 
 lieutenant theodule gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer he had a waist a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook 
 he visited paris very rarely and so rarely that marius had never seen him the cousins knew each other only by name 
 we think we have said that theodule was the favorite of aunt gillenormand who preferred him because she did not see him 
 not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections 
 one morning mademoiselle gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing marius had just asked his permission to take a little trip adding that he meant to set out that very evening go had been his reply and m gillenormand had added in an aside as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead 
 here he is passing the night out again mademoiselle gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation 
 this is too this interrogation 
 but where is it that he goes she espied some adventure of the heart more or less illicit a woman in the shadow a rendezvous a mystery and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal sainted souls do not detest this 
 there is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry 
 so she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history 
 in order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont she took refuge in her talents and set about scalloping with one layer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the empire and the restoration in which there are numerous the work was clumsy the worker cross 
 she had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened 
 mademoiselle gillenormand raised her nose lieutenant theodule stood before her making the regulation salute she uttered a cry of delight 
 one may be old one may be a prude one may be pious one may be an aunt but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter chamber 
 you here theodule she exclaimed 
 on my way through town aunt 
 embrace me 
 here goes said theodule 
 and he kissed her 
 aunt gillenormand went to her and opened it 
 you will remain with us a week at least 
 i leave this very evening aunt 
 it is not possible 
 mathematically 
 remain my little theodule i beseech you 
 my heart says yes but my orders say no the matter is simple they are changing our garrison we have been at melun we are being transferred to gaillon 
 it is necessary to pass through paris in order to get from the old post to the new one 
 i said 
 i am going to see my aunt 
 here is something for your trouble 
 and she put ten louis into his hand 
 for my pleasure you mean to say my dear aunt 
 theodule kissed her again and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform 
 are you making the journey on horseback with your regiment she asked him 
 no aunt 
 i wanted to see you 
 i have special permission my servant is taking my horse i am travelling by diligence and by the way i want to ask you something 
 what is it 
 is my cousin marius pontmercy travelling so too 
 how do you know that said his aunt suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity 
 on my arrival i went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe 
 well 
 a traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial i saw his name on the card 
 what name 
 marius pontmercy 
 the wicked fellow exclaimed his aunt 
 ah your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself 
 to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence 
 just as i am going to do 
 but is your duty in his case it is wildness 
 bosh said theodule 
 here an event occurred to mademoiselle gillenormand the elder an idea struck her 
 if she had been a man she would have slapped her brow 
 she apostrophized theodule 
 are you aware whether your cousin knows you 
 no i have seen him but he has never deigned to notice me 
 so you are going to travel together 
 he in the imperial i in the coupe 
 where does this diligence run 
 to andelys 
 then that is where marius is going 
 unless like myself he should stop on the way 
 i get down at vernon in order to take the branch coach for gaillon 
 i know nothing of marius plan of travel 
 marius what an ugly name what possessed them to name him marius while you at least are called theodule 
 i would rather be called alfred said the officer 
 listen theodule 
 i am listening aunt 
 pay attention 
 i am paying attention 
 you understand 
 yes 
 well marius absents himself 
 eh eh 
 he travels 
 ah ah 
 he spends the night out 
 oh oh 
 we should like to know what there is behind all this 
 theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze 
 some petticoat or other 
 and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added 
 a lass 
 that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m gillenormand speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew 
 she resumed 
 do us a favor 
 follow marius a little 
 he does not know you it will be easy 
 since a lass there is try to get a sight of her you must write us the tale 
 it will amuse his grandfather 
 theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel 
 he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt 
 and he added in an aside to himself 
 here i am a duenna 
 mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him 
 you are not the man to play such pranks theodule 
 you obey discipline you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature 
 the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity 
 marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched 
 as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep 
 his slumber was complete and conscientious 
 argus snored all night long 
 at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted 
 vernon relay of vernon 
 travellers for vernon 
 and lieutenant theodule woke 
 good he growled still half asleep this is where i get out 
 then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius this set him to laughing 
 perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform 
 he may have stopped at poissy he may have stopped at triel if he did not get out at meulan he may have got out at mantes unless he got out at rolleboise or if he did not go on as far as pacy with the choice of turning to the left at evreus or to the right at run after him aunty 
 what the devil am i to write to that good old soul 
 at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial made its appearance at the window of the coupe 
 can that be marius said the lieutenant 
 it was marius 
 a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers give your ladies flowers she cried 
 marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket 
 come now said theodule leaping down from the coupe this piques my curiosity 
 who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to she must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet i want to see her 
 and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius 
 marius paid no attention to theodule 
 elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at them 
 he seemed to see nothing around him 
 he is pretty deeply in love thought theodule 
 marius directed his steps towards the church 
 capital said theodule to himself 
 rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort 
 nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good head 
 on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the apse 
 he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse 
 the rendezvous is appointed outside said theodule 
 have a look at the lass 
 and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned 
 on arriving there he halted in amazement 
 marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on a grave 
 he had strewn his bouquet there 
 at the extremity of the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron pontmercy 
 marius sobs were audible 
 the lass was a grave

 chapter ix 
 
 prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortified camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the russian army but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the russian provinces and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western the polish provinces 
 prince andrew found barclay de tolly to whom he had been assigned on the bank of the drissa as there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles barclay de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employment but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had hoped to find with the army was not there he had gone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this his mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of kuragin during the first four days while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts tried to form a definite opinion about it but the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided already from his military experience and what he had seen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy that cannot be foreseen are met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled to clear up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his position and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs 
 while the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been divided into three armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly the army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov the emperor was with the first army but not as commander in chief in the orders issued it was stated not that the emperor would take command but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had with him not a commander in staff but the imperial headquarters staff in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff quartermaster general prince volkonski as well as generals imperial diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners but not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the emperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the of war count bennigsen the senior general in rank the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich count rumyantsev the chancellor stein a former prussian minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuel the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant general and sardinian emigre wolzogen and many others though these men had no military appointment in the army their position gave them influence and often a corps commander or even the commander in chief did not know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand duke arakcheev or prince volkonski or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be executed or not but this was only the external condition the essential significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people from a point of view and in an vicinity all became courtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief but disposed of all the armies the men around him were his assistants arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the bodyguard bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke was there because it suited him to be the stein was there because his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in high esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general full of a quality that always influenced alexander paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole business of the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed thoughts in a more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookish theorist to the point of despising everyone else was able to do 
 besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day especially the foreigners who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there 
 among the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant and proud sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of and parties 
 the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherents military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws laws of oblique movements outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a of war and they saw only barbarism ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and others chiefly germans 
 the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold action this section also represented nationalism which made them still more in the dispute they were russians bagration ermolov who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a famous joke of was being circulated that as a great favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that party remembering suvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason or stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of russia and not let the army get discouraged 
 to the third party in which the emperor had most confidence belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev belonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called him bonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided and therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to what opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say and then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa according to plan but on changing the movements of the other armies though by this course neither one aim nor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party 
 of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon recognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said so they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all this we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible before we are turned out of petersburg 
 this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyantsev who for other reasons of state was in favor of peace 
 the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de tolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief be he what he may they always began like that he is an honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 
 the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually let the others make mistakes now said they arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this what is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen who made his mark in and to whom napoleon himself did justice a man whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is the only such man 
 the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were particularly many round alexander generals and imperial passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had done in and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army gather round him a commander in staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch 
 the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the others as to one consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor bennigsen but only the one most essential thing as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day after merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the eye a fifth to achieve his aim of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct 
 all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the uncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of race among these people this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of these drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly 
 from among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached the army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weakness 
 the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety and that the worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch 
 just at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissa shishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of this party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev agreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully suggested on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital that the emperor should leave the army 
 that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to defend their country the very incitement which was the chief cause of triumph in so far as it was produced by the personal presence in moscow was suggested to the emperor and accepted by him as a pretext for quitting the army

 marble against granite 
 it was hither that marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from paris 
 it was hither that he had come every time that m gillenormand had said 
 he is sleeping out 
 lieutenant theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the colonel 
 he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and there was discipline in this retreat 
 death appeared to him with large epaulets and he almost made the military salute to him not knowing what to write to his aunt he decided not to write at all and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by theodule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate at paris 
 marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the morning descended at his door and wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the he mounted rapidly to his chamber took merely time enough to throw off his and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and went off to the bath 
 who had risen betimes like all old men in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find out where he had been 
 but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend and when father gillenormand entered the attic marius was no longer there 
 the bed had not been disturbed and on the bed lay outspread but not defiantly the and the black ribbon 
 i like this better said m gillenormand 
 and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where mademoiselle gillenormand was already seated busily embroidering her 
 the entrance was a triumphant one 
 m gillenormand held in one hand the and in the other the and exclaimed 
 victory 
 we are about to penetrate the mystery 
 we are going to learn the most minute details we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries of our sly friend 
 here we have the romance itself i have the portrait 
 in fact a case of black shagreen resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon 
 the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him pass under his very nose 
 for this evidently is a portrait 
 i know all about such things that is worn tenderly on the heart 
 how stupid they are some abominable fright that will make us shudder probably 
 young men have such bad taste nowadays 
 let us see father said the old spinster 
 the case opened by the pressure of a spring 
 they found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper 
 from the same to the same said m gillenormand bursting with laughter 
 i know what it is 
 a 
 ah let us read it said the aunt 
 and she put on her spectacles 
 they unfolded the paper and read as follows 
 for my emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo 
 since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course 
 the feelings of father and daughter cannot be described 
 they felt chilled as by the breath of a they did not exchange a word 
 only m gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself 
 it is the handwriting 
 the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case 
 at the same moment a little oblong packet enveloped in blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the mademoiselle gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper 
 it contained marius hundred cards 
 she handed one of them to m gillenormand who read 
 le baron marius pontmercy 
 the old man rang the bell 
 nicolette came 
 m gillenormand took the ribbon the case and the coat flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room and said 
 carry those duds away 
 a full hour passed in the most profound silence 
 the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other and were thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability 
 at the expiration of this hour aunt gillenormand pretty state of things 
 a few moments later marius made his appearance 
 he entered even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing 
 well well well well well so you are a baron now 
 i present you my compliments 
 what is the meaning of this 
 marius reddened slightly and replied 
 it means that i am the son of my father 
 m gillenormand ceased to laugh and said harshly 
 i am your father 
 my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love too fondly two ingrates his country and myself 
 this was more than m gillenormand could bear to hear 
 at the word republic he rose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet 
 every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand 
 from a dull hue he had turned red from red purple and from purple 
 marius he cried 
 abominable child 
 i do not know what your father was 
 i do not wish to know 
 i know nothing about that and i do not know him 
 but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men 
 they were all rascals assassins thieves 
 i say all 
 i say all i know not one 
 i say all 
 do you hear me marius 
 see here you are no more a baron than my slipper is 
 they were all bandits in the service of robespierre 
 all who served were brigands 
 they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their legitimate king 
 all cowards who fled before the prussians and the english at waterloo 
 that is what i do know whether monsieur your father comes in that category i do not know i am sorry for it so much the worse your humble servant 
 in his turn it was marius who was the firebrand and m gillenormand who was the bellows 
 marius quivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire 
 he was the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds the fakir who beholds a spit upon his idol 
 it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence what was he to do 
 his father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom 
 by his grandfather how was he to avenge the one without outraging the other it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged on the one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks 
 he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised his eyes gazed fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder 
 down with the bourbons and that great hog of a louis xviii 
 louis xviii 
 had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him 
 the old man who had been crimson turned whiter than his hair he wheeled round towards a bust of m le duc de berry which stood on the and made a profound bow with a sort of peculiar majesty 
 then he paced twice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking 
 on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calm 
 a baron like this gentleman and a bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof 
 and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath he extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him 
 be off 
 marius left the house 
 on the following day m gillenormand said to his daughter 
 you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that and you will never mention his name to me 
 having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months 
 marius on his side had gone forth in indignation 
 there was one circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation there are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas 
 they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality the wrongs are not increased by them while carrying marius duds precipitately to his chamber at his command nicolette had inadvertently let fall probably on the attic staircase which was dark that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel neither paper nor case could afterwards be found 
 marius was convinced that monsieur that day forth he never alluded to him flung his testament in the fire 
 he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost 
 but the paper the writing that sacred that was his very heart what had been done with it 
 marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and without knowing where with thirty francs his watch and a few clothes in a he had entered a had engaged it by the hour and had directed his course at towards the latin quarter 
 what was to become of marius

 chapter x 
 
 this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one day at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him personally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was to present himself at quarters at six that evening 
 news was received at the quarters that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endanger the army news subsequently found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by pfuel and till then considered a of tactical science which would ensure destruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the russian army 
 prince andrew arrived at quarters a country house of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neither bennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the received bolkonski and informed him that the emperor accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt 
 chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novel in his hand this room had probably been a music room there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of adjutant this adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the bedding evidently exhausted by work or by feasting two doors led from the room one straight on into what had been the drawing room and another on the right to the study through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by the wish not a military council the emperor preferred indefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties it was not a council of war but as it were a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had referred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count stein who was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as prince andrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soon after himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped a minute to speak to chernyshev 
 at first sight pfuel in his uniform of a russian general which fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince andrew though he saw him now for the first time there was about him something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german whom prince andrew had seen in but he was more typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent 
 pfuel was short and very thin but of coarse robust build broad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades his face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly holding up his sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit down to business in front of a map where he would feel at home he nodded hurriedly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had planned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice as germans do it might have been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined or something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him to pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glanced not so much at prince andrew as past him and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard 
 pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to form a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably men to the point of martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are on the basis of an abstract notion science that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women an englishman is as being a citizen of the state in the world and therefore as an englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian is just because he knows nothing does not want to know anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the is worst of all stronger and more repulsive than any other because he imagines that he knows the truth science which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth 
 pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a science the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the wars and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as material for science 
 in pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan of campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on the contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion the sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the object its practical application his love of theory made him hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory 
 he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently 
 he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there

 book friends of the a b c 
 chapter i 
 
 a group which barely missed becoming historic 
 at that epoch which was to all appearances indifferent a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current 
 breaths which had started forth from the depths of and were in the air 
 youth was on the point may the reader pardon us the word of moulting people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age 
 the needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls 
 each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take the royalists were becoming liberals liberals were turning democrats it was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures hence the combination of very singular ideas people adored both napoleon and liberty we are making history here 
 these were the mirages of that period opinions traverse phases 
 voltairian royalism a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist liberalism 
 other groups of minds were more serious 
 in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams 
 and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future 
 utopia flesh and blood 
 these advanced opinions had a double foundation 
 a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and underhand 
 a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree 
 the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine 
 the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups 
 there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations like the german tugendbund and italian carbonarism but here and there there were dark underminings which were in process of throwing off shoots 
 the cougourde was being outlined at aix there existed at paris among other affiliations of that nature the society of the friends of the a b c 
 what were these friends of the a b c 
 a society which had for its object apparently the education of children in reality the elevation of man 
 they declared themselves the friends of the a b abaisse the is to say the people 
 they wished to elevate the people 
 it was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at puns are sometimes serious factors in politics witness the castratus ad castra which made a general of the army of narses witness barbari et barberini witness 
 tu es petrus et super hanc petram etc etc 
 the friends of the a b c were not numerous it was a secret society in the state of embryo we might almost say a coterie if coteries ended in heroes 
 they assembled in paris in two localities near the in a called corinthe of which more will be heard later on and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue called the cafe musain now torn down the first of these was close to the workingman the second to the students 
 the assemblies of the friends of the a b c were usually held in a back room of the cafe musain 
 this hall which was tolerably remote from the cafe with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little rue des gres 
 there they smoked and drank and gambled and laughed 
 there they conversed in very loud tones about everything and in whispers of other things an old map of france under the republic was nailed to the wall a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent 
 the greater part of the friends of the a b c were students who were on cordial terms with the working classes 
 here are the names of the principal ones 
 they belong in a certain measure to history 
 enjolras combeferre jean prouvaire feuilly courfeyrac bahorel lesgle or laigle joly grantaire 
 these young men formed a sort of family through the bond of friendship 
 all with the exception of laigle were from the south 
 this was a remarkable group 
 it vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us 
 at the point of this drama which we have now reached it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure 
 enjolras whose name we have mentioned first of reader shall see why later an only son and wealthy 
 enjolras was a charming young man who was capable of being terrible he was angelically handsome 
 he was a savage antinous 
 one would have said to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance that he had already in some previous state of existence traversed the revolutionary apocalypse 
 he possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness 
 he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair 
 a pontifical and warlike nature a singular thing in a youth 
 he was an officiating priest and a man of war from the immediate point of view a soldier of the democracy above the contemporary movement the priest of the ideal 
 his eyes were deep his lids a little red his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful his brow was lofty 
 a great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view 
 like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last who became illustrious at an early age he was endowed with excessive youth and was as rosy as a young girl although subject to hours of pallor already a man he still seemed a child 
 his two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen he was serious it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman he had but one right but one overthrow the obstacle 
 on mount aventine he would have been gracchus in the convention he would have been he hardly saw the roses he ignored spring he did not hear the carolling of the birds the bare throat of evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved aristogeiton he like harmodius thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword he was severe in his enjoyments 
 he chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the republic 
 he was the marble lover of liberty 
 his speech was harshly inspired and had the thrill of a hymn 
 he was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul woe to the which should have risked itself beside him if any grisette of the place cambrai or the rue seeing that face of a youth escaped from college that mien those long golden lashes those blue eyes that hair billowing in the wind those rosy cheeks those fresh lips those exquisite teeth had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora and had tried her beauty on enjolras an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of ezekiel with the gallant cherubino of beaumarchais 
 by the side of enjolras who represented the logic of the revolution combeferre represented its philosophy 
 between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this its logic may end in war whereas its philosophy can end only in peace combeferre complemented and rectified enjolras 
 he was less lofty but broader 
 he desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas 
 he said 
 revolution but civilization and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky the revolution was more adapted for breathing with combeferre than with enjolras 
 enjolras expressed its divine right and combeferre its natural right 
 the first attached himself to robespierre the second confined himself to condorcet 
 combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did enjolras if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history the one would have been the just the other the wise man enjolras was the more virile combeferre the more humane 
 homo and vir that was the exact effect of their different shades 
 combeferre was as gentle as enjolras was severe through natural whiteness he loved the word citizen but he preferred the word man 
 he would gladly have said 
 hombre like the spanish 
 he read everything went to the theatres attended the courses of public lecturers learned the polarization of light from arago grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which geoffrey explained the double function of the external carotid artery and the internal the one which makes the face and the one which makes the brain he kept up with what was going on followed science step by step compared with fourier deciphered hieroglyphics broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology drew from memory a silkworm moth pointed out the faulty french in the dictionary of the academy studied puysegur and deleuze affirmed nothing not even miracles denied nothing not even ghosts turned over the files of the moniteur reflected 
 he declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster and busied himself with educational questions 
 he desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level at coining science at putting ideas into circulation at increasing the mind in youthful persons and he feared lest the present poverty of method the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds 
 he was learned a purist exact a graduate of the polytechnic a close student and at the same time thoughtful even to chimaeras so his friends said he believed in all dreams railroads the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations the fixing of images in the dark chamber the electric telegraph the steering of balloons 
 moreover he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction by superstition despotism and prejudice he was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position 
 enjolras was a chief combeferre was a guide one would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other 
 it is not that combeferre was not capable of fighting he did not refuse a combat with the obstacle and to attack it by main force and explosively but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually by means of education the inculcation of axioms the promulgation of positive laws and between two lights his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration a conflagration can create an aurora no doubt but why not await the dawn 
 a volcano illuminates but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination 
 possibly combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime 
 a light troubled by smoke progress purchased at the expense of violence only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit 
 the headlong precipitation of a people into the truth a terrified him nevertheless stagnation was still more repulsive to him in it he detected putrefaction and death on the whole he preferred scum to miasma and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool and the falls of niagara to the lake of montfaucon 
 in short he desired neither halt nor haste 
 while his tumultuous friends captivated by the absolute adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures combeferre was inclined to let progress good progress take its own course he may have been cold but he was pure methodical but irreproachable phlegmatic but imperturbable 
 combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races 
 the good must be innocent he repeated incessantly and in fact if the grandeur of the revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings with fire and blood in its talons the beauty of progress lies in being spotless and there exists between washington who represents the one and danton who incarnates the other that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle 
 jean prouvaire was a still softer shade than combeferre 
 his name was jehan owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the middle ages 
 jean prouvaire was in love he cultivated a pot of flowers played on the flute made verses loved the people pitied woman wept over the child confounded god and the future in the same confidence and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head that of andre chenier his voice was ordinarily delicate but suddenly grew manly he was learned even to erudition and almost an orientalist above all he was good and a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur in the matter of poetry he preferred the immense 
 he knew italian latin greek and hebrew and these served him only for the perusal of four poets dante juvenal aeschylus and isaiah 
 in french he preferred corneille to racine and agrippa to corneille he loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events his mind had two attitudes one on the side towards man the other on that towards god he studied or he contemplated 
 all day long he buried himself in social questions salary capital credit marriage religion liberty of thought education penal servitude poverty association property production and sharing the enigma of this lower world which covers the human with darkness and at night he gazed upon the planets those enormous beings like enjolras he was wealthy and an only son 
 he spoke softly bowed his head lowered his eyes smiled with embarrassment dressed badly had an awkward air blushed at a mere nothing and was very timid 
 yet he was intrepid 
 feuilly was a workingman a orphaned both of father and mother who earned with difficulty three francs a day and had but one thought to deliver the world 
 he had one other preoccupation to educate himself he called this also delivering himself he had taught himself to read and write everything that he knew he had learned by himself 
 feuilly had a generous heart 
 the range of his embrace was immense 
 this orphan had adopted the peoples as his mother had failed him he meditated on his country he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people over what we now call the idea of the nationality had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case in this club of young utopians occupied chiefly with france he represented the outside world 
 he had for his specialty greece poland hungary roumania italy 
 he uttered these names incessantly appropriately and inappropriately with the tenacity of right the violations of turkey on greece and thessaly of russia on warsaw of austria on venice enraged him 
 above all things the great violence of aroused him 
 there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation he was eloquent with that eloquence 
 he was inexhaustible on that infamous date of on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason and that crime on that monstrous ambush the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states which since that time have struck many a noble nation and have annulled their certificate of birth so to speak all contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of poland 
 the partition of poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries 
 there has not been a despot nor a traitor for nearly a century back who has not signed approved and copied ne variatur the partition of poland when the record of modern treasons was examined that was the first thing which made its appearance 
 the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own 
 sounded the onset was the death of the game 
 such was habitual text this poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of justice and she recompensed him by rendering him great 
 the fact is that there is eternity in right 
 warsaw can no more be tartar than venice can be teuton 
 kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so 
 sooner or later the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears 
 greece becomes greece again italy is once more italy 
 the protest of right against the deed persists forever 
 the theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription 
 these lofty deeds of rascality have no future a nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief 
 courfeyrac had a father who was called m de courfeyrac 
 one of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle the particle as every one knows possesses no significance but the bourgeois of the epoch of la minerve estimated so highly that poor de that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it m de chauvelin had himself called m chauvelin m de caumartin m caumartin m de constant de robecque benjamin constant m de lafayette m lafayette 
 courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest and called himself plain courfeyrac 
 we might almost so far as courfeyrac is concerned stop here and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains for courfeyrac see tholomyes 
 courfeyrac had in fact that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind 
 later on this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten and all this grace ends with the bourgeois on two legs and with the tomcat on four paws 
 this sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools who pass it from hand to hand quasi cursores and is almost always exactly the same so that as we have just pointed out any one who had listened to courfeyrac in would have thought he heard tholomyes in 
 only courfeyrac was an honorable fellow beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind the difference between him and tholomyes was very great 
 the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second 
 there was in tholomyes a district attorney and in courfeyrac a paladin 
 enjolras was the chief combeferre was the guide courfeyrac was the centre 
 the others gave more light he shed more warmth the truth is that he possessed all the qualities of a centre roundness and radiance 
 bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of june on the occasion of the burial of young lallemand 
 bahorel was a mortal who kept bad company brave a spendthrift prodigal and to the verge of generosity talkative and at times eloquent bold to the verge of effrontery the best fellow possible he had daring waistcoats and scarlet opinions a wholesale blusterer that is to say loving nothing so much as a quarrel unless it were an uprising and nothing so much as an uprising unless it were a revolution always ready to smash a then to tear up the pavement then to demolish a government just to see the effect of it a student in his eleventh year he had nosed about the law but did not practise it 
 he had taken for his device 
 never a lawyer and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap 
 every time that he passed the which rarely happened he buttoned up his paletot had not yet been took hygienic precautions 
 of the school porter he said 
 what a fine old man and of the dean m delvincourt 
 what a monument in his lectures he espied subjects for ballads and in his professors occasions for caricature 
 he wasted a tolerably large allowance something like three thousand francs a year in doing nothing 
 he had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son 
 he said of them 
 they are peasants and not bourgeois that is the reason they are intelligent 
 bahorel a man of caprice was scattered over numerous cafes the others had habits he had none 
 he sauntered 
 to stray is human to saunter is parisian 
 in reality he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view 
 he served as a connecting link between the friends of the a b c and other still unorganized groups which were destined to take form later on 
 in this conclave of young heads there was one bald member 
 the marquis whom louis xviii 
 made a duke for having assisted him to enter a on the day when he emigrated was wont to relate that in on his return to france as the king was disembarking at calais a man handed him a petition 
 what is your request said the king 
 sire a 
 what is your name 
 
 the king frowned glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus 
 lesgle 
 this orthography touched the king and he began to smile 
 sire resumed the man with the petition i had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed lesgueules 
 this surname furnished my name 
 i am called lesgueules by contraction lesgle and by corruption this caused the king to smile broadly 
 later on he gave the man the posting office of meaux either intentionally or accidentally 
 the bald member of the group was the son of this lesgle or legle and he signed himself legle de meaux as an abbreviation his companions called him bossuet 
 bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow 
 his specialty was not to succeed in anything 
 as an offset he laughed at everything at five and twenty he was bald 
 his father had ended by owning a house and a field but he the son had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation 
 he had nothing left he possessed knowledge and wit but all he did miscarried everything failed him and everybody deceived him what he was building tumbled down on top of him 
 if he were splitting wood he cut off a finger 
 if he had a mistress he speedily discovered that he had a friend also 
 some misfortune happened to him every moment hence his joviality 
 he said 
 i live under falling tiles he was not easily astonished because for him an accident was what he had foreseen he took his bad luck serenely and smiled at the teasing of fate like a person who is listening to pleasantries he was poor but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible he soon reached his last sou never his last burst of laughter when adversity entered his doors he saluted this old acquaintance cordially he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname good day guignon he said to it 
 these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive 
 he was full of resources 
 he had no money but he found means when it seemed good to him to indulge in unbridled extravagance 
 one night he went so far as to eat a hundred francs in a supper with a wench which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy 
 pull off my boots you jade 
 bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bahorel 
 bossuet had not much domicile sometimes none at all he lodged now with one now with another most often with joly joly was studying medicine 
 he was two years younger than bossuet 
 joly was the malade imaginaire junior 
 what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor 
 at three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror 
 he affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south and the foot to the north so that at night the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe 
 during thunder storms he felt his pulse 
 otherwise he was the gayest of them all all these young maniacal puny merry incoherences lived in harmony together and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades who were prodigal of winged consonants called jolllly you may fly away on the four jean prouvaire said to him 
 wing 
 joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane which is an indication of a sagacious mind 
 all these young men who differed so greatly and who on the whole can only be discussed seriously held the same religion 
 progress 
 all were the direct sons of the french revolution 
 the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date 
 
 their fathers in the flesh had been either royalists doctrinaires it matters not what this confusion anterior to themselves who were young did not concern them at all the pure blood of principle ran in their veins 
 they attached themselves without intermediate shades to incorruptible right and absolute duty 
 affiliated and initiated they sketched out the ideal underground 
 among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds there was one sceptic 
 how came he there 
 by juxtaposition this name was grantaire and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus 
 r grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything 
 moreover he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the cafe lemblin and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the ermitage on the boulevard du maine spatchcocked chickens at mother excellent matelotes at the barriere de la cunette and a certain thin white wine at the barriere du com pat 
 he knew the best place for everything in addition boxing and and some dances and he was a thorough player 
 he was a tremendous drinker to boot he was inordinately homely 
 the prettiest of that day irma boissy enraged with his homeliness pronounced sentence on him as follows 
 grantaire is impossible but fatuity was not to be disconcerted 
 he stared tenderly and fixedly at all women with the air of saying to them all 
 if i only chose and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand 
 all those words 
 rights of the people rights of man the social contract the french revolution the republic democracy humanity civilization religion progress came very near to signifying nothing whatever to grantaire 
 he smiled at them scepticism that caries of the intelligence had not left him a single whole idea 
 he lived with irony 
 this was his axiom there is but one certainty my full glass 
 he sneered at all devotion in all parties the father as well as the brother robespierre junior as well as loizerolles 
 they are greatly in advance to be dead he exclaimed 
 he said of the crucifix 
 there is a gibbet which has been a success 
 a rover a gambler a libertine often drunk he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly les filles et le bon vin 
 air 
 vive henri iv 
 however this sceptic had one fanaticism 
 this fanaticism was neither a dogma nor an idea nor an art nor a science it was a man 
 enjolras 
 grantaire admired loved and venerated enjolras to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds 
 to the most absolute 
 in what manner had enjolras subjugated him 
 by his ideas 
 no by his character a phenomenon which is often observable 
 a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors 
 that which we lack attracts us 
 no one loves the light like the blind man the dwarf adores the the toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven 
 why 
 in order to watch the bird in its flight grantaire in whom writhed doubt loved to watch faith soar in enjolras he had need of enjolras 
 that chaste healthy firm upright hard candid nature charmed him without his being clearly aware of it and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him 
 he admired his opposite by instinct 
 his soft yielding dislocated sickly shapeless ideas attached themselves to enjolras as to a spinal column 
 his moral backbone leaned on that firmness grantaire in the presence of enjolras became some one once more he was himself moreover composed of two elements which were to all appearance incompatible 
 he was ironical and cordial his indifference loved 
 his mind could get along without belief but his heart could not get along without friendship a profound contradiction for an affection is a conviction his nature was thus constituted 
 there are men who seem to be born to be the reverse the obverse the wrong side 
 they are pollux patrocles nisus eudamidas ephestion pechmeja 
 they only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man their name is a sequel and is only written preceded by the conjunction and and their existence is not their own it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs 
 grantaire was one of these men he was the obverse of enjolras 
 one might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet 
 in the series o and p are inseparable 
 you can at will pronounce o and p or orestes and pylades 
 grantaire enjolras true satellite inhabited this circle of young men he lived there he took no pleasure anywhere but there he followed them everywhere 
 his joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of wine 
 they tolerated him on account of his good humor 
 enjolras the believer disdained this sceptic and a sober man himself scorned this drunkard 
 he accorded him a little lofty pity 
 grantaire was an unaccepted pylades 
 always harshly treated by enjolras roughly repulsed rejected yet ever returning to the charge he said of enjolras 
 what fine marble 
 a group which barely missed becoming historic 
 at that epoch which was to all appearances indifferent a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current 
 breaths which had started forth from the depths of and were in the air 
 youth was on the point may the reader pardon us the word of moulting people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age 
 the needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls 
 each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take the royalists were becoming liberals liberals were turning democrats it was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures hence the combination of very singular ideas people adored both napoleon and liberty we are making history here 
 these were the mirages of that period opinions traverse phases 
 voltairian royalism a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist liberalism 
 other groups of minds were more serious 
 in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams 
 and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future 
 utopia flesh and blood 
 these advanced opinions had a double foundation 
 a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and underhand 
 a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree 
 the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine 
 the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups 
 there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations like the german tugendbund and italian carbonarism but here and there there were dark underminings which were in process of throwing off shoots 
 the cougourde was being outlined at aix there existed at paris among other affiliations of that nature the society of the friends of the a b c 
 what were these friends of the a b c 
 a society which had for its object apparently the education of children in reality the elevation of man 
 they declared themselves the friends of the a b abaisse the is to say the people

 it was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at puns are sometimes serious factors in politics witness the castratus ad castra which made a general of the army of narses witness barbari et barberini witness 
 tu es petrus et super hanc petram etc etc 
 the friends of the a b c were not numerous it was a secret society in the state of embryo we might almost say a coterie if coteries ended in heroes 
 they assembled in paris in two localities near the in a called corinthe of which more will be heard later on and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue called the cafe musain now torn down the first of these was close to the workingman the second to the students

 there they conversed in very loud tones about everything and in whispers of other things an old map of france under the republic was nailed to the wall a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent 
 the greater part of the friends of the a b c were students who were on cordial terms with the working classes 
 here are the names of the principal ones 
 they belong in a certain measure to history 
 enjolras combeferre jean prouvaire feuilly courfeyrac bahorel lesgle or laigle joly grantaire 
 these young men formed a sort of family through the bond of friendship 
 all with the exception of laigle were from the south 
 this was a remarkable group 
 it vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us 
 at the point of this drama which we have now reached it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure 
 enjolras whose name we have mentioned first of reader shall see why later an only son and wealthy 
 enjolras was a charming young man who was capable of being terrible he was angelically handsome 
 he was a savage antinous 
 one would have said to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance that he had already in some previous state of existence traversed the revolutionary apocalypse 
 he possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness 
 he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair 
 a pontifical and warlike nature a singular thing in a youth 
 he was an officiating priest and a man of war from the immediate point of view a soldier of the democracy above the contemporary movement the priest of the ideal 
 his eyes were deep his lids a little red his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful his brow was lofty 
 a great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view 
 like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last who became illustrious at an early age he was endowed with excessive youth and was as rosy as a young girl although subject to hours of pallor already a man he still seemed a child 
 his two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen he was serious it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman he had but one right but one overthrow the obstacle 
 on mount aventine he would have been gracchus in the convention he would have been he hardly saw the roses he ignored spring he did not hear the carolling of the birds the bare throat of evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved aristogeiton he like harmodius thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword he was severe in his enjoyments 
 he chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the republic 
 he was the marble lover of liberty 
 his speech was harshly inspired and had the thrill of a hymn 
 he was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul woe to the which should have risked itself beside him if any grisette of the place cambrai or the rue seeing that face of a youth escaped from college that mien those long golden lashes those blue eyes that hair billowing in the wind those rosy cheeks those fresh lips those exquisite teeth had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora and had tried her beauty on enjolras an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of ezekiel with the gallant cherubino of beaumarchais 
 by the side of enjolras who represented the logic of the revolution combeferre represented its philosophy 
 between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this its logic may end in war whereas its philosophy can end only in peace combeferre complemented and rectified enjolras 
 he was less lofty but broader 
 he desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas 
 he said 
 revolution but civilization and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky the revolution was more adapted for breathing with combeferre than with enjolras 
 enjolras expressed its divine right and combeferre its natural right 
 the first attached himself to robespierre the second confined himself to condorcet 
 combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did enjolras if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history the one would have been the just the other the wise man enjolras was the more virile combeferre the more humane 
 homo and vir that was the exact effect of their different shades 
 combeferre was as gentle as enjolras was severe through natural whiteness he loved the word citizen but he preferred the word man 
 he would gladly have said 
 hombre like the spanish 
 he read everything went to the theatres attended the courses of public lecturers learned the polarization of light from arago grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which geoffrey explained the double function of the external carotid artery and the internal the one which makes the face and the one which makes the brain he kept up with what was going on followed science step by step compared with fourier deciphered hieroglyphics broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology drew from memory a silkworm moth pointed out the faulty french in the dictionary of the academy studied puysegur and deleuze affirmed nothing not even miracles denied nothing not even ghosts turned over the files of the moniteur reflected 
 he declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster and busied himself with educational questions 
 he desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level at coining science at putting ideas into circulation at increasing the mind in youthful persons and he feared lest the present poverty of method the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds 
 he was learned a purist exact a graduate of the polytechnic a close student and at the same time thoughtful even to chimaeras so his friends said he believed in all dreams railroads the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations the fixing of images in the dark chamber the electric telegraph the steering of balloons 
 moreover he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction by superstition despotism and prejudice he was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position 
 enjolras was a chief combeferre was a guide one would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other 
 it is not that combeferre was not capable of fighting he did not refuse a combat with the obstacle and to attack it by main force and explosively but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually by means of education the inculcation of axioms the promulgation of positive laws and between two lights his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration a conflagration can create an aurora no doubt but why not await the dawn 
 a volcano illuminates but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination 
 possibly combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime 
 a light troubled by smoke progress purchased at the expense of violence only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit 
 the headlong precipitation of a people into the truth a terrified him nevertheless stagnation was still more repulsive to him in it he detected putrefaction and death on the whole he preferred scum to miasma and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool and the falls of niagara to the lake of montfaucon 
 in short he desired neither halt nor haste 
 while his tumultuous friends captivated by the absolute adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures combeferre was inclined to let progress good progress take its own course he may have been cold but he was pure methodical but irreproachable phlegmatic but imperturbable 
 combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races 
 the good must be innocent he repeated incessantly and in fact if the grandeur of the revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings with fire and blood in its talons the beauty of progress lies in being spotless and there exists between washington who represents the one and danton who incarnates the other that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle 
 jean prouvaire was a still softer shade than combeferre 
 his name was jehan owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the middle ages 
 jean prouvaire was in love he cultivated a pot of flowers played on the flute made verses loved the people pitied woman wept over the child confounded god and the future in the same confidence and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head that of andre chenier his voice was ordinarily delicate but suddenly grew manly he was learned even to erudition and almost an orientalist above all he was good and a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur in the matter of poetry he preferred the immense 
 he knew italian latin greek and hebrew and these served him only for the perusal of four poets dante juvenal aeschylus and isaiah 
 in french he preferred corneille to racine and agrippa to corneille he loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events his mind had two attitudes one on the side towards man the other on that towards god he studied or he contemplated 
 all day long he buried himself in social questions salary capital credit marriage religion liberty of thought education penal servitude poverty association property production and sharing the enigma of this lower world which covers the human with darkness and at night he gazed upon the planets those enormous beings like enjolras he was wealthy and an only son 
 he spoke softly bowed his head lowered his eyes smiled with embarrassment dressed badly had an awkward air blushed at a mere nothing and was very timid 
 yet he was intrepid 
 feuilly was a workingman a orphaned both of father and mother who earned with difficulty three francs a day and had but one thought to deliver the world 
 he had one other preoccupation to educate himself he called this also delivering himself he had taught himself to read and write everything that he knew he had learned by himself 
 feuilly had a generous heart 
 the range of his embrace was immense 
 this orphan had adopted the peoples as his mother had failed him he meditated on his country he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people over what we now call the idea of the nationality had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case in this club of young utopians occupied chiefly with france he represented the outside world 
 he had for his specialty greece poland hungary roumania italy 
 he uttered these names incessantly appropriately and inappropriately with the tenacity of right the violations of turkey on greece and thessaly of russia on warsaw of austria on venice enraged him 
 above all things the great violence of aroused him 
 there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation he was eloquent with that eloquence 
 he was inexhaustible on that infamous date of on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason and that crime on that monstrous ambush the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states which since that time have struck many a noble nation and have annulled their certificate of birth so to speak all contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of poland 
 the partition of poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries 
 there has not been a despot nor a traitor for nearly a century back who has not signed approved and copied ne variatur the partition of poland when the record of modern treasons was examined that was the first thing which made its appearance 
 the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own 
 sounded the onset was the death of the game 
 such was habitual text this poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of justice and she recompensed him by rendering him great 
 the fact is that there is eternity in right 
 warsaw can no more be tartar than venice can be teuton 
 kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so 
 sooner or later the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears 
 greece becomes greece again italy is once more italy 
 the protest of right against the deed persists forever 
 the theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription 
 these lofty deeds of rascality have no future a nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief 
 courfeyrac had a father who was called m de courfeyrac 
 one of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle the particle as every one knows possesses no significance but the bourgeois of the epoch of la minerve estimated so highly that poor de that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it m de chauvelin had himself called m chauvelin m de caumartin m caumartin m de constant de robecque benjamin constant m de lafayette m lafayette 
 courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest and called himself plain courfeyrac 
 we might almost so far as courfeyrac is concerned stop here and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains for courfeyrac see tholomyes 
 courfeyrac had in fact that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind 
 later on this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten and all this grace ends with the bourgeois on two legs and with the tomcat on four paws 
 this sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools who pass it from hand to hand quasi cursores and is almost always exactly the same so that as we have just pointed out any one who had listened to courfeyrac in would have thought he heard tholomyes in 
 only courfeyrac was an honorable fellow beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind the difference between him and tholomyes was very great 
 the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second 
 there was in tholomyes a district attorney and in courfeyrac a paladin 
 enjolras was the chief combeferre was the guide courfeyrac was the centre 
 the others gave more light he shed more warmth the truth is that he possessed all the qualities of a centre roundness and radiance 
 bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of june on the occasion of the burial of young lallemand 
 bahorel was a mortal who kept bad company brave a spendthrift prodigal and to the verge of generosity talkative and at times eloquent bold to the verge of effrontery the best fellow possible he had daring waistcoats and scarlet opinions a wholesale blusterer that is to say loving nothing so much as a quarrel unless it were an uprising and nothing so much as an uprising unless it were a revolution always ready to smash a then to tear up the pavement then to demolish a government just to see the effect of it a student in his eleventh year he had nosed about the law but did not practise it 
 he had taken for his device 
 never a lawyer and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap 
 every time that he passed the which rarely happened he buttoned up his paletot had not yet been took hygienic precautions 
 of the school porter he said 
 what a fine old man and of the dean m delvincourt 
 what a monument in his lectures he espied subjects for ballads and in his professors occasions for caricature 
 he wasted a tolerably large allowance something like three thousand francs a year in doing nothing 
 he had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son 
 he said of them 
 they are peasants and not bourgeois that is the reason they are intelligent 
 bahorel a man of caprice was scattered over numerous cafes the others had habits he had none 
 he sauntered 
 to stray is human to saunter is parisian 
 in reality he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view 
 he served as a connecting link between the friends of the a b c and other still unorganized groups which were destined to take form later on 
 in this conclave of young heads there was one bald member 
 the marquis whom louis xviii 
 made a duke for having assisted him to enter a on the day when he emigrated was wont to relate that in on his return to france as the king was disembarking at calais a man handed him a petition 
 what is your request said the king 
 sire a 
 what is your name 
 
 the king frowned glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus 
 lesgle 
 this orthography touched the king and he began to smile 
 sire resumed the man with the petition i had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed lesgueules 
 this surname furnished my name 
 i am called lesgueules by contraction lesgle and by corruption this caused the king to smile broadly 
 later on he gave the man the posting office of meaux either intentionally or accidentally 
 the bald member of the group was the son of this lesgle or legle and he signed himself legle de meaux as an abbreviation his companions called him bossuet 
 bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow 
 his specialty was not to succeed in anything 
 as an offset he laughed at everything at five and twenty he was bald 
 his father had ended by owning a house and a field but he the son had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation 
 he had nothing left he possessed knowledge and wit but all he did miscarried everything failed him and everybody deceived him what he was building tumbled down on top of him 
 if he were splitting wood he cut off a finger 
 if he had a mistress he speedily discovered that he had a friend also 
 some misfortune happened to him every moment hence his joviality 
 he said 
 i live under falling tiles he was not easily astonished because for him an accident was what he had foreseen he took his bad luck serenely and smiled at the teasing of fate like a person who is listening to pleasantries he was poor but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible he soon reached his last sou never his last burst of laughter when adversity entered his doors he saluted this old acquaintance cordially he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname good day guignon he said to it 
 these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive 
 he was full of resources 
 he had no money but he found means when it seemed good to him to indulge in unbridled extravagance 
 one night he went so far as to eat a hundred francs in a supper with a wench which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy 
 pull off my boots you jade 
 bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bahorel 
 bossuet had not much domicile sometimes none at all he lodged now with one now with another most often with joly joly was studying medicine 
 he was two years younger than bossuet 
 joly was the malade imaginaire junior 
 what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor 
 at three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror 
 he affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south and the foot to the north so that at night the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe 
 during thunder storms he felt his pulse 
 otherwise he was the gayest of them all all these young maniacal puny merry incoherences lived in harmony together and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades who were prodigal of winged consonants called jolllly you may fly away on the four jean prouvaire said to him 
 wing 
 joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane which is an indication of a sagacious mind 
 all these young men who differed so greatly and who on the whole can only be discussed seriously held the same religion 
 progress 
 all were the direct sons of the french revolution 
 the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date 
 
 their fathers in the flesh had been either royalists doctrinaires it matters not what this confusion anterior to themselves who were young did not concern them at all the pure blood of principle ran in their veins 
 they attached themselves without intermediate shades to incorruptible right and absolute duty 
 affiliated and initiated they sketched out the ideal underground 
 among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds there was one sceptic 
 how came he there 
 by juxtaposition this name was grantaire and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus 
 r grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything 
 moreover he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the cafe lemblin and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the ermitage on the boulevard du maine spatchcocked chickens at mother excellent matelotes at the barriere de la cunette and a certain thin white wine at the barriere du com pat 
 he knew the best place for everything in addition boxing and and some dances and he was a thorough player 
 he was a tremendous drinker to boot he was inordinately homely 
 the prettiest of that day irma boissy enraged with his homeliness pronounced sentence on him as follows 
 grantaire is impossible but fatuity was not to be disconcerted 
 he stared tenderly and fixedly at all women with the air of saying to them all 
 if i only chose and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand 
 all those words 
 rights of the people rights of man the social contract the french revolution the republic democracy humanity civilization religion progress came very near to signifying nothing whatever to grantaire 
 he smiled at them scepticism that caries of the intelligence had not left him a single whole idea 
 he lived with irony 
 this was his axiom there is but one certainty my full glass 
 he sneered at all devotion in all parties the father as well as the brother robespierre junior as well as loizerolles 
 they are greatly in advance to be dead he exclaimed 
 he said of the crucifix 
 there is a gibbet which has been a success 
 a rover a gambler a libertine often drunk he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly les filles et le bon vin 
 air 
 vive henri iv 
 however this sceptic had one fanaticism 
 this fanaticism was neither a dogma nor an idea nor an art nor a science it was a man 
 enjolras 
 grantaire admired loved and venerated enjolras to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds 
 to the most absolute 
 in what manner had enjolras subjugated him 
 by his ideas 
 no by his character a phenomenon which is often observable 
 a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors 
 that which we lack attracts us 
 no one loves the light like the blind man the dwarf adores the the toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven 
 why 
 in order to watch the bird in its flight grantaire in whom writhed doubt loved to watch faith soar in enjolras he had need of enjolras 
 that chaste healthy firm upright hard candid nature charmed him without his being clearly aware of it and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him 
 he admired his opposite by instinct 
 his soft yielding dislocated sickly shapeless ideas attached themselves to enjolras as to a spinal column 
 his moral backbone leaned on that firmness grantaire in the presence of enjolras became some one once more he was himself moreover composed of two elements which were to all appearance incompatible 
 he was ironical and cordial his indifference loved 
 his mind could get along without belief but his heart could not get along without friendship a profound contradiction for an affection is a conviction his nature was thus constituted 
 there are men who seem to be born to be the reverse the obverse the wrong side 
 they are pollux patrocles nisus eudamidas ephestion pechmeja 
 they only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man their name is a sequel and is only written preceded by the conjunction and and their existence is not their own it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs 
 grantaire was one of these men he was the obverse of enjolras 
 one might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet 
 in the series o and p are inseparable 
 you can at will pronounce o and p or orestes and pylades 
 grantaire enjolras true satellite inhabited this circle of young men he lived there he took no pleasure anywhere but there he followed them everywhere 
 his joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of wine 
 they tolerated him on account of his good humor 
 enjolras the believer disdained this sceptic and a sober man himself scorned this drunkard 
 he accorded him a little lofty pity 
 grantaire was an unaccepted pylades 
 always harshly treated by enjolras roughly repulsed rejected yet ever returning to the charge he said of enjolras 
 what fine marble

 chapter xi 
 
 prince eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when count bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolkonski but not pausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as he went the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign chernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperor who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to the left was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excited italian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speak 
 and as for the man who advised forming this camp the drissa camp said paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince andrew scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sire continued paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself the man who advised the drissa camp i see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows 
 without heeding the end of the remarks and as though not hearing them the emperor recognizing bolkonski addressed him graciously 
 i am very glad to see you go in there where they are meeting and wait for me 
 the emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski and baron stein and the door closed behind them prince andrew taking advantage of the permission accompanied paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the council was assembled 
 prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position as it were of chief of the staff he came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to be false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to outflank the drissa camp 
 the first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the difficulty that presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the petersburg and moscow roads the reason for this was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have an opinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put which in fact his plan did not answer as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one as good as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take some disputed his arguments others defended them young count toll objected to the swedish views more warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a notebook which he asked permission to read to them in these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme totally different from or plan of campaign in answer to toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated 
 during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen his bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when prince volkonski who was in the chair called on him to give his opinion he merely said 
 why ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear or why not this italian attack very fine or a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves know everything better than i do 
 but when volkonski said with a frown that it was in the name that he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly growing animated began to speak 
 everything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought they knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters there is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers what is the difficulty nonsense childishness 
 he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed 
 paulucci who did not know german began questioning him in french wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke french badly and began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with pfuel who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but all that could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically he demonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in french every now and then turning to pfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily at his own supporter wolzogen 
 well of course what more is there to explain 
 paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french armfeldt addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volkonski in russian prince andrew listened and observed in silence 
 of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry determined and absurdly as he was of all those present evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed no hatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he was ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarks of all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in there was now a panic fear of genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him from every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling of respect pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew from the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation in own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuel himself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him 
 the discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes culminating in shouts and personalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shouts felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius now appeared to him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the armies will be in a time and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment sometimes when there is not a coward at the front to shout we are cut off and start running but a brave and jolly lad who shouts hurrah a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand as at schon grabern while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science can there be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half and paulucci says we have got the french army between two fires michaud says that the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it and pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength toll proposes one plan armfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial and why do they all speak of a military genius is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left it is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the best generals i have known were on the contrary stupid or men bagration was the best napoleon himself admitted that and of bonaparte himself i remember his limited face on the field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes love poetry tenderness and philosophic inquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficient patience and only then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he should be humane should love or pity or think of what is just and unjust it is understandable that a theory of their genius was invented for them long ago because they have power the success of a military action depends not on them but on the man in the ranks who shouts we are lost or who shouts hurrah and only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful 
 so thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and he roused himself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving 
 at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would like to serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the person but for permission to serve in the army

 funeral oration by bossuet 
 on a certain afternoon which had as will be seen hereafter some coincidence with the events heretofore related laigle de meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the cafe musain 
 he had the air of a caryatid on a vacation he carried nothing but his revery however 
 he was staring at the place to lean back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect which attitude is not hated by thinkers 
 laigle de meaux was pondering without melancholy over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the and which had modified his personal plans for the future plans which were rather indistinct in any case 
 revery does not prevent a cab from passing by nor the dreamer from taking note of that cab 
 laigle de meaux whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging perceived athwart his somnambulism a vehicle proceeding through the place at a foot pace and apparently in indecision for whom was this cabriolet 
 why was it driving at a walk laigle took a survey 
 in it beside the coachman sat a young man and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky the bag displayed to the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff 
 marius pontmercy 
 this name caused laigle to change his attitude 
 he drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet 
 monsieur marius pontmercy 
 the cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt 
 the young man who also seemed deeply buried in thought raised his eyes 
 hey said he 
 you are m marius pontmercy 
 certainly 
 i was looking for you resumed laigle de meaux 
 how so demanded marius for it was he 
 in fact he had just quitted his and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time 
 i do not know you 
 neither do i know you responded laigle 
 marius thought he had encountered a wag the beginning of a mystification in the open street 
 he was not in a very good humor at the moment he frowned 
 laigle de meaux went on imperturbably 
 you were not at the school day before yesterday 
 that is possible 
 that is certain 
 you are a student demanded marius 
 yes sir 
 like yourself 
 day before yesterday i entered the school by chance 
 you know one does have such freaks sometimes the professor was just calling the roll 
 you are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions 
 at the third call unanswered your name is erased from the list 
 sixty francs in the gulf 
 marius began to listen 
 it was blondeau who was making the call 
 you know blondeau he has a very pointed and very malicious nose and he delights to scent out the absent 
 he slyly began with the letter p i was not listening not being compromised by that letter 
 the call was not going badly no erasures the universe was present 
 blondeau was grieved i said to myself 
 blondeau my love you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution all at once blondeau calls marius pontmercy 
 no one answers 
 blondeau filled with hope repeats more loudly 
 marius pontmercy 
 and he takes his pen monsieur i have bowels of compassion 
 i said to myself hastily a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out 
 attention here is a veritable mortal who is not exact 
 not a good student here is none of your a student who studies a greenhorn pedant strong on letters theology science and sapience one of those dull wits cut by the square a pin by profession he is an honorable idler who lounges who practises country jaunts who cultivates the grisette who pays court to the fair sex who is at this very moment perhaps with my mistress 
 let us save him 
 death to blondeau 
 at that moment blondeau dipped his pen in all black with erasures in the ink cast his yellow eyes round the audience room and repeated for the third time marius pontmercy 
 i replied 
 present this is why you were not crossed off 
 monsieur said marius 
 and why i was added laigle de meaux 
 i do not understand you said marius 
 laigle resumed 
 nothing is more simple 
 i was close to the desk to reply and close to the door for the purpose of flight 
 the professor gazed at me with a certain intensity 
 all of a sudden blondeau who must be the malicious nose alluded to by boileau skipped to the letter l l is my letter 
 i am from meaux and my name is lesgle 
 interrupted marius what fine name 
 monsieur blondeau came to this fine name and called laigle i reply 
 present then blondeau gazes at me with the gentleness of a tiger and says to me 
 lf you are pontmercy you are not laigle 
 a phrase which has a disobliging air for you but which was lugubrious only for me 
 that said he crossed me off 
 marius exclaimed 
 i am mortified sir 
 first of all interposed laigle i demand permission to embalm blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium 
 i will assume that he is dead 
 there will be no great change required in his gauntness in his pallor in his coldness and in his smell and i say 
 erudimini qui judicatis terram 
 here lies blondeau blondeau the nose blondeau nasica the ox of discipline bos disciplinae the bloodhound of the password the angel of the who was upright square exact rigid honest and hideous god crossed him off as he crossed me off 
 marius resumed 
 i am very sorry 
 young man said laigle de meaux let this serve you as a lesson in future be exact 
 i really beg you a thousand pardons 
 do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again 
 i am extremely sorry 
 laigle burst out laughing 
 and i am delighted 
 i was on the brink of becoming a lawyer this erasure saves me 
 i renounce the triumphs of the bar i shall not defend the widow and i shall not attack the orphan no more toga no more stage 
 here is my erasure all ready for me it is to you that i am indebted for it monsieur pontmercy i intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you 
 where do you live 
 in this cab said marius 
 a sign of opulence retorted laigle calmly 
 i congratulate you you have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum 
 at that moment courfeyrac emerged from the cafe 
 marius smiled sadly 
 i have paid this rent for the last two hours and i aspire to get rid of it but there is a sort of history attached to it and i know where to go 
 come to my place sir said courfeyrac 
 i have the priority observed laigle but i have no home 
 hold your tongue bossuet said courfeyrac 
 bossuet said marius but i thought that your name was laigle 
 de meaux replied laigle by metaphor bossuet 
 courfeyrac entered the cab 
 coachman said he hotel de la 
 and that very evening marius found himself installed in a chamber of the hotel de la side by side with courfeyrac

 book nine 
 chapter xii 
 
 before the beginning of the campaign rostov had received a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of illness and the breaking off of her engagement to prince andrew which they explained by having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire from the army and return home on receiving this letter nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army but wrote to his parents that he was sorry natasha was ill and her engagement broken off and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes to sonya he wrote separately 
 adored friend of my soul he wrote nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country but now at the commencement of the campaign i should feel dishonored not only in my comrades eyes but in my own if i preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the fatherland but this shall be our last separation believe me directly the war is over if i am still alive and still loved by you i will throw up everything and fly to you to press you forever to my ardent breast 
 it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that prevented rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying sonya the autumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmas holidays and love had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before and which now allured him a splendid wife children a good pack of hounds a dozen leashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service by election thought he but now the campaign was beginning and he had to remain with his regiment and since it had to be so nicholas rostov as was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life 
 on his return from his furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders during his absence he had been promoted captain and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers he was again allotted his old squadron 
 the campaign began the regiment was moved into poland on double pay new officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war and rostov conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them 
 the troops retired from vilna for various complicated reasons of state political and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests arguments and passions at headquarters for the pavlograd hussars however the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business 
 it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness and intriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why if they regretted having to retreat it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to or some pretty young polish lady if the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter head he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs but only of the task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vilna making acquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the emperor and other high commanders then came an order to retreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there and because many complaints were made against the troops who taking advantage of the order to collect provisions took also horses carriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostov remembered sventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrels of old beer from sventsyani they retired farther and farther to drissa and thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier of russia proper 
 on the thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious action for the first time 
 on the twelfth of july on the eve of that action there was a heavy storm of rain and hail in general the summer of l was remarkable for its storms 
 the two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses the rain was descending in torrents and rostov with a young officer named ilyin his protege was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter an officer of their regiment with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain entered shelter 
 i have come from the staff count have you heard of exploit 
 and the officer gave them details of the saltanov battle which he had heard at the staff 
 rostov smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled down his neck listened inattentively with an occasional glance at ilyin who was pressing close to him this officer a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment was now in the same relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven years before ilyin tried to imitate rostov in everything and adored him as a girl might have done 
 zdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently of the saltanov dam being a russian thermopylae and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by general raevski he recounted how raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him rostov heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage enthusiasm but on the contrary looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing though with no intention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides that he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with his mustaches extending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as was his habit and crowded rostov in the narrow shanty rostov looked at him in silence in the first place there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if raevski did lead his sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or with whom raevski came onto the dam and even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do with tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they took the saltanov dam or not as we are told was the case at thermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why expose his own children in the battle i would not have taken my brother petya there or even ilyin a stranger to me but a nice lad but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas continued to think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly 
 i stand this any more said ilyin noticing that rostov did not relish conversation my stockings and shirt and the water is running on my seat go and look for shelter the rain seems less heavy 
 ilyin went out and zdrzhinski rode away 
 five minutes later ilyin splashing through the mud came running back to the shanty 
 hurrah rostov come quick found it about two hundred yards away a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get dry there and mary there 
 mary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty young german woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers 
 rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders shouted to lavrushka to follow with the things and now slipping in the mud now splashing right through it set off with ilyin in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning 
 rostov where are you 
 here what lightning they called to one another

 of superstition 
 it were better to have no opinion of god at all than such an opinion as is unworthy of him for the one is unbelief the other is contumely 
 and certainly superstition is the reproach of the deity plutarch saith well to that 
 purpose 
 surely saith he i had rather a great deal men should say there was no 
 such man at all as plutarch than that they should say that there was one plutarch that would eat his children as soon as they were born as the poets speak of saturn 
 and as the contumely is greater towards god so the danger is greater towards men atheism leaves a man to sense to philosophy to natural piety 
 to laws to reputation all which may be guides to an outward moral virtue though religion were not but superstition dismounts all these and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the minds of men 
 therefore atheism did never perturb states for it makes men wary of themselves as looking no further and we see the times inclined to atheism 
 as the time of augustus caesar were civil times but superstition halh been the 
 conclusion of many states and bringeth in a new primum mobile that ravisheth all the spheres of government the master of superstition is the people and in all 
 superstition wise men follow fools and arguments are fitted to practice in a 
 reversed order it was gravely said by some of the prelates in the council of trent where the doctrine of the schoolmen bare great sway that the schoolmen were like astronomers which did feign eccentrics and epicycles and such engines of orbs to save me phenomena though they knew there were no such things and in like manner that the schoolmen had framed a number of subtle and intricate axioms and theorems to save the practice of the church 
 the causes of superstition are pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies excess of outward and pharisaical holiness reverence of traditions which cannot but load the church the stratagems of prelates for ambition and lucre the favouring too much of good intentions which openeth the gate to conceits and novelties the taking an aim at divine matters by human which cannot but breed mixture of imaginations and lastly barbarous times 
 especially joined with calamities and disasters superstition without a veil is 
 a deformed thing for as it addeth deformity to an ape to be so like a man so the similitude of superstition to religion makes it the more deformed and as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms so good forms and orders corrupt into a number of petty observances 
 there is a superstition in avoiding superstition when men think to do best if they go furthest from the superstition formerly received therefore care would be had that as it fareth in ill purgings the good be not taken away with the bad which commonly is done when he people is the reformer

 book fall 
 chapter ii 
 
 prudence counselled to wisdom 
 that evening the bishop of d after his promenade through the town remained shut up rather late in his room 
 he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately 
 he was carefully compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject 
 his book was divided into two parts 
 firstly the duties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the class to which he belongs the duties of all are the great duties 
 there are four of these saint matthew points them out 
 duties towards god matt vi duties towards self matt v duties towards neighbor matt vii duties towards animals matt vi as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere 
 to sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to young men by saint peter to husbands fathers children and servants in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews to virgins in the epistle to the corinthians out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls 
 at eight he was still at work writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper with a big book open on his knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the from the cupboard near his bed 
 a moment later the bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him shut his book rose from his table and entered the 
 the was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on the garden 
 madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the table 
 as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle baptistine 
 a lamp stood on the table the table was near the fireplace a wood fire was burning there 
 one can easily picture to self these two women both of whom were over sixty years of age 
 madame magloire small plump vivacious mademoiselle baptistine gentle slender frail somewhat taller than her brother dressed in a gown of silk of the fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted ever since 
 to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptistine that of a lady madame magloire wore a white quilted cap a gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff with large short sleeves an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks knotted round the waist with a green ribbon with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners coarse shoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles 
 mademoiselle gown was cut on the patterns of with a short waist a narrow skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons she concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look 
 so long as monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like her mistress 
 mademoiselle baptistine did not even speak 
 she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and a long arched nose but her whole visage her whole person breathed forth an ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning 
 she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues which mildly warm the soul had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity 
 nature had made her a lamb religion had made her an angel 
 poor sainted virgin sweet memory which has vanished 
 mademoiselle baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details 
 at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity 
 she was haranguing mademoiselle baptistine on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed 
 the question concerned the lock upon the entrance door 
 it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places 
 people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters 
 the police was very badly organized moreover because there was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure each other by making things happen it behooved wise people to play the part of their own police and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to duly close bar and barricade their houses and to fasten the doors well 
 madame magloire emphasized these last words but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold 
 he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and then fell to thinking of other things 
 he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire 
 she repeated it 
 then mademoiselle baptistine desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother ventured to say timidly 
 did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother 
 i have heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop then in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the what is the matter 
 what is the matter are we in any great danger 
 then madame magloire began the whole story afresh exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact 
 it appeared that a bohemian a vagabond a sort of dangerous mendicant was at that moment in the town 
 he had presented himself at jacquin to obtain lodgings but the latter had not been willing to take him in 
 he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming a with a terrible face 
 really said the bishop 
 this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire it seemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed she pursued triumphantly 
 yes monseigneur 
 that is how it is 
 there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town every one says so 
 and withal the police is so badly regulated a useful repetition the idea of living in a mountainous country and not even having lights in the streets at night 
 one goes out 
 black as ovens indeed and i say monseigneur and mademoiselle there says with me 
 i interrupted his sister say nothing 
 what my brother does is well done 
 madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest 
 we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will permit i will go and tell paulin musebois the locksmith to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors we have them and it is only the work of a moment for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first and i say that we need bolts monseigneur if only for this night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in and besides even in the middle of the night o mon dieu there is no need to ask permission 
 at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door 
 come in said the bishop

 the empire strikes back 
 iii 
 
 stood just outside the entrance to the secret rebel ice hangar dustedwith a layer of snow that had settled over his body his inner timingmechanisms knew he had waited here a long time and his optical sensor told him thatthe sky was dark 
 but the r unit was concerned only with his that were stillsending signals across the ice fields his long and earnest for themissing luke skywalker and han solo had not turned up a thing 
 the stout droid began beeping nervously when threepio approached stiffly through the snow 
 artoo the robot inclined the upper half of his form at the hipjoints nothing more you can do you must come inside threepiostraightened to his full height again simulating a human shiver as the night windshowled past his gleaming hull artoo my joints are freezing up will youhurryplease but before he could finish his own sentence threepio washurrying back toward the hangar entrance 
 sky was then entirely black with night and princess leia organa stoodinside the rebel base entrance maintaining a worried vigil she shivered in thenight wind as she tried to see into the hoth darkness waiting near a deeplyconcerned major derlin her mind was somewhere out on the ice fields 
 the giant wookiee sat nearby his maned head lifting quickly from his hairyhands as the two droids threepio and artoo reentered the hangar 
 threepio was humanly distraught artoo has not been able to pick up anysignals he reported fretting although he feels his range is probably too limited tocause us to give up hope still very little confidence could be detected artificial voice 
 leia gave the taller droid a nod of acknowledgment but did not speak herthoughts were occupied with the pair of missing heroes most disturbing to her wasthat she found her mind focused on one of the two a corellian whosewords were not always to be taken literally 
 as the princess kept watch major derlin turned to acknowledge a rebellieutenant reporting in all patrols are now in except solo and skywalker sir 
 the major looked over at princess leia your highness he said his voiceweighty with regret nothing more can be done tonight the temperature isdropping fast the shield doors must be closed sorry derlin waited amoment then addressed the lieutenant close the doors 
 the rebel officer turned to carry out order and immediately thechamber of ice seemed to drop even more in temperature as the mournful wookieehowled his grief 
 the speeders should be ready in the morning the major said to make the search easier 
 not really expecting an affirmative reply leia asked is there any chance oftheir surviving until the morning 
 slim major derlin answered with grim honesty but yes a chance 
 in response to the words artoo began to operate the miniaturecomputers inside his metal body taking only moments to juggle numeroussets of mathematical computations and climaxing his figurings with a series oftriumphant beeps 
 threepio interpreted artoo says the chances against survival areseven hundred to one then tilting toward the shorter robot theprotocol droid grumbled actually i think we needed to know that 
 no one responded to translation for several prolonged momentsthere was a solemn silence broken only by the echoing clang of metal slammingagainst metal the huge doors of the rebel base were closed for the night it was asif some heartless deity had officially severed the assembled group from the two menout on the ice plains and had with a metallic bang announced their deaths 
 chewbacca led out another suffering howl 
 and a silent prayer often spoken on an erstwhile world called alderaan creptinto thoughts 
 the sun that was creeping over northern horizon was relatively dim butits light was enough to shed some warmth on the icy surface the lightcrawled across the rolling hills of snow fought to reach the darker recesses of the icygorges then finally came to rest on what must have been the only perfect whitemound on the entire world 
 so perfect was the mound that it must have owed its existence tosome power other than nature then as the sky grew steadily brighter this moundbegan to hum anyone observing the mound now would have been startled as thesnow dome seemed to erupt sending its snowy outer covering skyward in a greatburst of white particles a droning machine began pulling back its retractable sensorarms and its awesome bulks slowly rose from its frozen white bed 
 the probe robot paused briefly in the windy air then continued on its morningmission across the plains 
 something else had invaded the morning air of the ice relatively craft with dark cockpit windows and laser guns mounted on each rebel snowspeeder was heavily armored and designed for warfare near surface but this morning the small craft was on a reconnaissance above the expansive white landscape and arcing over the contours of thesnowdrifts 
 although the snowspeeder was designed for a crew zev was the occupant his eyes took in a panoramic scan of the desolate stretches he prayed that he would find the objects of his search before he went 
 presently he heard a low beeping signal 
 echo base he shouted jubilantly into his cockpit comlink got much but it could be a sign of life sector by closing in 
 frantically working the controls of his ship zev reduced its speed slightly andbanked the craft over a snowdrift he welcomed the sudden pressing himagainst his seat and headed the snowspeeder in the direction of the faint signal 
 as the white infinity of terrain streaked under him the rebel pilotswitched his comlink to a new frequency echo three this is rogue two doyou copy commander skywalker this is rogue two 
 the only reply that came through his comlink receiver was static 
 but then he heard a voice a very voice fighting its waythrough the crackling noise nice of you guys to drop by hope we get youup too early 
 zev welcomed the characteristic cynicism in han voice he switched histransmitter back to the hidden rebel base echo base this is rogue two hereported his voice suddenly rising in pitch i found them repeat 
 as he spoke the pilot pulled in a fix on the signals winking on hiscockpit monitor screens then he further reduced the speed of his craft bringing itdown close enough to the surface so that he could better see a small objectstanding out against the fleecy plains 
 the object a portable shelter sat atop a snowdrift on the side was a layer of white and resting gingerly against theupper part of the snowdrift was a makeshift radio antenna 
 but a more welcome sight than any of this was the familiar human figurestanding in front of the snow shelter frantically waving his arms at the snowspeeder 
 as zev dipped his craft for a landing he felt overwhelmingly grateful that atleast one of the warriors he had been sent out to find was still alive 
 only a thick glass window separated the battered body of lukeskywalker from four of his watchful friends 
 han solo who appreciated the relative warmth of the rebel medical center wasstanding beside leia his wookiee copilot and hanexhaled with relief he knew that despite the grim atmosphere of the chamberenclosing him the young commander was finally out of danger and in the best ofmechanical hands 
 clad only in white shorts luke hung in a vertical position inside a transparentcylinder with a combination breath mask and microphone covering his nose andmouth the surgeon droid was attending to the youth with the skill ofthe finest humanoid doctors he was aided by his medical assistant droid looked like nothing more than a set of cylinders wires andappendages gracefully the surgeon droid worked a switch that brought a gelatinousred fluid pouring down over his human patient this bacta han knew could workmiracles even with patients in such dire shape as luke 
 as the bubbling slime encapsulated his body luke began to thrash about andrave deliriously watch out he moaned snow to yodaonly hope 
 han had not the slightest idea what his friend was raving about perplexed by the babbling expressed himself with an interrogativewookiee bark 
 he make sense to me either chewie han replied 
 threepio commented hopefully i do hope all there if you take mymeaning it would be most unfortunate if master luke were to develop a shortcircuit 
 the kid ran into something han observed and it justthe cold 
 those creatures he keeps talking about leia said looking at the grimlystaring solo doubled the security han she began tentatively trying tothank him i know how 
 forget it he said brusquely right now he was concerned only with hisfriend in the red bacta fluid 
 body sloshed through the brightly colored substance the healingproperties by now taking effect for a while it appeared as if luke were trying toresist the curative flow of the translucent muck then at last he gave up hismumbling and relaxed succumbing to the powers 
 turned away from the human who had been entrusted to his angled his head to gaze at han and the others through the skywalker has been in but is responding well to thebacta the robot announced his commanding authoritative voice heard distinctlythough the glass he is now out of danger 
 the surgeon words immediately wiped away the tension that had seizedthe group on the other side of the window leia sighed in relief and chewbaccagrunted his approval of treatment 
 luke had no way of estimating how long he had been delirious but now hewas in full command of his mind and senses he sat up on his bed in the rebelmedical center what a relief he thought to be breathing real air again howevercold it might be 
 a medical droid was removing the protective pad from his healing face hiseyes were uncovered and he was beginning to perceive the face of someone standingby his bed gradually threepio smiling image of princess leia came into gracefully moved toward him and gently brushed his hair out of his eyes 
 the bacta are growing well she said as she looked at his healing scars should be gone in a day or so does it still hurt you 
 across the room the door banged open artoo beeped in a cheerful greeting ashe rolled toward luke and threepio clanked noisily toward bed masterluke good to see you functional again 
 thanks threepio 
 artoo emitted a series of happy beeps and whistles 
 artoo expresses his relief also threepio translated helpfully 
 luke was certainly grateful for the robots concern but before he could replyto either of the droids he met with yet another interruption 
 hi kid han solo greeted him boisterously as he and chewbacca burst into themedical center 
 the wookiee growled a friendly greeting 
 you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark han observed 
 luke felt that strong and felt grateful to his friend thanks to you 
 two you owe me junior han gave the princess a wide devilish your worship he said mockingly it looks like you arranged to keep meclose by for a while longer 
 i had nothing to do with it leia said hotly annoyed at rieekan thinks dangerous for any ships to leave the system until thegenerators are operational 
 that makes a good story but i think you just bear to let me out of yoursight 
 i know where you get your delusions laser brains she retorted 
 chewbacca amused by this verbal battle between two of the strongest humanwills he had ever encountered let out a roaring wookiee laugh 
 laugh it up fuzz ball han said you see us alone inthe south passage 
 until now luke had scarcely listened to this lively exchange han and theprincess had argued frequently enough in the past but that reference to the southpassage sparked his curiosity and he looked at leia for an explanation 
 she expressed her true feeling for me han continued delighting in the rosyflush that appeared on the cheeks come on your highness forgotten 
 why you shesputtered in fury 
 he grinned i tell ya sweetheart i hitpretty close to the mark to get you hoppin like this it look that way to 
 yeah he said staring at the princess incredulously it doeskind of 
 leia looked over at luke with a strange mixture of emotions showing on herflushed face something vulnerable almost childlike was reflected in her eyes for amoment and then the tough mask fell again 
 oh it does does it she said well i guess you understand everythingabout women do you 
 luke agreed silently he agreed even more when in the next moment leialeaned over and kissed him firmly on the lips then she turned on her heel andmarched across the room slamming the door behind her everyone in wookiee and at one another speechless 
 in the distance a warning alarm blared through the subterranean corridors 
 general rieekan and his head controller were conferring in the revel commandcenter when han solo and chewbacca burst into the room princess leia andthreepio who had been listening to the general and his officer turned in anticipationat their approach 
 a warning signal blared across the chamber from the huge console locatedbehind rieekan and monitored by rebel control officers 
 general the sensor controller called 
 grimly attentive general rieekan watched the console screens suddenly hesaw a flashing signal that had not been there a moment before princess he think we have a visitor 
 leia han chewbacca and threepio gathered around the general and watchedthe beeping monitor screens 
 picked up something outside the base in zone twelve movingeast said rieekan 
 whatever it is metal the sensor controller observed 
 eyes widened in surprise then it be one of those creatures thatattacked luke 
 could it be ours han asked a speeder 
 the sensor controller shook his head no no signal then came asound from another monitor wait something very weak 
 walking as rapidly as his stiff joints allowed threepio approached the auditory sensors turned in the strange signals i must say sir fluent in oversixty million forms of communication but this is something new must be in a codeor 
 just then the voice of a rebel trooper cut in through the comlinkspeaker this is echo station unidentified object is in our just over the ridge we should have visual contact in about withoutwarning the voice filled with fear what the oh no 
 a burst of radio static followed then the transmission broke off completely 
 han frowned whatever it is he said it friendly have a on chewie 
 even before han and chewbacca were out of the chamber general rieekan haddispatched rogues ten and eleven to station 
 the mammoth imperial star destroyer occupied a position of deadly prominencein the fleet the sleekly elongated ship was larger and even moreominous than the five imperial star destroyers guarding it togetherthese six cruisers were the most dreaded and devastating warships in the of reducing to cosmic scrap anything that stayed too close to their weapons 
 flanking the star destroyers were a number of smaller fighter ships and dartingabout this great space armada were the infamous tie fighters 
 supreme confidence reigned in the heart of every crew member in this imperialdeath squadron especially among the personnel on the monstrous central stardestroyer but something also blazed within their souls of merely thesound of the familiar heavy footsteps as they echoed through the enormous members dreaded these footfalls and shuddered whenever they were heardapproaching brining their much feared but much respected leader 
 towering above them in his black cloak and concealing black headgear darthvader dark lord of sith entered the main control deck and the men around him fellsilent in what seemed to be an endless moment no sound except those from control boards and the loud wheezes coming from the ebony metalbreath screen were to be heard 
 as darth vader watched the endless array of stars captain piett rushed acrossthe wide bridge of the ship carrying a message for the squat admiralozzel who was stationed on the bridge i think found something announced nervously looking from ozzel to the dark lord 
 yes captain the admiral was a supremely confident man who felt relaxedin the presence of his cloaked superior 
 the report we have is only a fragment from a probe droid in the hoth the best lead had in 
 we have had thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy ozzel broke inangrily i want proof not leads i intend to continue to chase around fromone side of 
 abruptly the figure in black approached the two and interrupted you foundsomething he asked his voice somewhat distorted by the breath mask 
 captain piett respectfully gazed at his master who loomed above him like omnipotent god yes sir piett said slowly choosing his words withcaution we have visuals the system is supposed to be devoid of humanforms 
 but vader was no longer listening to the captain his masked face turnedtoward an image beamed on one of the image of a small squadron ofrebel snowspeeders streaking above the white fields 
 it darth vader boomed without further deliberation 
 my lord admiral ozzel protested there are so many uncharted could be smugglers 
 that is the one the former jedi knight insisted clenching a skywalker is with them bring in the patrol ships admiral and set yourcourse for the hoth system vader looked toward an officer wearing a green uniformwith matching cap general veers the dark lord addressed him prepare yourmen 
 as soon as darth vader had spoken his men set about to launch his fearful plan 
 the imperial probe droid raised a large antenna from its buglike head and sentout a piercing signal the scanners had reacted to a lifeformhidden behind a great dune of snow and noted the appearance of a brown wookieehead and the sound of a growl the blasters that had been built intothe probe robot took aim at the furry giant but before the robot had a chance to red beam from a hand blaster exploded from behind the imperial probe droid andnicked its darkly finished hull 
 as he ducked behind a large snow dune han solo noticed chewbacca stillhidden and then watched the robot spun around in midair to face him so far theruse was working and now he was the target han had barely moved out of range asthe floating machine fired blasting chunks of snow from the edge of his dune hefired again hitting it square on with the beam of his weapon then he heard whine coming from the deadly machine and in an instant the imperialprobe droid burst into a billion or more flaming pieces 
 afraid not much left han said over the comlink as he concludedhis report to the underground base 
 princess leia and general rieekan were still manning the console where theyhad maintained constant communication with han what is it leia asked

 chapter xvii 
 
 after anna mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov countess rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she rang 
 what is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes you wish to serve me then find you another place 
 the countess was upset by her sorrow and humiliating poverty and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness 
 i am very sorry answered the maid 
 ask the count to come to me 
 the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual 
 well little countess what a saute of game au madere we are to have my dear i tasted it the thousand rubles i paid for taras were not he is worth it 
 he sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair 
 what are your commands little countess 
 you see my dear that mess she said pointing to his waistcoat the saute most likely she added with a smile well you see count i want some money 
 her face became sad 
 oh little countess and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook 
 i want a great deal count i want five hundred rubles and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her waistcoat 
 yes immediately immediately hey there he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons send dmitri to me 
 dmitri a man of good family who had been brought up in the house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the room 
 this is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential young man who had entered bring me he reflected a moment yes bring me seven hundred rubles yes but mind bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones for the countess 
 yes dmitri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply 
 when would you like them your excellency asked dmitri allow me to inform you but be uneasy he added noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger i was forgetting do you wish it brought at once 
 yes yes just so bring it give it to the countess 
 what a treasure that dmitri is added the count with a smile when the young man had departed there is never any impossible with him a thing i hate everything is possible 
 ah money count money how much sorrow it causes in the world said the countess but i am in great need of this sum 
 you my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count and having kissed his hand he went back to his study 
 when anna mikhaylovna returned from count the money all in clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table and anna mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her 
 well my dear asked the countess 
 oh what a terrible state he is in one would not know him he is so ill i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word 
 annette for sake refuse me the countess began with a blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and she took the money from under the handkerchief 
 anna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment 
 this is for boris from me for his outfit 
 anna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess wept too they wept because they were friends and because they were kindhearted and because they friends from childhood had to think about such a base thing as money and because their youth was over but those tears were pleasant to them both

 chapter 
 
 that friday made the last of our fine days for a month in the evening the weather broke the wind shifted from south to northeast and brought rain first and then sleet and snow on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts the larks were silent the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened and dreary and chill and dismal that morrow did creep over my master kept his room i took possession of the lonely parlour converting it into a nursery and there i was sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee rocking it to and fro and watching meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window when the door opened and some person entered out of breath and laughing my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute i supposed it one of the maids and i cried 
 have done how dare you show your giddiness here what would mr linton say if he heard you 
 excuse me answered a familiar voice but i know edgar is in bed and i cannot stop myself 
 with that the speaker came forward to the fire panting and holding her hand to her side 
 i have run the whole way from wuthering heights she continued after a pause except where flown i count the number of falls had oh aching all over be alarmed there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe 
 the intruder was mrs heathcliff she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament her hair streamed on her shoulders dripping with snow and water she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore befitting her age more than her position a low frock with short sleeves and nothing on either head or neck the frock was of light silk and clung to her with wet and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers add to this a deep cut under one ear which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely a white face scratched and bruised and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her 
 my dear young lady i exclaimed stir nowhere and hear nothing till you have removed every article of your clothes and put on dry things and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton tonight so it is needless to order the carriage 
 certainly i shall she said walking or riding yet no objection to dress myself decently see how it flows down my neck now the fire does make it smart 
 she insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments 
 now ellen she said when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy chair on the hearth with a cup of tea before her you sit down opposite me and put poor baby away i like to see it you think i care little for catherine because i behaved so foolishly on entering cried too more than anyone else has reason to cry we parted unreconciled you remember and i forgive myself but for all that i was not going to sympathize with brute beast oh give me the poker this is the last thing of his i have about me she slipped the gold ring from her third finger and threw it on the floor smash it she continued striking it with childish spite and then burn it and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals there he shall buy another if he gets me back again be capable of coming to seek me to tease edgar i dare not stay lest that notion should possess his wicked head and besides edgar has not been kind has he and i come suing for his assistance nor will i bring him into more trouble necessity compelled me to seek shelter here though if i had not learned he was out of the way have halted at the kitchen washed my face warmed myself got you to bring what i wanted and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my that incarnate goblin ah he was in such a fury if he had caught me a pity earnshaw is not his match in strength i have run till seen him all but demolished had hindley been able to do it 
 well talk so fast miss i interrupted disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face and make the cut bleed again drink your tea and take breath and give over laughing laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition 
 an undeniable truth she replied listen to that child it maintains a constant it out of my hearing for an hour i stay any longer 
 i rang the bell and committed it to a care and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight and where she meant to go as she refused remaining with us 
 i ought and i wish to remain answered she to cheer edgar and take care of the baby for two things and because the grange is my right home but i bell you he let me do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry and could bear to think that we were tranquil and not resolve on poisoning our comfort now i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within earshot or eyesight i notice when i enter his presence the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him and partly from original aversion it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england supposing i contrived a clear escape and therefore i must get quite away recovered from my first desire to be killed by him rather kill himself he has extinguished my love effectually and so at my ease i can recollect yet how i loved him and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him no even if he had doted on me the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly knowing him so well monster would that he could be blotted out of creation and out of my memory 
 hush hush a human being i said be more charitable there are worse men than he is yet 
 not a human being she retorted and he has no claim on my charity i gave him my heart and he took and pinched it to death and flung it back to me people feel with their hearts ellen and since he has destroyed mine i have not power to feel for him and i would not though he groaned from this to his dying day and wept tears of blood for catherine no indeed indeed i and here isabella began to cry but immediately dashing the water from her lashes she recommenced you asked what has driven me to flight at last i was compelled to attempt it because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity pulling out the nerves with pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of and proceeded to murderous violence i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of so i fairly broke free and if ever i come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge 
 yesterday you know mr earnshaw should have been at the funeral he kept himself sober for the sober not going to bed mad at six and getting up drunk at twelve consequently he rose in suicidal low spirits as fit for the church as for a dance and instead he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls 
 shudder to name him has been a stranger in the house from last sunday till today whether the angels have fed him or his kin beneath i cannot tell but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week he has just come home at dawn and gone upstairs to his chamber locking himself if anybody dreamt of coveting his company there he has continued praying like a methodist only the deity he implored in senseless dust and ashes and god when addressed was curiously confounded with his own black father after concluding these precious they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his would be off again always straight down to the grange edgar did not send for a constable and give him into custody for me grieved as i was about catherine it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday 
 i recovered spirits sufficient to hear eternal lectures without weeping and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly you think that i should cry at anything joseph could say but he and hareton are detestable companions rather sit with hindley and hear his awful talk than with t little maister and his staunch supporter that odious old man when heathcliff is in often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers when he is not as was the case this week i establish a table and chair at one comer of the house fire and never mind how mr earnshaw may occupy himself and he does not interfere with my arrangements he is quieter now than he used to be if no one provokes him more sullen and depressed and less furious joseph affirms sure an altered man that the lord has touched his heart and he is saved so as by fire puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change but it is not my business 
 i sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve it seemed so dismal to go upstairs with the wild snow blowing outside and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the grave i dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place hindley sat opposite his head leant on his hand perhaps meditating on the same subject he had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours there was no sound through the house but the moaning wind which shook the windows every now and then the faint crackling of the coals and the click of my snuffers as i removed at intervals the long wick of the candle hareton and joseph were probably fast asleep in bed it was very very sad and while i read i sighed for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world never to be restored 
 the doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual owing i suppose to the sudden storm that entrance was fastened and we beard him coming round to get in by the other i rose with an irrepressible expression of what i felt on my lips which induced my companion who had been staring towards the door to turn and look at me 
 keep him out five minutes he exclaimed you object 
 no you may keep him out the whole night for me i answered do put the key in the lock and draw the bolts 
 earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table leaning over it and searching in my eyes a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his as he both looked and felt like an assassin he exactly find that but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak 
 you and i he said have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder if we were neither of us cowards we might combine to discharge it are you as soft as your brother are you willing to endure to the last and not once attempt a repayment 
 weary of enduring now i replied and be glad of a retaliation that recoil on myself but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies 
 treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence cried hindley mrs heathcliff ask you to do nothing but sit still and be dumb tell me now can you sure you would have as much pleasure as i in witnessing the conclusion of the existence be your death unless you overreach him and be my ruin damn the hellish villain he knocks at the door as if he were master here already promise to hold your tongue and before that clock wants three minutes of a free woman 
 he took the implements which i described to you in my letter from his breast and would have turned down the candle i snatched it away however and seized his arm 
 not hold my tongue i said you touch him let the door remain shut and be quiet 
 no formed my resolution and by god execute it cried the desperate being do you a kindness in spite of yourself and hareton justice and you trouble your head to screen me catherine is gone nobody alive would regret me or be ashamed though i cut my throat this time to make an end 
 i might as well have struggled with a bear or reasoned with a lunatic the only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him 
 better seek shelter somewhere else tonight i exclaimed in a rather triumphant tone mr earnshaw has a mind to shoot you if you persist in endeavouring to enter 
 better open the door answered addressing me by some elegant term that i care to repeat 
 i shall not meddle in the matter i retorted again come in and get shot if you please done my duty 
 with that i shut the window and returned to my place by the fire having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him earnshaw swore passionately at me affirming that i loved the villain yet and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit i evinced and i in my secret heart and conscience never reproached me thought what a blessing it would be for him should heathcliff put him out of misery and what a blessing for me should he send heathcliff to his right abode as i sat nursing these reflections the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual and his black countenance liked blightingly through the stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow and i smiled exulting in my fancied security his hair and clothes were whitened with snow and his sharp cannibal teeth revealed by cold and wrath gleamed through the dark 
 isabella let me in or make you repent he girned as joseph calls it 
 i cannot commit murder i replied mr hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol 
 let me in by the kitchen door he said 
 hindley will be there before you i answered and a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow we were left at peace on our beds as long as the summer moon shone but the moment a blast of winter returns you must run for shelter heathcliff if i were you go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog the world is surely not worth living in now is it you had distinctly impressed on me the idea that catherine was the whole joy of your life i imagine how you think of surviving her loss 
 there is he exclaimed my companion rushing to the gap if i can get my arm out i can hit him 
 afraid ellen set me down as really wicked but you know all so judge i have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for anything wish that he were dead i must and therefore i was fearfully disappointed and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech when he flung himself on weapon and wrenched it from his grasp 
 the and the knife in springing back closed into its owners wrist heathcliff pulled it away by main force slitting up the flesh as it passed on and thrust it dripping into his pocket he then took a stone struck down the division between two windows and sprang in his adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery or a large vein the ruffian kicked and trampled on him and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags holding me with one hand meantime to prevent me summoning joseph he exerted preterhuman in abstaining from finishing him completely but getting out of breath he finally desisted and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle there he tore off the sleeve of coat and bound up the wound with brutal roughness spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before being at liberty i lost no time in seeking the old servant who having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale hurried below gasping as he descended the steps two at once 
 what is there to do now what is there to do now 
 this to do thundered heathcliff that your mad and should he last another month have him to an asylum and how the devil did you come to fasten me out you toothless hound stand muttering and mumbling there come not going to nurse him wash that stuff away and mind the sparks of your is more than half brandy 
 and so been murthering on him exclaimed joseph lifting his hands and eyes in horror if iver i seed a seeght loike this may the lord 
 heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood and flung a towel to him but instead of proceeding to dry it up he joined his hands and began a prayer which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology i was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing in fact i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows 
 oh i forgot you said the tyrant you shall do that down with you and you conspire with him against me do you viper there that is work fit for you 
 he shook me till my teeth rattled and pitched me beside joseph who steadily concluded his supplications and then rose vowing he would set off for the grange directly mr linton was a magistrate and though he had fifty wives dead he should inquire into this he was so obstinate in his resolution that heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place standing over me heaving with malevolence as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that heathcliff was not the aggressor especially with my hardly wrung replies however mr earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness heathcliff aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible called him deliriously intoxicated and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further but advised him to get to bed to my joy he left us after giving this judicious counsel and hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone i departed to my own room marvelling that i had escaped so easily 
 this morning when i came down about half an hour before noon mr earnshaw was sitting by the fire deadly sick his evil genius almost as gaunt and ghastly leant against the chimney neither appeared inclined to dine and having waited till all was cold on the table i commenced alone nothing hindered me from eating heartily and i experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority as at intervals i cast a look towards my silent companions and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me after i had done i ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire going round seat and kneeling in the corner beside him 
 heathcliff did not glance my way and i gazed up and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone his forehead that i once thought so manly and that i now think so diabolical was shaded with a heavy cloud his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness and weeping perhaps for the lashes were wet then his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness had it been another i would have covered my face in the presence of such grief in his case i was gratified and ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy i miss this chance of sticking in a dart his weakness was the only time when i could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong 
 fie fie miss i interrupted one might suppose you had never opened a bible in your life if god afflict your enemies surely that ought to suffice you it is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his 
 in general allow that it would be ellen she continued but what misery laid on heathcliff could content me unless i have a hand in it rather he suffered less if i might cause his sufferings and he might know that i was the cause o i owe him so much on only one condition can i hope to forgive him it is if i may take an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth for every wrench of agony return a wrench reduce him to my level as he was the first to injure make him the first to implore pardon and then ellen i might show you some generosity but it is utterly impossible i can ever be revenged and therefore i cannot forgive him hindley wanted some water and i handed him a glass and asked him how he was 
 not as ill as i wish he replied but leaving out my arm every inch of me is as sore as if i had been fighting with a legion of imps 
 yes no wonder was my next remark catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her well people really rise from their grave or last night she might have witnessed a repulsive scene are not you bruised and cut over your chest and shoulders 
 i say he answered but what do you mean did he dare to strike me when i was down 
 he trampled on you and kicked you and dashed you on the ground i whispered and his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth because only half a so much 
 mr earnshaw looked up like me to the countenance of our mutual foe who absorbed in his anguish seemed insensible to anything around him the longer he stood the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features 
 oh if god would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony go to hell with joy groaned the impatient man writhing to rise and sinking back in despair convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle 
 nay enough that he has murdered one of you i observed aloud at the grange everyone knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for mr heathcliff after all it is preferable to be hated than loved by him when i recollect how happy we happy catherine was before he fit to curse the day 
 most likely heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said than the spirit of the person who said it his attention was roused i saw for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs i stared full at him and laughed scornfully the clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me the fiend which usually looked out however was so dimmed and drowned that i did not fear to hazard another sound of derision 
 get up and begone out of my sight said the mourner 
 i guessed he uttered those words at least though his voice was hardly intelligible 
 i beg your pardon i replied but i loved catherine too and her brother requires attendance which for her sake i shall supply now that dead i see her in hindley hindley has exactly her eyes if you had not tried to gouge them out and made them black and red and her 
 get up wretched idiot before i stamp you to death he cried making a movement that caused me to make one also 
 but then i continued holding myself ready to flee if poor catherine had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous contemptible degrading title of mrs heathcliff she would soon have presented a similar picture she have borne your abominable behaviour quietly her detestation and disgust must have found voice 
 the back of the settle and person interposed between me and him so instead of endeavouring to reach me he snatched a dinner knife from the table and flung it at my head it struck beneath my ear and stopped the sentence i was uttering but pulling it out i sprang to the door and delivered another which i hope went a little deeper than his missile the last glimpse i caught of him was a furious rush on his part checked by the embrace of his host and both fell locked together on the hearth in my flight through the kitchen i bid joseph speed to his master i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back in the doorway and blest as a soul escaped from purgatory i bounded leaped and flew down the steep road then quitting its windings shot direct across the moor rolling over banks and wading through marshes precipitating myself in fact towards the beacon light of the grange and far rather would i be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than even for one night abide beneath the roof of wuthering heights again 
 isabella ceased speaking and took a drink of tea then she rose and bidding me put on her bonnet and a great shawl i had brought and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour she stepped on to a chair kissed and portraits bestowed a similar salute on me and descended to the carriage accompanied by fanny who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress she was driven away never to revisit the neighbourhood but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled i believe her new abode was in the south near london there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape he was christened linton and from the first she reported him to be an ailing peevish creature 
 mr heathcliff meeting me one day in the village inquired where she lived i refused to tell he remarked that it was not of any moment only she must beware of coming to her brother she should not be with him if he had to keep her himself though i would give no information he discovered through some of the other servants both her place of residence and the existence of the child still he molest her for which forbearance she might thank his aversion i suppose he often asked about the infant when he saw me and on hearing its name smiled grimly and observed 
 they wish me to hate it too do they 
 i think they wish you to know anything about it i answered 
 but have it he said when i want it they may reckon on that 
 fortunately its mother died before the time arrived some thirteen years after the decease of catherine when linton was twelve or a little more 
 on the day succeeding unexpected visit i had no opportunity of speaking to my master he shunned conversation and was fit for discussing nothing when i could get him to listen i saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow so deep and sensitive was his aversion that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of heathcliff grief and that together transformed him into a complete hermit he threw up his office of magistrate ceased even to attend church avoided the village on all occasions and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds only varied by solitary rambles on the moors and visits to the grave of his wife mostly at evening or early morning before other wanderers were abroad but he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long he pray for soul to haunt him time brought resignation and a melancholy sweeter than common joy he recalled her memory with ardent tender love and hopeful aspiring to the better world where he doubted not she was gone 
 and he had earthly consolation and affections also for a few days i said he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed the coldness melted as fast as snow in april and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a sceptre in his heart it was named catherine but he never called it the name in full as he had never called the first catherine short probably because heathcliff had a habit of doing so the little one was always cathy it formed to him a distinction from the mother and yet a connection with her and his attachment sprang from its relation to her far more than from its being his own 
 i used to draw a comparison between him and hindley earnshaw and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances they had both been fond husbands and were both attached to their children and i could not see how they both have taken the same road for good or evil but i thought in my mind hindley with apparently the stronger head has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man when his ship struck the captain abandoned his post and the crew instead of trying to save her rushed into riot and confusion leaving no hope for their luckless vessel linton on the contrary displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul he trusted god and god comforted him one hoped and the other despaired they chose their own lots and were righteously doomed to endure them but not want to hear my moralizing mr lockwood judge as well as i can all these things at least think you will and the same the end of earnshaw was what might have been expected it followed fast on his there was scarcely six months between them we at the grange never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it all that i did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral mr kenneth came to announce the event to my master 
 well nelly said he riding into the yard one morning too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news yours and my turn to go into mourning at present given us the slip now do you think 
 who i asked in a flurry 
 why guess he returned dismounting and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door and nip up the corner of your apron certain need it 
 not mr heathcliff surely i exclaimed 
 what would you have tears for him said the doctor no a tough young fellow he looks blooming today just seen him rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half 
 who is it then mr kenneth i repeated impatiently 
 hindley earnshaw your old friend hindley he replied and my wicked gossip though been too wild for me this long while there i said we should draw water but cheer up he died true to his character drunk as a lord poor lad sorry too one help missing an old companion though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined and has done me many a rascally turn barely it seems your own age who would have thought you were born in one year 
 i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs death ancient associations lingered round my heart i sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation desiring kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master i could not hinder myself from pondering on the he had fair play whatever i did that idea would bother me it was so tiresomely pertinacious that i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights and assist in the last duties to the dead mr linton was extremely reluctant to consent but i pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay and i said my old master and had a claim on my services as strong as his own besides i reminded him that the child hareton was his nephew and in the absence of nearer kin he ought to act as its guardian and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left and look over the concerns of his he was unfit for attending to such matters then but he bid me speak to his lawyer and at length permitted me to go his lawyer had been also i called at the village and asked him to accompany me he shook his head and advised that heathcliff should be let alone affirming if the truth were known hareton would be found little else than a beggar 
 his father died in debt he said the whole property is mortgaged and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the heart that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him 
 when i reached the heights i explained that i had come to see everything carried on decently and joseph who appeared in sufficient distress expressed satisfaction at my presence mr heathcliff said he did not perceive that i was wanted but i might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral if i chose 
 correctly he remarked that body should be buried at the crossroads without ceremony of any kind i happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately we broke in this morning for we heard him snorting like a horse and there he was laid over the settle flaying and scalping would not have wakened him i sent for kenneth and he came but not till the beast had changed into carrion he was both dead and cold and stark and so allow it was useless making more stir about him 
 the old servant confirmed this statement but muttered 
 rayther goan hisseln fur t doctor aw sud uh taen tent uh t maister better nur he deead when aw left nowt uh t soart 
 i insisted on the funeral being respectable mr heathcliff said i might have my own way there too only he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket he maintained a hard careless deportment indicative of neither joy nor sorrow if anything it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed i observed once indeed something like exultation in his aspect it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner and previous to following with hareton he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered with peculiar gusto now my bonny lad you are mine and see if one tree grow as crooked as another with the same wind to twist it the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech he played with whiskers and stroked his cheek but i divined its meaning and observed tartly that boy must go back with me to thrushcross grange sir there is nothing in the world less yours than he is 
 does linton say so he demanded 
 of has ordered me to take him i replied 
 well said the scoundrel not argue the subject now but i have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one so intimate to your master that i must supply the place of this with my own if he attempt to remove it i engage to let hareton go undisputed but be pretty sure to make the other come remember to tell him 
 this hint was enough to bind our hands i repeated its substance on my return and edgar linton little interested at the commencement spoke no more of interfering not aware that he could have done it to any purpose had he been ever so willing 
 the guest was now the master of wuthering heights he held firm possession and proved to the in his turn proved it to mr earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming and he heathcliff was the mortgagee in that manner hareton who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his inveterate enemy and lives in his own house as a servant deprived of the advantage of wages and quite unable to right himself because of his friendlessness and his ignorance that he has been wronged

 chapter seventeen 
 
 for a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood it was really amazing for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind and was all the fashion relieved of their first anxiety about their father girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little and began to fall back into old ways they did not forget their motto but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier and after such tremendous exertions they felt that endeavor deserved a holiday and gave it a good many 
 jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough and was ordered to stay at home till she was better for aunt march like to hear people read with colds in their heads jo liked this and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books amy found that housework and art did not go well together and returned to her mud pies meg went daily to her pupils and sewed or thought she did at home but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother or reading the washington dispatches over and over beth kept on with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving 
 all the little duties were faithfully done each day and many of her sisters also for they were forgetful and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone when her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears for father she went away into a certain closet hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit but everyone felt how sweet and helpful beth was and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs 
 all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise so they did but their mistake was in ceasing to do well and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret 
 meg i wish go and see the hummels you know mother told us not to forget them said beth ten days after mrs departure 
 too tired to go this afternoon meg rocking comfortably as she sewed 
 you jo asked beth 
 too stormy for me with my cold 
 i thought it was almost well 
 well enough for me to go out with laurie but not well enough to go to the hummels said jo laughing but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency 
 why you go yourself asked meg 
 i have been every day but the baby is sick and i know what to do for it mrs hummel goes away to work and lottchen takes care of it but it gets sicker and sicker and i think you or hannah ought to go 
 beth spoke earnestly and meg promised she would go tomorrow 
 ask hannah for some nice little mess and take it round beth the air will do you good said jo adding apologetically go but i want to finish my writing 
 my head aches and tired so i thought maybe some of you would go said beth 
 amy will be in presently and she will run down for us suggested meg 
 so beth lay down on the sofa the others returned to their work and the hummels were forgotten an hour passed amy did not come meg went to her room to try on a new dress jo was absorbed in her story and hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire when beth quietly put on her hood filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes it was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her room half an hour after jo went to closet for something and there found little beth sitting on the medicine chest looking very grave with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand 
 christopher columbus the matter cried jo as beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly had the scarlet fever you 
 years ago when meg did why 
 then tell you oh jo the dead 
 what baby 
 mrs it died in my lap before she got home cried beth with a sob 
 my poor dear how dreadful for you i ought to have gone said jo taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her bit chair with a remorseful face 
 it dreadful jo only so sad i saw in a minute it was sicker but lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor so i took baby and let lotty rest it seemed asleep but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still i tried to warm its feet and lotty gave it some milk but it stir and i knew it was dead 
 cry dear what did you do 
 i just sat and held it softly till mrs hummel came with the doctor he said it was dead and looked at heinrich and minna who have sore throats scarlet fever ought to have called me before he said crossly mrs hummel told him she was poor and had tried to cure baby herself but now it was too late and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay he smiled then and was kinder but it was very sad and i cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or have the fever 
 no you cried jo hugging her close with a frightened look oh beth if you should be sick i never could forgive myself what shall we do 
 be frightened i guess i have it badly i looked in book and saw that it begins with headache sore throat and queer feelings like mine so i did take some belladonna and i feel better said beth laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well 
 if mother was only at home exclaimed jo seizing the book and feeling that washington was an immense way off she read a page looked at beth felt her head peeped into her throat and then said gravely been over the baby every day for more than a week and among the others who are going to have it so afraid you are going to have it beth call hannah she knows all about sickness 
 let amy come she never had it and i should hate to give it to her you and meg have it over again asked beth anxiously 
 i guess not care if i do serve me right selfish pig to let you go and stay writing rubbish myself muttered jo as she went to consult hannah 
 the good soul was wide awake in a minute and took the lead at once assuring that there was no need to worry every one had scarlet fever and if rightly treated nobody died all of which jo believed and felt much relieved as they went up to call meg 
 now tell you what do said hannah when she had examined and questioned beth we will have dr bangs just to take a look at you dear and see that we start right then send amy off to aunt for a spell to keep her out of way and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse beth for a day or two 
 i shall stay of course oldest began meg looking anxious and 
 i shall because my fault she is sick i told mother do the errands and i said jo decidedly 
 which will you have beth there no need of but one aid hannah 
 jo please and beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look which effectually settled that point 
 go and tell amy said meg feeling a little hurt yet rather relieved on the whole for she did not like nursing and jo did 
 amy rebelled outright and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to aunt march meg reasoned pleaded and commanded all in vain amy protested that she would not go and meg left her in despair to ask hannah what should be done before she came back laurie walked into the parlor to find amy sobbing with her head in the sofa cushions she told her story expecting to be consoled but laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room whistling softly as he knit his brows in deep thought presently he sat down beside her and said in his most wheedlesome tone now be a sensible little woman and do as they say no cry but hear what a jolly plan got you go to aunt and come and take you out every day driving or walking and have capital times that be better than moping here 
 i wish to be sent off as if i was in the way began amy in an injured voice 
 bless your heart child to keep you well you want to be sick do you 
 no sure i but i dare say i shall be for been with beth all the time 
 the very reason you ought to go away at once so that you may escape it change of air and care will keep you well i dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly i advise you to be off as soon as you can for scarlet fever is no joke miss 
 but dull at aunt and she is so cross said amy looking rather frightened 
 it be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how beth is and take you out gallivanting the old lady likes me and be as sweet as possible to her so she peck at us whatever we do 
 will you take me out in the trotting wagon with puck 
 on my honor as a gentleman 
 and come every single day 
 see if i 
 and bring me back the minute beth is well 
 the identical minute 
 and go to the theater truly 
 a dozen theaters if we may 
 guess i will said amy slowly 
 good girl call meg and tell her give in said laurie with an approving pat which annoyed amy more than in 
 meg and jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought and amy feeling very precious and promised to go if the doctor said beth was going to be ill 
 how is the little dear asked laurie for beth was his especial pet and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show 
 she is lying down on bed and feels better the death troubled her but i dare say she has only got cold hannah says she thinks so but she looks worried and that makes me fidgety answered meg 
 what a trying world it is said jo rumpling up her hair in a fretful way no sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another there seem to be anything to hold on to when gone so all at sea 
 well make a porcupine of yourself it becoming settle your wig jo and tell me if i shall telegraph to your mother or do anything asked laurie who never had been reconciled to the loss of his one beauty 
 that is what troubles me said meg i think we ought to tell her if beth is really ill but hannah says we for mother leave father and it will only make them anxious beth be sick long and hannah knows just what to do and mother said we were to mind her so i suppose we must but it seem quite right to me 
 hum well i say suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor has been 
 we will jo go and get dr bangs at once commanded meg 
 we decide anything till he has been 
 stay where you are jo errand boy to this establishment said laurie taking up his cap 
 afraid you are busy began meg 
 no done my lessons for the day 
 do you study in vacation time asked jo 
 i follow the good example my neighbors set me was answer as he swung himself out of the room 
 i have great hopes for my boy observed jo watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile 
 he does very well for a boy was somewhat ungracious answer for the subject did not interest her 
 dr bangs came said beth had symptoms of the fever but he thought she would have it lightly though he looked sober over the hummel story amy was ordered off at once and provided with something to ward off danger she departed in great state with jo and laurie as escort 
 aunt march received them with her usual hospitality 
 what do you want now she asked looking sharply over her spectacles while the parrot sitting on the back of her chair called out 
 go away no boys allowed here 
 laurie retired to the window and jo told her story 
 no more than i expected if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks amy can stay and make herself useful if she sick which no doubt she will be looks like it now cry child it worries me to hear people sniff amy was on the point of crying but laurie slyly pulled the tail which caused polly to utter an astonished croak and call out bless my boots in such a funny way that she laughed instead 
 what do you hear from your mother asked the old lady gruffly 
 father is much better replied jo trying to keep sober 
 oh is her well that last long i fancy march never had any stamina was the cheerful reply 
 ha ha never say die take a pinch of snuff goodbye goodbye squalled polly dancing on her perch and clawing at the old cap as laurie tweaked him in the rear 
 hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird and jo better go at once it proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like 
 hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird cried polly tumbling off the chair with a bounce and running to peck the rattlepated boy who was shaking with laughter at the last speech 
 i think i can bear it but try thought amy as she was left alone with aunt march 
 get along you fright screamed polly and at that rude speech amy could not restrain a sniff

lionfish nov chapter seventeen the heir of slytherincontents prev chapter next chapter 
 he was standing at the end of a very long dimly lit chamber towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness casting long black shadows through the odd greenish gloom that filled the place his heart beating very fast harry stood listening to the chill silence could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner behind a pillar and where was ginny 
 
 he pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls he kept his eyes narrowed ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement the hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him more than once with a jolt of the stomach he thought he saw one stir 
 
 then as he drew level with the last pair of pillars a statue high as the chamber itself loomed into view standing against the back wall 
 
 harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above it was ancient and monkeyish with a long thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the sweeping stone robes where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth chamber floor and between the feet facedown lay a small figure with hair 
 
 ginny harry muttered sprinting to her and dropping to his knees ginny be dead please be dead he flung his wand aside grabbed shoulders and turned her over her face was white as marble and as cold yet her eyes were closed so she petrified but then she must be 
 
 ginny please wake up harry muttered desperately shaking her head lolled hopelessly from side to side 
 
 she wake said a soft voice 
 
 harry jumped and spun around on his knees 
 
 a tall boy was leaning against the nearest pillar watching he was strangely blurred around the edges as though harry were looking at him through a misted window but there was no mistaking him 
 
 tom tom riddle 
 
 riddle nodded not taking his eyes off face 
 
 what mean she wake harry said desperately not not 
 
 still alive said riddle but only just 
 
 harry stared at him tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty years ago yet here he stood a weird misty light shining about him not a day older than sixteen 
 
 are you a ghost harry said uncertainly 
 
 a memory said riddle quietly preserved in a diary for fifty years 
 
 he pointed toward the floor near the giant toes lying open there was the little black diary harry had found in moaning bathroom for a second harry wondered how it had got there but there were more pressing matters to deal with 
 
 got to help me tom harry said raising head again got to get her out of here a basilisk i know where it is but it could be along any moment please help me 
 
 riddle move harry sweating managed to hoist ginny half off the floor and bent to pick up his wand again 
 
 but his wand had gone 
 
 did you see 
 
 he looked up riddle was still watching him twirling wand between his long fingers 
 
 thanks said harry stretching out his hand for it 
 
 a smile curled the corners of mouth he continued to stare at harry twirling the wand idly 
 
 listen said harry urgently his knees sagging with dead weight got to go if the basilisk comes 
 
 it come until it is called said riddle calmly 
 
 harry lowered ginny back onto the floor unable to hold her up any longer 
 
 what mean he said look give me my wand i might need it 
 
 smile broadened 
 
 you be needing it he said 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 what mean i be 
 
 waited a long time for this harry potter said riddle for the chance to see you to speak to you 
 
 look said harry losing patience i think you get it in the chamber of secrets we can talk later 
 
 going to talk now said riddle still smiling broadly and he pocketed wand 
 
 harry stared at him there was something very funny going on here 
 
 how did ginny get like this he asked slowly 
 
 well an interesting question said riddle pleasantly and quite a long story i suppose the real reason ginny like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger 
 
 what are you talking about said harry 
 
 the diary said riddle my diary little been writing in it for months and months telling me all her pitiful worries and woes how her brothers tease her how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books how eyes glinted how she think famous good great harry potter would ever like her 
 
 all the time he spoke eyes never left face there was an almost hungry look in them 
 
 very boring having to listen to the silly little troubles of an girl he went on but i was patient i wrote back i was sympathetic i was kind ginny simply loved me no ever understood me like you tom so glad got this diary to confide in like having a friend i can carry around in my pocket 
 
 riddle laughed a high cold laugh that suit him it made the hairs stand up on the back of neck 
 
 if i say it myself harry always been able to charm the people i needed so ginny poured out her soul to me and her soul happened to be exactly what i wanted i grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears her darkest secrets i grew powerful far more powerful than little miss weasley powerful enough to start feeding miss weasley a few of my secrets to start pouring a little of my soul back into her 
 
 what mean said harry whose mouth had gone very dry 
 
 you guessed yet harry potter said riddle softly ginny weasley opened the chamber of secrets she strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls she set the serpent of slytherin on four mudbloods and the cat 
 
 no harry whispered 
 
 yes said riddle calmly of course she know what she was doing at first it was very amusing i wish you could have seen her new diary entries far more interesting they became dear tom he recited watching horrified face i think losing my memory there are rooster feathers all over my robes and know how they got there dear tom l remember what i did on the night of halloween but a cat was attacked and got paint all down my front dear tom percy keeps telling me pale and not myself i think he suspects me there was another attack today and i know where i was tom what am i going to do i think going mad i think the one attacking everyone tom 
 
 fists were clenched the nails digging deep into his palms 
 
 it took a very long time for stupid little ginny to stop trusting her diary said riddle but she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it and where you came in harry you found it and i have been more delighted of all the people who could have picked it up it was you the very person i was most anxious to meet 
 
 and why did you want to meet me said harry anger was coursing through him and it was an effort to keep his voice steady 
 
 well you see ginny told me all about you harry said riddle your whole fascinating history his eyes roved over the lightning scar on forehead and their expression grew hungrier i knew i must find out more about you talk to you meet you if i could so i decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf hagrid to gain your trust 
 
 my friend said harry his voice now shaking and you framed him you i thought you made a mistake but 
 
 riddle laughed his high laugh again 
 
 it was my word against harry well you can imagine how it looked to old armando dippet on the one hand tom riddle poor but brilliant parentless but so brave school prefect model student on the other hand big blundering hagrid in trouble every other week trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed sneaking off to the forbidden forest to wrestle trolls but i admit even i was surprised how well the plan worked i thought someone must realize that hagrid possibly be the heir of slytherin it had taken me five whole years to find out everything i could about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entrance as though hagrid had the brains or the power 
 
 only the transfiguration teacher dumbledore seemed to think hagrid was innocent he persuaded dippetto keep hagrid and train him as gamekeeper yes i think dumbledore might have guessed dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did 
 
 i bet dumbledore saw right through you said harry his teeth gritted 
 
 well he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagrid was expelled said riddle carelessly i knew it be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school but i going to waste those long years spent searching for it i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my self in its pages so that one day with luck i would be able to lead another in my footsteps and finish salazar noble work 
 
 well you finished it said harry triumphantly no died this time not even the cat in a few hours the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again 
 
 i already told you said riddle quietly that killing mudbloods matter to me anymore for many months now my new target has been you 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 imagine how angry i was when the next time my diary was opened it was ginny who was writing to me not you she saw you with the diary you see and panicked what if you found out how to work it and i repeated all her secrets to you what if even worse i told you been strangling roosters so the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back but i knew what i must do it was clear to me that you were on the trail of heir from everything ginny had told me about you i knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery particularly if one of your best friends was attacked and ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak parseltongue 
 
 so i made ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait she struggled and cried and became very boring but there much life left in her she put too much into the diary into me enough to let me leave its pages at last i have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here i knew come i have many questions for you harry potter 
 
 like what harry spat fists still clenched 
 
 well said riddle smiling pleasantly how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord powers were destroyed 
 
 there was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now 
 
 why do you care how i escaped said harry slowly voldemort was after your time 
 
 voldemort said riddle softly is my past present and future harry potter 
 
 he pulled wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air writing three shimmering words 
 
 tom marvolo riddle 
 
 then he waved the wand once and the letters of his name rearranged themselves 
 
 i am lord voldemort 
 
 you see he whispered it was a name i was already using at hogwarts to my most intimate friends only of course you think i was going to use my filthy muggle name forever i in whose veins runs the blood of salazar slytherin himself through my side i keep the name of a foul common muggle who abandoned me even before i was born just because he found out his wife was a witch no harry i fashioned myself a new name a name i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when i had become the greatest sorcerer in the world 
 
 brain seemed to have jammed he stared numbly at riddle at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder own parents and so many others at last he forced himself to speak 
 
 not he said his quiet voice full of hatred 
 
 not what snapped riddle 
 
 not the greatest sorcerer in the world said harry breathing fast sorry to disappoint you and all that but the greatest wizard in the world is albus dumbledore everyone says so even when you were strong you dare try and take over at hogwarts dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now wherever hiding these days 
 
 the smile had gone from face to be replaced by a very ugly look 
 
 been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me he hissed 
 
 not as gone as you might think harry retorted he was speaking at random wanting to scare riddle wishing rather than believing it to be true 
 
 riddle opened his mouth but froze 
 
 music was coming from somewhere riddle whirled around to stare down the empty chamber the music was growing louder it was eerie unearthly it lifted the hair on scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size then as the music reached such a pitch that harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar 
 
 a crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling it had a glittering golden tail as long as a and gleaming golden talons which were gripping a ragged bundle 
 
 a second later the bird was flying straight at harry it dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet then landed heavily on his shoulder as it folded its great wings harry looked up and saw it had a long sharp golden beak and a beady black eye 
 
 the bird stopped singing it sat still and warm next to cheek gazing steadily at riddle 
 
 a phoenix said riddle staring shrewdly back at it 
 
 fawkes harry breathed and he felt the golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently 
 
 and that said riddle now eyeing the ragged thing that fawkes had dropped the old school sorting hat 
 
 so it was patched frayed and dirty the hat lay motionless at feet 
 
 riddle began to laugh again he laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it as though ten riddles were laughing at once 
 
 this is what dumbledore sends his defender a songbird and an old hat do you feel brave harry potter do you feel safe now 
 
 harry answer he might not see what use fawkes or the sorting hat were but he was no longer alone and he waited for riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting 
 
 to business harry said riddle still smiling broadly twice in your past in my future we have met and twice i failed to kill you how did you survive tell me everything the longer you talk he added softly the longer you stay alive 
 
 harry was thinking fast weighing his chances riddle had the wand he harry had fawkes and the sorting hat neither of which would be much good in a duel it looked bad all right but the longer riddle stood there the more life was dwindling out of ginny and in the meantime harry noticed suddenly outline was becoming clearer more solid if it had to be a fight between him and riddle better sooner than later 
 
 no one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me said harry abruptly i know myself but i know why you kill me because my mother died to save me my common mother he added shaking with suppressed rage she stopped you killing me and seen the real you i saw you last year a wreck barely alive where all your power got you in hiding ugly foul 
 
 face contorted then he forced it into an awful smile so your mother died to save you yes a powerful countercharm i can see now there is nothing special about you after all i wondered you see there are strange likenesses between us after all even you must have noticed both orphans raised by muggles probably the only two parselmouths to come to hogwarts since the great slytherin himself we even look something alike but after all it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me all i wanted to know 
 
 harry stood tense waiting for riddle to raise his wand but twisted smile was widening again 
 
 now harry going to teach you a little lesson match the powers of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against famous harry potter and the best weapons dumbledore can give him 
 
 he cast an amused eye over fawkes and the sorting hat then walked away harry fear spreading up his numb legs watched riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of slytherin high above him in the riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed but harry understood what he was saying 
 
 speak to me slytherin greatest of the hogwarts four 
 
 harry wheeled around to look up at the statue fawkes swaying on his shoulder 
 
 gigantic stone face was moving horrorstruck harry saw his mouth opening wider and wider to make a huge black hole 
 
 and something was stirring inside the mouth something was slithering up from its depths 
 
 harry backed away until he hit the dark chamber wall and as he shut his eyes tight he felt sweep his cheek as he took flight harry wanted to shout leave me but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents 
 
 something huge hit the stone floor of the chamber harry felt it shudder he knew what was happening he could sense it could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from mouth then he heard hissing voice 
 
 kill him 
 
 the basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor eyes still tightly shut harry began to run blindly sideways his hands outstretched feeling his way voldemort was laughing 
 
 harry tripped he fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him he could hear it coming 
 
 there was a loud explosive spitting sound right above him and then something heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing something thrashing wildly off the pillars 
 
 he help it he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on 
 
 the enormous serpent bright poisonous green thick as an oak trunk had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars as harry trembled ready to close his eyes if it turned he saw what had distracted the snake 
 
 fawkes was soaring around its head and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers fawkes dived his long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor the tail thrashed narrowly missing harry and before harry could shut his eyes it turned harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes both its great bulbous yellow eyes had been punctured by the phoenix blood was streaming to the floor and the snake was spitting in agony 
 
 no harry heard riddle screaming leave the bird leave the bird the boy is behind you you can still smell him kill him 
 
 the blinded serpent swayed confused still deadly fawkes was circling its head piping his eerie song jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes 
 
 help me help me harry muttered wildly someone anyone 
 
 the tail whipped across the floor again harry ducked something soft hit his face 
 
 the basilisk had swept the sorting hat into arms harry seized it it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the tail swung over him again 
 
 help me help me harry thought his eyes screwed tight under the hat please help me 
 
 there was no answering voice instead the hat contracted as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly 
 
 something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of head almost knocking him out stars winking in front of his eyes he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it 
 
 a gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs 
 
 kill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind you sniff smell him 
 
 harry was on his feet ready the head was falling its body coiling around hitting pillars as it twisted to face him he could see the vast bloody eye sockets see the mouth stretching wide wide enough to swallow him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thin glittering venomous 
 
 it lunged blindly harry dodged and it hit the chamber wall it lunged again and its forked tongue lashed side he raised the sword in both his hands 
 
 the basilisk lunged again and this time its aim was true harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the mouth 
 
 but as warm blood drenched arms he felt a searing pain just above his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell twitching to the floor 
 
 harry slid down the wall he gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm but he knew it was too late pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes his vision went foggy the chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color 
 
 a patch of scarlet swam past and harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him 
 
 fawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes 
 
 he felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the fang had pierced him 
 
 he could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him 
 
 dead harry potter said voice above him dead even bird knows it do you see what doing potter crying 
 
 harry blinked head slid in and out of focus thick pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers 
 
 going to sit here and watch you die harry potter take your time in no hurry 
 
 harry felt drowsy everything around him seemed to be spinning 
 
 so ends the famous harry potter said distant voice alone in the chamber of secrets forsaken by his friends defeated at last by the dark lord he so unwisely challenged be back with your dear mudblood mother soon harry she bought you twelve years of borrowed time but lord voldemort got you in the end as you knew he must 
 
 if this is dying thought harry not so bad 
 
 even the pain was leaving him 
 
 but was this dying instead of going black the chamber seemed to be coming back into focus harry gave his head a little shake and there was fawkes still resting his head on arm a pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound except that there was no wound 
 
 get away bird said voice suddenly get away from him i said get away 
 
 harry raised his head riddle was pointing wand at fawkes there was a bang like a gun and fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet 
 
 phoenix tears said riddle quietly staring at arm of course healing powers i forgot 
 
 he looked into face but it makes no difference in fact i prefer it this way just you and me harry potter you and me 
 
 he raised the wand 
 
 then in a rush of wings fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into lap the diary 
 
 for a split second both harry and riddle wand still raised stared at it then without thinking without considering as though he had meant to do it all along harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book 
 
 there was a long dreadful piercing scream ink spurted out of the diary in torrents streaming over hands flooding the floor riddle was writhing and twisting screaming and flailing and then 
 
 he had gone wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary the basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it 
 
 shaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning as though just traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gathered together his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the mouth 
 
 then came a faint moan from the end of the chamber ginny was stirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk over harry in his robes then to the diary in his hand she drew a great shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face 
 
 harry oh harry i tried to tell you at but i say it in front of percy it was me harry but i i i mean to made me he me over and how did you kill that that thing riddle the last thing i is him coming out of the diary 
 
 all right said harry holding up the diary and showing ginny the fang hole finished look him and the basilisk ginny get out of here 
 
 going to be expelled ginny wept as harry helped her awkwardly to her feet looked forward to coming to hogwarts ever since came and have to leave and mum and dad say 
 
 fawkes was waiting for them hovering in the chamber entrance harry urged ginny forward they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk through the echoing gloom and back into the tunnel harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss 
 
 after a few up the dark tunnel a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached ears 
 
 ron harry yelled speeding up okay got her 
 
 he heard ron give a strangled cheer and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall 
 
 ginny ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first alive i believe it what happened how what where did that bird come from 
 
 fawkes had swooped through the gap after ginny 
 
 said harry squeezing through himself 
 
 how come got a sword said ron gaping at the glittering weapon in hand 
 
 explain when we get out of here said harry with a sideways glance at ginny who was crying harder than ever 
 
 but 
 
 later harry said shortly he think it was a good idea to tell ron yet been opening the chamber not in front of ginny anyway lockhart 
 
 back there said ron still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe in a bad way come and see 
 
 led by fawkes whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe gilderoy lockhart was sitting there humming placidly to himself 
 
 his gone said ron the memory charm backfired hit him instead of us got a clue who he is or where he is or who we are i told him to come and wait here a danger to himself 
 
 lockhart peered up at them all 
 
 hello he said odd sort of place this it do you live here 
 
 no said ron raising his eyebrows at harry 
 
 harry bent down and looked up the long dark pipe 
 
 have you thought how going to get back up this he said to ron 
 
 ron shook his head but fawkes the phoenix had swooped past harry and was now fluttering in front of him his beady eyes bright in the dark he was waving his long golden tail feathers harry looked uncertainly at him 
 
 he looks like he wants you to grab hold said ron looking perplexed but much too heavy for a bird to pull up there 
 
 fawkes said harry an ordinary bird he turned quickly to the others got to hold on to each other ginny grab hand professor lockhart 
 
 he means you said ron sharply to lockhart 
 
 you hold other hand 
 
 harry tucked the sword and the sorting hat into his belt ron took hold of the back of robes and harry reached out and took hold of strangely hot tail feathers 
 
 an extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second in a rush of wings they were flying upward through the pipe harry could hear lockhart dangling below him saying amazing amazing this is just like magic the chill air was whipping through hair and before stopped enjoying the ride it was over all four of them were hitting the wet floor of moaning bathroom and as lockhart straightened his hat the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place 
 
 myrtle goggled at them 
 
 alive she said blankly to harry 
 
 no need to sound so disappointed he said grimly wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses 
 
 oh well just been thinking if you had died have been welcome to share my toilet said myrtle blushing silver 
 
 urgh said ron as they left the bathroom for the dark deserted corridor outside harry i think grown fond of you got competition ginny 
 
 but tears were still flooding silently down face 
 
 where now said ron with an anxious look at ginny harry pointed 
 
 fawkes was leading the way glowing gold along the corridor they strode after him and moments later found themselves outside professor office 
 
 harry knocked and pushed the door open 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen cat rat and dogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mind had gone blank with shock the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the grounds then behind them they heard a wild howling 
 
 hagrid harry muttered without thinking about what he was doing he made to turn back but both ron and hermione seized his arms 
 
 we said ron who was be in worse trouble if they know been to see him 
 
 breathing was shallow and uneven 
 
 how could they she choked how could they 
 
 come on said ron whose teeth seemed to be chattering 
 
 they set off back toward the castle walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak the light was fading fast now 
 
 by the time they reached open ground darkness was settling like a spell around them 
 
 scabbers keep still ron hissed clamping his hand over his chest the rat was wriggling madly ron came to a sudden halt trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket the matter with you you stupid rat stay still ouch he bit me 
 
 ron be quiet hermione whispered urgently be out here in a minute 
 
 he stay put 
 
 scabbers was plainly terrified he was writhing with all his might trying to break free of grip 
 
 the matter with him 
 
 but harry had just seen stinking toward them his body low to the ground wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness crookshanks whether he could see them or was following the sound of squeaks harry tell 
 
 crookshanks hermione moaned no go away crookshanks go away 
 
 but the cat was getting nearer 
 
 scabbers no 
 
 too late the rat had slipped between clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away in one bound crookshanks sprang after him and before harry or hermione could stop him ron had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness 
 
 ron hermione moaned 
 
 she and harry looked at each other then followed at a sprint it was impossible to run full out under the cloak they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanks 
 
 get away from him get away scabbers come here 
 
 there was a loud thud 
 
 gotcha get off you stinking cat 
 
 harry and hermione almost fell over ron they skidded to a stop right in front of him he was sprawled on the ground but scabbers was back in his pocket he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump 
 
 ron come on back under the cloak hermione panted dumbledore the minister be coming back out in a minute 
 
 but before they could cover themselves again before they could even catch their breath they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws something was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow an enormous dog 
 
 harry reached for his wand but too late the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair he felt its hot breath saw teeth 
 
 but the force of its leap had carried it too far it rolled off him dazed feeling as though his ribs were broken harry tried to stand up he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack 
 
 ron was on his feet as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside the jaws fastened instead around outstretched arm harry lunged forward he seized a handful of the hair but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll 
 
 then out of nowhere something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall too 
 
 harry groped for his wand blinking blood out of his eyes 
 
 lumos he whispered 
 
 the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer 
 
 and there at the base of the trunk was the dog dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots ron was fighting furiously but his head and torso were slipping out of sight 
 
 ron harry shouted trying to follow but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again 
 
 all they could see now was one of legs which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot leg had broken and a moment later his foot vanished from sight 
 
 harry got to go for help hermione gasped she was bleeding too the willow had cut her across the shoulder 
 
 no that big enough to eat him we got time 
 
 harry never going to get through without help 
 
 another branch whipped down at them twigs clenched like knuckles 
 
 if that dog can get in we can harry panted darting here and there trying to find a way through the vicious swishing branches but he get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the blows 
 
 oh help help hermione whispered frantically dancing uncertainly on the spot please 
 
 crookshanks darted forward he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk 
 
 abruptly as though the tree had been turned to marble it stopped moving not a leaf twitched or shook 
 
 crookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly she now grasped arm painfully hard how did he know 
 
 friends with that dog said harry grimly seen them together come on and keep your wand out 
 
 they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail harry went next he crawled forward headfirst and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel crookshanks was a little way along his eyes flashing in the light from wand seconds later hermione slithered down beside him 
 
 ron she whispered in a terrified voice 
 
 this way said harry setting off after crookshanks 
 
 where does this tunnel come out hermione asked breathlessly from behind him 
 
 i marked on the map but fred and george said no ever gotten into itit goes off the edge of the map but it looked like it was heading for hogsmeade 
 
 they moved as fast as they could bent almost double ahead of them tail bobbed in and out of view on and on went the passage it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to himhe was drawing breath in sharp painful gasps running at a crouch 
 
 and then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone ahead harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening 
 
 he and hermione paused gasping for breath edging forward both raised their wands to see what lay beyond 
 
 it was a room a very disordered dusty room paper was peeling from the walls there were stains all over the floor every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it the windows were all boarded up 
 
 harry glanced at hermione who looked very frightened but nodded 
 
 harry pulled himself out of the hole staring around the room was deserted but a door to their right stood open leading to a shadowy hallway hermione suddenly grabbed arm again her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows 
 
 harry she whispered i think in the shrieking shack 
 
 harry looked around his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them large chunks had been torn out of it one of the legs had been ripped off entirely 
 
 ghosts do that he said slowly 
 
 at that moment there was a creak overhead something had moved upstairs both of them looked up at the ceiling grip on arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers he raised his eyebrows at her she nodded again and let go 
 
 quietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs 
 
 they reached the dark landing 
 
 nox they whispered together and the lights at the end of their wands went out only one door was open as they crept toward it they heard movement from behind it a low moan and then a deep loud purring they exchanged a last look a last nod 
 
 wand held tightly before him harry kicked the door wide open 
 
 on a magnificent bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks purring loudly at the sight of them on the floor beside him clutching his leg which stuck out at a strange angle was ron 
 
 harry and hermione dashed across to him 
 
 ron are you okay 
 
 the dog 
 
 not a dog ron moaned his teeth were gritted with pain harry a trap 
 
 what 
 
 the an animagus 
 
 ron was staring over shoulder harry wheeled around with a snap the man in the shadows closed the door behind them 
 
 a mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows if eyes been shining out of the deep dark sockets he might have been a corpse the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull his yellow teeth were bared in a grin it was sirius black 
 
 expelliarmus he croaked pointing wand at them 
 
 and wands shot out of their hands high in the air and black caught them then he took a step closer his eyes were fixed on harry 
 
 i thought come and help your friend he said hoarsely 
 
 his voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it your father would have done the same for me brave of you not to run for a teacher gratefulit will make everything much easier 
 
 the taunt about his father rang in ears as though black had bellowed it a boiling hate erupted in chest leaving no place for fear for the first time in his life he wanted his wand back in his hand not to defend himself but to attackto kill without knowing what he was doing he started forward but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back no harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ron however spoke to black 
 
 if you want to kill harry have to kill us too he said fiercely though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color and he swayed slightly as he spoke 
 
 something flickered in shadowed eyes 
 
 lie down he said quietly to ron you will damage that leg even more 
 
 did you hear me ron said weakly though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright have to kill all three of us 
 
 be only one murder here tonight said black and his grin widened 
 
 that harry spat trying to wrench himself free of ron and hermione care last time did you mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at the matter gone soft in azkaban 
 
 harry hermione whimpered be quiet 
 
 he killed my mum and dad harry roared and with a huge effort he broke free of and restraint and lunged forward 
 
 he had forgotten about magic he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen whereas black was a tall man all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he care how much he got hurt in return 
 
 perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid but black raise the wands in time one of hands fastened over his wasted wrist forcing the wand tips away the knuckles of other hand collided with the side of head and they fell backward into the wall 
 
 hermione was screaming ron was yelling there was a blinding flash as the wands in hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed face by inches harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly but he clung on his other hand punching every part of black it could find 
 
 but free hand had found throat 
 
 no he hissed waited too long 
 
 the fingers tightened harry choked his glasses askew 
 
 then he saw foot swing out of nowhere black let go of harry with a grunt of pain ron had thrown himself on wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter 
 
 he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor he threw himself toward it but 
 
 argh 
 
 crookshanks had joined the fray both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into arm harry threw him off but crookshanks now darted toward wand 
 
 no you roared harry and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside spitting harry snatched up his wand and turned 
 
 get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermione 
 
 they need telling twice hermione gasping for breath her lip bleeding scrambled aside snatching up her and wands ron crawled to the and collapsed onto it panting his white face now tinged with green both hands clutching his broken leg 
 
 black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer his wand pointing straight at heart 
 
 going to kill me harry he whispered 
 
 harry stopped right above him his wand still pointing at chest looking down at him a livid bruise was rising around left eye and his nose was bleeding 
 
 you killed my parents said harry his voice shaking slightly but his wand hand quite steady 
 
 black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes 
 
 i deny it he said very quietly but if you knew the whole story 
 
 the whole story harry repeated a furious pounding in his ears you sold them to voldemort all i need to know 
 
 got to listen to me black said and there was a note of urgency in his voice now regret it if you understand 
 
 i understand a lot better than you think said harry and his voice shook more than ever you never heard her did you my mumtrying to stop voldemort killing meand you did thatyou did it 
 
 before either of them could say another word something ginger streaked past harry crookshanks leapt onto chest and settled himself there right over heart black blinked and looked down at the cat 
 
 get off he murmured trying to push crookshanks off him 
 
 but crookshanks sank his claws into robes and shift he turned his ugly squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes to his right hermione gave a dry sob 
 
 harry stared down at black and crookshanks his grip tightening on the wand so what if he had to kill the cat too it was in league with blackif it was prepared to die trying to protect black that business if black wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for parents 
 
 harry raised the wand now was the moment to do it now was the moment to avenge his mother and father he was going to kill black he had to kill black this was his chance 
 
 the seconds lengthened and still harry stood frozen there wand poised black staring up at him crookshanks on his chest ragged breathing came from near the bed hermione was quite silent 
 
 and then came a new sound 
 
 muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor someone was moving downstairs 
 
 up here hermione screamed suddenly up here sirius black quick 
 
 black made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks harry gripped his wand convulsively do it now said a voice in his head but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still done it 
 
 the door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room his face bloodless his wand raised and ready his eyes flickered over ron lying on the floor over hermione cowering next to the door to harry standing there with his wand covering black and then to black himself crumpled and bleeding at feet 
 
 expelliarmus lupin shouted 
 
 wand flew once more out of his hand so did the two hermione was holding lupin caught them all deftly then moved into the room staring at black who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chest 
 
 harry stood there feeling suddenly empty he done it his nerve had failed him black was going to be handed back to the dementors 
 
 then lupin spoke in a very tense voice 
 
 where is he sirius 
 
 harry looked quickly at lupin he understand what lupin meant who was lupin talking about he turned to look at black again 
 
 face was quite expressionless for a few seconds he move at all then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron mystified harry glanced around at ron who looked bewildered 
 
 but then lupin muttered staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind why he shown himself before now unless eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond black something none of the rest could see unless he was the oneunless you switched without telling me 
 
 very slowly his sunken gaze never leaving face black nodded 
 
 professor harry interrupted loudly going on 
 
 but he never finished the question because what he saw made his voice die in his throat lupin was lowering his wand gazing fixed at black the professor walked to side seized his hand pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor and embraced black like a brother 
 
 harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach 
 
 i believe it hermione screamed 
 
 lupin let go of black and turned to her she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin you you 
 
 hermione 
 
 c you and him 
 
 hermione calm down 
 
 i tell anyone hermione shrieked been covering up for you 
 
 hermione listen to me please lupin shouted i can explain 
 
 harry could feel himself shaking not with fear but with a fresh wave of fury 
 
 i trusted you he shouted at lupin his voice wavering out of control and all the time been his friend 
 
 wrong said lupin i been friend but i am now let me explain 
 
 no hermione screamed harry trust him been helping black get into the castle he wants you dead too a werewolf 
 
 there was a ringing silence eyes were now on lupin who looked remarkably calm though rather pale 
 
 not at all up to your usual standard hermione he said only one out of three afraid i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly want harry dead an odd shiver passed over his face but i deny that i am a werewolf 
 
 ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain lupin made toward him looking concerned but ron gasped get away from me werewolf 
 
 lupin stopped dead then with an obvious effort he turned to hermione and said how long have you known 
 
 ages hermione whispered since i did professor essay 
 
 be delighted said lupin coolly he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me 
 
 both hermione said quietly 
 
 lupin forced a laugh 
 
 the cleverest witch of your age ever met hermione 
 
 not hermione whispered if been a bit cleverer have told everyone what you are 
 
 but they already know said lupin at least the staff do 
 
 dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ron gasped is he mad 
 
 some of the staff thought so said lupin he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that trustworthy 
 
 and he was wrong harry yelled been helping him all the time he was pointing at black who suddenly crossed to the bed and sank onto it his face hidden in one shaking hand crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap purring ron edged away from both of them dragging his leg 
 
 i have not been helping sirius said lupin if give me a chance explain look 
 
 he separated and wands and threw each back to its owner harry caught his stunned 
 
 there said lupin sticking his own wand back into his belt armed not now will you listen 
 
 harry know what to think was it a trick 
 
 if you been helping him he said with a furious glance at black how did you know he was here 
 
 the map said lupin the map i was in my office examining it 
 
 you know how to work it harry said suspiciously 
 
 of course i know how to work it said lupin waving his hand impatiently i helped write it moony that was my friends nickname for me at school 
 
 you wrote 
 
 the important thing is i was watching it carefully this evening because i had an idea that you ron and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executed and i was right i 
 
 he had started to pace up and down looking at them little patches of dust rose at his feet 
 
 you might have been wearing your old cloak harry 
 
 how know about the cloak 
 
 the number of times i saw james disappearing under it said lupin waving an impatient hand again the point is even if wearing an invisibility cloak you still show up on the map i watched you cross the grounds and enter hut twenty minutes later you left hagrid and set off back toward the castle but you were now accompanied by somebody else 
 
 what said harry no we 
 
 i believe my eyes said lupin still pacing and ignoring interruption i thought the map must be malfunctioning how could he be with you 
 
 no one was with us said harry 
 
 and then i saw another dot moving fast toward you labeled sirius blacki saw him collide with you i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow 
 
 one of us ron said angrily 
 
 no ron said lupin two of you 
 
 he had stopped his pacing his eyes moving over ron 
 
 do you think i could have a look at the rat he said evenly 
 
 what said ron scabbers got to do with it 
 
 everything said lupin could i see him please 
 
 ron hesitated then put a hand inside his robes scabbers emerged thrashing desperately ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping crookshanks stood up on leg and made a soft hissing noise 
 
 lupin moved closer to ron he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabbers 
 
 what ron said again holding scabbers close to him looking scared my rat got to do with anything 
 
 not a rat croaked sirius black suddenly 
 
 what mean of course a rat 
 
 no not said lupin quietly a wizard 
 
 an animagus said black by the name of peter pettigrew 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban
