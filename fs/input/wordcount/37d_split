lionfish nov chapter the lost prophecycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 feet hit solid ground his knees buckled a little and the golden head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor he looked around and saw that he had arrived in office 
 
 everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmasters absence the delicate silver instruments stood once more on the tables puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture harry looked through the window there was a cool line of pale green along the horizon dawn was approaching 
 
 the silence and the stillness broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait was unbearable to him if his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him the pictures would have been screaming in pain he walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think but he had to think there was no escape 
 
 it was his fault sirius had died it was all his fault if he harry had not been stupid enough to fall for trick if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that voldemort was as hermione had said banking on love of playing the hero 
 
 it was unbearable he would not think about it he could not stand it there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine a dark hole where sirius had been where sirius had vanished he did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it 
 
 a picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said ah harry potter 
 
 phineas nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arms as he surveyed harry out of shrewd narrow eyes 
 
 and what brings you here in the early hours of the morning said phineas eventually this office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster or has dumbledore sent you here oh tell me he gave another shuddering yawn another message for my worthless 
 
 harry could not speak phineas nigellus did not know that sirius was dead but harry could not tell him to say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable 
 
 a few more of the portraits had stirred now terror of being interrogated made harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob 
 
 it would not turn he was shut in 
 
 i hope this means said the corpulent wizard who hung on the wall behind the headmasters desk that dumbledore will soon be back among us 
 
 harry turned the wizard was surveying him with great interest harry nodded he tugged again on the doorknob behind his back but it remained immovable 
 
 oh good said the wizard it has been very dull without him very dull indeed 
 
 he settled himself on the chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon harry 
 
 dumbledore thinks very highly of you as i am sure you know he said comfortably oh yes holds you in great esteem 
 
 the guilt filling the whole of chest like some monstrous weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed harry could not stand this he could not stand being himself any more he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else 
 
 the empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame making harry leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate as tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake many of them giving cries of welcome 
 
 thank you said dumbledore softly 
 
 he did not look at harry at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robes the tiny ugly featherless fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the fawkes usually stood 
 
 well harry said dumbledore finally turning away from the baby bird you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the events 
 
 harry tried to say good but no sound came out it seemed to him that dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused and although dumbledore was for once looking at him directly and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory harry could not bear to meet his eyes 
 
 madam pomfrey is patching everybody up said dumbledore nymphadora tonks may need to spend a little time in st mungos but it seems she will make a full recovery 
 
 harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler he was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word dumbledore spoke wondering where dumbledore and harry had been and why there had been injuries 
 
 i know how feeling harry said dumbledore very quietly 
 
 no you said harry and his voice was suddenly loud and strong anger leapt inside him dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings 
 
 you see dumbledore said phineas nigellus slyly never try to understand the students they hate it they would much rather be tragically misunderstood wallow in stew in their own 
 
 enough phineas said dumbledore 
 
 harry turned his back on dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window he could see the quidditch stadium in the distance sirius had appeared there once disguised as the shaggy black dog so he could watch harry play he had probably come to see whether harry was as good as james had been harry had never asked him 
 
 there is no shame in what you are feeling harry said voice on the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength 
 
 harry felt the anger lick his insides blazing in the terrible emptiness filling him with the desire to hurt dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words 
 
 my greatest strength is it said harry his voice shaking as he stared out at the quidditch stadium no longer seeing it you got a clue you know 
 
 what i know asked dumbledore calmly 
 
 it was too much harry turned around shaking with rage 
 
 i want to talk about how i feel all right 
 
 harry suffering like this proves you are still a man this pain is part of being human 
 
 wanttobehuman harry roared and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the table beside him and flung it across the room it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright and the portrait of armando dippet said really 
 
 i care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace had enough seen enough i want out i want it to end i care any more 
 
 he seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too it broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions 
 
 you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression was calm almost detached you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it 
 
 harry screamed so loudly that he felt his throat might tear and for a second he wanted to rush at dumbledore and break him too shatter that calm old face shake him hurt him make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself 
 
 oh yes you do said dumbledore still more calmly you have now lost your mother your father and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known of course you care 
 
 you know how i feel harry roared youstanding thereyou 
 
 but words were no longer enough smashing things was no more help he wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him that hatefully calm old face he turned on his heel and ran to the door seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it 
 
 but the door would not open 
 
 harry turned back to dumbledore 
 
 let me out he said he was shaking from head to foot 
 
 no said dumbledore simply 
 
 for a few seconds they stared at each other 
 
 let me out harry said again 
 
 no dumbledore repeated 
 
 if you if you keep me in hereif you let me 
 
 by all means continue destroying my possessions said dumbledore serenely i daresay i have too many 
 
 he walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching harry 
 
 let me out harry said yet again in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as 
 
 not until i have had my say said dumbledore 
 
 do youdo you think i want todo you think i give ai care what got to say harry roared i want to hear anything got to say 
 
 you will said dumbledore steadily because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be if you are to attack me as i know you are close to doing i would like to have thoroughly earned it 
 
 what are you talking 
 
 it is my fault that sirius died said dumbledore clearly or should i say almost entirely my faulti will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole sirius was a brave clever and energetic man and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the department of mysteries tonight if i had been open with you harry as i should have been you would have known a long time ago that voldemort might try and lure you to the department of mysteries and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight and sirius would not have had to come after you that blame lies with me and with me alone 
 
 harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it he was gazing at dumbledore hardly breathing listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing 
 
 please sit down said dumbledore it was not an order it was a request 
 
 harry hesitated then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing desk 
 
 am i to understand said phineas nigellus slowly from left that my last of the blacksis dead 
 
 yes phineas said dumbledore 
 
 i believe it said phineas brusquely 
 
 harry turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place he would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for sirius through the house 
 
 harry i owe you an explanation said dumbledore an explanation of an old mistakes for i see now that what i have done and not done with regard to you bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age youth cannot know how age thinks and feels but old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young and i seem to have forgotten lately 
 
 the sun was rising properly now there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright the light fell upon dumbledore upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace 
 
 i guessed fifteen years ago said dumbledore when i saw the scar on your forehead what it might mean i guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and voldemort 
 
 told me this before professor said harry bluntly he did not care about being rude he did not care about anything very much any more 
 
 yes said dumbledore apologetically yes but you seeit is necessary to start with your scar for it became apparent shortly after you rejoined the magical world that i was correct and that your scar was giving you warnings when voldemort was close to you or else feeling powerful emotion 
 
 i know said harry wearily 
 
 and this ability of yoursto detect presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are rousedhas become more and more pronounced since voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers 
 
 harry did not bother to nod he knew all of this already 
 
 more recently said dumbledore i became concerned that voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists sure enough there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence i am speaking of course of the night when you witnessed the attack on mr weasley 
 
 yeah snape told me harry muttered 
 
 professor snape harry dumbledore corrected him quietly but did you not wonder why it was not i who explained this to you why i did not teach you occlumency why i had not so much as looked at you for months 
 
 harry looked up he could see now that dumbledore looked sad and tired 
 
 yeah harry mumbled yeah i wondered 
 
 you see dumbledore continued i believed it could not be long before voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts and i was not eager to give him more incentives to do so i was sure that if he realised that our relationship wasor had ever beencloser than that of headmaster and pupil he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me i feared the uses to which he would put you the possibility that he might try and possess you harry i believe i was right to think that voldemort would have made use of you in such a way on those rare occasions when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes 
 
 harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike in those moments when he and dumbledore had made 
 
 aim in possessing you as he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction it would have been yours he hoped when he possessed you briefly a short while ago that i would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him so you see i have been trying in distancing myself from you to protect you harry an old man s mistake 
 
 he sighed deeply harry was letting the words wash over him he would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of sirius none of it mattered 
 
 sirius told me you felt voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of arthur attack i knew at once that my worst fears were correct voldemort had realised he could use you in an attempt to arm you against assaults on your mind i arranged occlumency lessons with professor snape 
 
 he paused harry watched the sunlight which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of desk illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to explanation he could hear the occasional rustle of robes the slight clearing of a throat phineas nigellus had still not returned 
 
 professor snape discovered dumbledore resumed that you had been dreaming about the door to the department of mysteries for months voldemort of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and as he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant 
 
 and then you saw rookwood who worked in the department of mysteries before his arrest telling voldemort what we had known all alongthat the prophecies held in the ministry of magic are heavily protected only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness in this case either voldemort himself would have to enter the ministry of magic and risk revealing himself at lastor else you would have to take it for him it became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master occlumency 
 
 but i muttered harry he said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart i practise i bother i stopped myself having those dreams hermione kept telling me to do it if i had never have been able to show me where to go andsirius 
 
 something was erupting inside head a need to justify himself to explain 
 
 i tried to check really taken sirius i went to office i spoke to kreacher in the fire and he said sirius there he said gone 
 
 kreacher lied said dumbledore calmly you are not his master he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself kreacher intended you to go to the ministry of magic 
 
 hehe sent me on purpose 
 
 oh yes kreacher i am afraid has been serving more than one master for months 
 
 how said harry blankly he been out of grimmauld place for years 
 
 kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before christmas said dumbledore when sirius apparently shouted at him to get out he took sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house he went to the only black family member for whom he had any respect left cousin narcissa sister of bellatrix and wife of lucius malfoy 
 
 how do you know all this harry said his heart was beating very fast he felt sick he remembered worrying about odd absence over christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic 
 
 kreacher told me last night said dumbledore you see when you gave professor snape that cryptic warning he realised that you had had a vision of sirius trapped in the bowels of the department of mysteries he like you attempted to contact sirius at once i should explain that members of the order of the phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in dolores office professor snape found that sirius was alive and safe in grimmauld place 
 
 when however you did not return from your trip into the forest with dolores umbridge professor snape grew worried that you still believed sirius to be a captive of lord he alerted certain order members at once 
 
 dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued alastor moody nymphadora tonks kingsley shacklebolt and remus lupin were at headquarters when he made contact all agreed to go to your aid at once professor snape requested that sirius remain behind as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened for i was due there at any moment in the meantime he professor snape intended to search the forest for you 
 
 but sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you he delegated to kreacher the task of telling me what had happened and so it was that when i arrived in grimmauld place shortly after they had all left for the ministry it was the elf who told melaughing fit to burstwhere sirius had gone 
 
 he was laughing said harry in a hollow voice 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore you see kreacher was not able to betray us totally he is not secret keeper for the order he could not give the our whereabouts or tell them any of the confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal he was bound by the enchantments of his kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master sirius but he gave narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to voldemort yet must have seemed much too trivial for sirius to think of banning him from repeating it 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like the fact that the person sirius cared most about in the world was you said dumbledore quietly like the fact that you were coming to regard sirius as a mixture of father and brother voldemort knew already of course that sirius was in the order and that you knew where he wasbut information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was sirius black 
 
 lips were cold and numb 
 
 so when i asked kreacher if sirius was there last night 
 
 the undoubtedly on instructionshad told him he must find a way of keeping sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of sirius being tortured then if you decided to check whether sirius was at home or not kreacher would be able to pretend he was not kreacher injured buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire sirius was upstairs tending to him 
 
 there seemed to be very little air in lungs his breathing was quick and shallow 
 
 and kreacher told you all this and laughed he croaked 
 
 he did not wish to tell me said dumbledore but i am a sufficiently accomplished legilimens myself to know when i am being lied to and ipersuaded himto tell me the full story before i left for the department of mysteries 
 
 and whispered harry his hands curled in cold fists on his knees and hermione kept telling us to be nice to him 
 
 she was quite right harry said dumbledore i warned sirius when we adopted twelve grimmauld place as our headquarters that kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect i also told him that kreacher could be dangerous to us i do not think sirius took me very seriously or that he ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a 
 
 you blame youtalkabout sirius like breath was constricted he could not get the words out properly but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again he would not let dumbledore criticise sirius a lyingfoulhe deserved 
 
 kreacher is what he has been made by wizards harry said dumbledore yes he is to be pitied his existence has been as miserable as your friend he was forced to do bidding because sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved but he felt no true loyalty to him and whatever faults it must be admitted that sirius did nothing to make lot easier 
 
 talk about sirius like that harry yelled 
 
 he was on his feet again furious ready to fly at dumbledore who had plainly not understood sirius at all how brave he was how much he had suffered 
 
 what about snape harry spat not talking about him are you when i told him voldemort had sirius he just sneered at me as usual 
 
 harry you know professor snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of dolores umbridge said dumbledore steadily but as i have explained he informed the order as soon as possible about what you had said it was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest it was he too who gave professor umbridge fake veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her whereabouts 
 
 harry disregarded this he felt a savage pleasure in blaming snape it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt and he wanted to hear dumbledore agree with him 
 
 snapesnape g goaded sirius about staying in the househe made out sirius was a coward 
 
 sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him said dumbledore 
 
 snape stopped giving me occlumency lessons harry snarled he threw me out of his office 
 
 i am aware of it said dumbledore heavily i have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself though i was sure at the time that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to voldemort while in my presence 
 
 snape made it worse my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him harry remembered thoughts on the subject and plunged on how do you know he trying to soften me up for voldemort make it easier for him to get inside my 
 
 i trust severus snape said dumbledore simply but i forgotanother old mistake that some wounds run too deep for the healing i thought professor snape could overcome his feelings about your fatheri was wrong 
 
 but ok is it yelled harry ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls ok for snape to hate my dad but not ok for sirius to hate kreacher 
 
 sirius did not hate kreacher said dumbledore he regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie we wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long and we are now reaping our reward 
 
 so sirius deserved what he got did he harry yelled 
 
 i did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it dumbledore replied quietly sirius was not a cruel man he was kind to in general he had no love for kreacher because kreacher was a living reminder of the home sirius had hated 
 
 yeah he did hate it said harry his voice cracking turning his back on dumbledore and walking away the sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked without realising what he was doing without seeing the office at all you made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it why he wanted to get out last night 
 
 i was trying to keep sirius alive said dumbledore quietly 
 
 people like being locked up harry said furiously rounding on him you did it to me all last summer 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands harry watched him but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion or sadness or whatever it was from dumbledore did not soften him on the contrary he felt even angrier that dumbledore was showing signs of weakness he had no business being weak when harry wanted to rage and storm at him 
 
 dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed harry through his glasses 
 
 it is time he said for me to tell you what i should have told you five years ago harry please sit down i am going to tell you everything i ask only a little patience you will have your chance to rage at meto do whatever you like when i have finished i will not stop you 
 
 harry glared at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposite dumbledore and waited 
 
 dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window then looked back at harry and said five years ago you arrived at hogwarts harry safe and whole as i had planned and intended wellnot quite whole you had suffered i knew you would when i left you on your aunt and doorstep i knew i was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years 
 
 he paused harry said nothing 
 
 you might ask and with good reasonwhy it had to be so why could some wizarding family not have taken you in many would have done so more than gladly would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son 
 
 my answer is that my priority was to keep you alive you were in more danger than perhaps anyone but i realised voldemort had been vanquished hours before but his supportersand many of them are almost as terrible as hewere still at large angry desperate and violent and i had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead did i believe that voldemort was gone for ever no i knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty years before he returned but i was sure he would do so and i was sure too knowing him as i have done that he would not rest until he killed you 
 
 i knew that knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive i knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power 
 
 but i knew too where voldemort was weak and so i made my decision you would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows which he despises and which he has always therefore underestimatedto his cost i am speaking of course of the fact that your mother died to save you she gave you a lingering protection he never expected a protection that flows in your veins to this day i put my trust therefore in your blood i delivered you to her sister her only remaining relative 
 
 she love me said harry at once she give a damn 
 
 but she took you dumbledore cut across him she may have taken you grudgingly furiously unwillingly bitterly yet still she took you and in doing so she sealed the charm i placed upon you your sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield i could give you 
 
 i still 
 
 while you can still call home the place where your blood dwells there you cannot be touched or harmed by voldemort he shed her blood but it lives on in you and her sister her blood became your refuge you need return there only once a year but as long as you can still call it home whilst you are there he cannot hurt you your aunt knows this i explained what i had done in the letter i left with you on her doorstep she knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years 
 
 wait said harry wait a moment 
 
 he sat up straighter in his chair staring at dumbledore 
 
 you sent that howler you told her to rememberit was your voice 
 
 i thought said dumbledore inclining his head slightly that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you i suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son 
 
 it did said harry quietly wellmy uncle more than her he wanted to chuck me out but after the howler came sheshe said i had to stay 
 
 he stared at the floor for a moment then said but this got to do with 
 
 he could not say name 
 
 five years ago then continued dumbledore as though he had not paused in his story you arrived at hogwarts neither as happy nor as as i would have liked perhaps yet alive and healthy you were not a pampered little prince but as normal a boy as i could have hoped under the circumstances thus far my plan was working well 
 
 and then well you will remember the events of your first year at hogwarts quite as clearly as i do you rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and soonermuch soonerthan i had anticipated you found yourself face to face with voldemort you survived again you did more you delayed his return to full power and strength you fought a fight i was prouder of you than i can say 
 
 yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine said dumbledore an obvious flaw that i knew even then might be the undoing of it all and yet knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed i told myself that i would not permit this flaw to ruin it i alone could prevent this so i alone must be strong and here was my first test as you lay in the hospital wing weak from your struggle with voldemort 
 
 i understand what saying said harry 
 
 you remember asking me as you lay in the hospital wing why voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 ought i to have told you then 
 
 harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing but his heart was racing again 
 
 you do not see the flaw in the plan yet no perhaps not well as you know i decided not to answer you eleven i told myself was much too young to know i had never intended to tell you when you were eleven the knowledge would be too much at such a young age 
 
 i should have recognised the danger signs then i should have asked myself why i did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which i knew one day i must give a terrible answer i should have recognised that i was too happy to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young 
 
 and so we entered your second year at hogwarts and once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams you did not ask me again however why voldemort had left that mark on you we discussed your scar oh yes we came very very close to the subject why did i not tell you everything 
 
 well it seemed to me that twelve was after all hardly better than eleven to receive such information i allowed you to leave my presence bloodstained exhausted but exhilarated and if i felt a twinge of unease that i ought perhaps to have told you then it was swiftly silenced you were still so young you see and i could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph 
 
 do you see harry do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid 
 
 i 
 
 i cared about you too much said dumbledore simply i cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed in other words i acted exactly as voldemort expects we fools who love to act 
 
 is there a defence i defy anyone who has watched you as i haveand i have watched you more closely than you can have imaginednot to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered what did i care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy i never dreamed that i would have such a person on my hands 
 
 we entered your third year i watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors as you found sirius learned what he was and rescued him was i to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the ministry but now at the age of thirteen my excuses were running out young you might be but you had proved you were exceptional my conscience was uneasy harry i knew the time must come soon 
 
 but you came out of the maze last year having watched cedric diggory die having escaped death so narrowly yourself and i did not tell you though i knew now voldemort had returned i must do it soon and now tonight i know you have long been ready for the knowledge i have kept from you for so long because you have proved that i should have placed the burden upon you before this my only defence is this i have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and i could not bring myself to add anotherthe greatest one of all 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak 
 
 i still understand 
 
 voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth he knew the prophecy had been made though he did not know its full contents he set out to kill you when you were still a baby believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy he discovered to his cost that he was mistaken when the curse intended to kill you backfired and so since his return to his body and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety this is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return the knowledge of how to destroy you 
 
 the sun had risen fully now office was bathed in it the glass case in which the sword of godric gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque the fragments of the instruments harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops and behind him the baby fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes 
 
 the smashed harry said blankly i was pulling neville up those benches in the the room where the archway was and i ripped his robes and it fell 
 
 the thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the department of mysteries but the prophecy was made to somebody and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly 
 
 who heard it asked harry though he thought he knew the answer already 
 
 i did said dumbledore on a cold wet night sixteen years ago in a room above the bar at the head inn i had gone there to see an applicant for the post of divination teacher though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of divination to continue at all the applicant however was the of a very famous very gifted seer and i thought it common politeness to meet her i was disappointed it seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself i told her courteously i hope that i did not think she would be suitable for the post i turned to leave 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked past harry to the black cabinet that stood beside perch he bent down slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin carved with runes around the edges in which harry had seen his father tormenting snape dumbledore walked back to the desk placed the pensieve upon it and raised his wand to his own temple from it he withdrew silvery strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin he sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the pensieve for a moment then with a sigh he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip 
 
 a figure rose out of it draped in shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses and she revolved slowly her feet in the basin but when sybill trelawney spoke it was not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tones harry had heard her use once before 
 
 the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies 
 
 the slowly revolving professor trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished 
 
 the silence within the office was absolute neither dumbledore nor harry nor any of the portraits made a sound even fawkes had fallen silent 
 
 professor dumbledore harry said very quietly for dumbledore still staring at the pensieve seemed completely lost in thought it did that mean what did that mean 
 
 it meant said dumbledore that the person who has the only chance of conquering lord voldemort for good was born at the end of july nearly sixteen years ago this boy would be born to parents who had already defied voldemort three times 
 
 harry felt as though something was closing in on him his breathing seemed difficult again 
 
 it meansme 
 
 dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses 
 
 the odd thing harry he said softly is that it may not have meant you at all prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys both born at the end of july that year both of whom had parents in the order of the phoenix both sets of parents having narrowly escaped voldemort three times one of course was you the other was neville longbottom 
 
 but then but then why was it my name on the prophecy and not 
 
 the official record was after attack on you as a child said dumbledore it seemed plain to the keeper of the hall of prophecy that voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom sybill was referring 
 
 thenit might not be me said harry 
 
 i am afraid said dumbledore slowly looking as though every word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you 
 
 but you said neville was born at the end of july tooand his mum and dad 
 
 you are forgetting the next part of the prophecy the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish voldemort voldemort himself would mark him as his so he did harry he chose you not neville he gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse 
 
 but he might have chosen wrong said harry he might have marked the wrong person 
 
 he chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said dumbledore and notice this harry he chose not the which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the like himself he saw himself in you before he had ever seen you and in marking you with that scar he did not kill you as he intended but gave you powers and a future which have fitted you to escape him not once but four times so far something that neither your parents nor parents ever achieved 
 
 why did he do it then said harry who felt numb and cold why did he try and kill me as a baby he should have waited to see whether neville or i looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then 
 
 that might indeed have been the more practical course said dumbledore except that information about the prophecy was incomplete the head inn which sybill chose for its cheapness has long attracted shall we say a more interesting clientele than the three broomsticks as you and your friends found out to your cost and i to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard of course i had not dreamed when i set out to meet sybill trelawney that i would hear anything worth overhearing myourone stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building 
 
 so he only heard 
 
 he heard only the beginning the part foretelling the birth of a boy in july to parents who had thrice defied voldemort consequently he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you and marking you as his equal so voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you that it might be wise to wait to learn more he did not know that you would have power the dark lord knows not 
 
 but i said harry in a strangled voice i any powers he got i fight the way he did tonight i possess people oror kill them 
 
 there is a room in the department of mysteries interrupted dumbledore that is kept locked at all times it contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than the forces of nature it is also perhaps the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there it is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which voldemort has not at all that power took you to save sirius tonight that power also saved you from possession by voldemort because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests in the end it mattered not that you could not close your mind it was your heart that saved you 
 
 harry closed his eyes if he had not gone to save sirius sirius would not have died more to stave off the moment when he would have to think of sirius again harry asked without caring much about the answer the end of the prophecy it was something about neither can live 
 
 while the other survives said dumbledore 
 
 so said harry dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him so does that mean that that one of us has got to kill the other one in the end 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 for a long time neither of them spoke somewhere far beyond the office walls harry could hear the sound of voices students heading down to the great hall for an early breakfast perhaps it seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food who laughed who neither knew nor cared that sirius black was gone for ever sirius seemed a million miles away already even now a part of harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil he would have found sirius looking back at him greeting him perhaps with his laugh like a bark 
 
 i feel i owe you another explanation harry said dumbledore hesitantly you may perhaps have wondered why i never chose you as a prefect i must confess that i rather thought you had enough responsibility to be going on with 
 
 harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down face into his long silver beard 
 
 rowling
