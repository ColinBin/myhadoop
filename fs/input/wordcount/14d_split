lionfish nov chapter fourteen percy and padfootcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning he lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his hangings and savoured the thought that it was saturday the first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever like one gigantic history of magic lesson 
 
 judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight it was just after daybreak he pulled open the curtains around his bed got up and started to dress the only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow deep breathing of his fellow gryffindors he opened his schoolbag carefully pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room 
 
 making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room the detritus of bits of parchment old gobstones empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone as were all elf hats wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not harry uncorked his ink bottle dipped his quill into it then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment thinking hard but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate at a complete loss for what to say 
 
 he could now appreciate how hard it had been for ron and hermione to write him letters over the summer how was he supposed to tell sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential a lot of information he did not want them to have 
 
 he sat quite motionless for a while gazing into the fireplace then finally coming to a decision he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment 
 
 dear snuffles 
 
 hope ok the first week back been terrible really glad the weekend 
 
 got a new defence against the dark arts teacher professor umbridge nearly as nice as your mum writing because that thing i wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when i was doing a detention with umbridge 
 
 all missing our biggest friend we hope be back soon 
 
 please write back quickly 
 
 best 
 
 harry 
 
 harry reread the letter several times trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider he could not see how they would know what he was talking aboutor who he was talking tojust from reading this letter he did hope sirius would pick up the hint about hagrid and tell them when he might be back harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what hagrid might be up to while he was not at hogwarts 
 
 considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above sealing the parchment carefully he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the owlery 
 
 i would not go that way if i were you said nearly headless nick drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of harry as he walked down the passage peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of paracelsus halfway down the corridor 
 
 does it involve paracelsus falling on top of the head asked harry 
 
 funnily enough it does said nearly headless nick in a bored voice subtlety has never been strong point off to try and find the bloody baron he might be able to put a stop to it see you harry 
 
 yeah bye said harry and instead of turning right he turned left taking a longer but safer route up to the owlery his spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky he had training later he would be back on the quidditch pitch at last 
 
 something brushed his ankles he looked down and saw the skeletal grey cat mrs norris slinking past him she turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of wilfred the wistful 
 
 not doing anything wrong harry called after her she had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss yet harry could not see why he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the owlery on a saturday morning 
 
 the sun was high in the sky now and when harry entered the owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters a little restless in the light some clearly just returned from hunting the floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones craning his neck for a sight of hedwig 
 
 there you are he said spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling get down here got a letter for you 
 
 with a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder 
 
 right i know this says snuffles on the outside he told her giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and without knowing exactly why whispering but for sirius ok 
 
 she blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood 
 
 safe flight then said harry and he carried her to one of the windows with a moments pressure on his arm hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky he watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished then switched his gaze to hut clearly visible from this window and just as clearly uninhabited the chimney smokeless the curtains drawn 
 
 the treetops of the forbidden forest swayed in a light breeze harry watched them savouring the fresh air on his face thinking about quidditch later then he saw it a great reptilian winged hcrse just like the ones pulling the hogwarts carriages with leahery black wings spread wide like a rose up out of the trees like a grotesque giant bird it soared in a great circle then plunged back into the trees the whole thing had happened so quickly harry could hardly believe what he had seen except that his heart was hammering madly 
 
 the owlery door opened behind him he leapt in shock and turning quickly saw cho chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands 
 
 hi said harry automatically 
 
 oh hi she said breathlessly i think anyone would be up here this early i only remembered five minutes ago my birthday 
 
 she held up the parcel 
 
 right said harry his brain seemed to have jammed he wanted to say something funny and interesting but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind 
 
 nice day he said gesturing to the windows his insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment the weather he was talking about the weather 
 
 yeah said cho looking around for a suitable owl good quidditch conditions i been out all week have you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 cho had selected one of the school barn owls she coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel 
 
 hey has gryffindor got a new keeper yet she asked 
 
 yeah said harry my friend ron weasley know him 
 
 the said cho rather coolly is he any good 
 
 yeah said harry i think so i see his tryout though i was in detention 
 
 cho looked up the parcel only to the legs 
 
 that umbridge foul she said in a low voice putting you in detention just because you told the truth about howhowhow he died everyone heard about it it was all over the school you were really brave standing up to her like that 
 
 insides so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the floor who cared about a stupid flying horse cho thought he had been really brave for a moment he considered showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred the owlery door opened again 
 
 filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room there were purple patches on his sunken veined cheeks his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled he had obviously run here mrs norris came trotting at his heels gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily there was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion 
 
 aha said filch taking a step towards harry his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger had a that you are intending to place a massive order for dungbombs 
 
 harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker 
 
 who told you i was ordering dungbombs 
 
 cho was looking from harry to filch also frowning the barn owl on her arm tired of standing on one leg gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it 
 
 i have my sources said filch in a hiss now hand over whatever it is sending 
 
 feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter harry said i gone 
 
 gone said filch his face contorting with rage 
 
 gone said harry calmly 
 
 filch opened his mouth furiously mouthed for a few seconds then raked robes with his eyes 
 
 how do i know you got it in your pocket 
 
 because 
 
 i saw him send it said cho angrily 
 
 filch rounded on her 
 
 you saw him 
 
 right i saw him she said fiercely 
 
 there was a pause in which filch glared at cho and cho glared right back then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door he stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at harry 
 
 if i get so much as a whiff of a dungbomb 
 
 he stumped off down the stairs mrs norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him 
 
 harry and cho looked at each other 
 
 thanks harry said 
 
 no problem said cho finally fixing the parcel to the barn other leg her face slightly pink you ordering dungbombs were you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 i wonder why he thought you were then she said as she carried the owl to the window 
 
 harry shrugged he was quite as mystified by that as she was though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment 
 
 they left the owlery together at the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle cho said going this see you around harry 
 
 yeah see you 
 
 she smiled at him and departed harry walked on feeling quietly elated he had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once you were really brave standing up to her like that cho had called him brave she did not hate him for being alive 
 
 of course she had preferred cedric he knew that though if only asked her to the ball before cedric had things might have turned out differently she had seemed sincerely sorry that had to refuse when harry asked her 
 
 morning harry said brightly to ron and hermione as he joined them at the gryffindor table in the great hall 
 
 what are you looking so pleased about said ron eyeing harry in surprise 
 
 erm quidditch later said harry happily pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him 
 
 oh yeah said ron he put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice then he said listen you fancy going out a bit earlier with me do you just toergive me some practice before training so i can you know get my eye in a bit 
 
 yeah ok said harry 
 
 look i think you should said hermione seriously both really behind on homework as it 
 
 but she broke off the morning post was arriving and as usual the daily prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg hermione pushed a knut into its leather pouch took the newspaper and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off 
 
 anything interesting said ron harry grinned knowing ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework 
 
 no she sighed just some guff about the bass player in the weird sisters getting married 
 
 hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon ron was staring up at the high windows looking slightly preoccupied 
 
 wait a moment said hermione suddenly oh no sirius 
 
 happened said harry snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle with him and hermione each holding one half 
 
 the ministry of magic has received a from a reliable source that sirius black notorious mass murderer blah blah blah is currently hiding in read from her half in an anguished whisper 
 
 lucius malfoy bet anything said harry in a low furious voice he did recognise sirius on the platform 
 
 what said ron looking alarmed you say 
 
 shh said the other two 
 
 ministry warns wizarding community that black is very dangerous killed thirteen people broke out of azkaban the usual rubbish hermione concluded laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at harry and ron well he just be able to leave the house again all she whispered dumbledore did warn him not to 
 
 harry looked down glumly at the bit of the prophet he had torn off most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for madam robes for all occasions which was apparently having a sale 
 
 hey he said flattening it down so hermione and ron could see it look at this 
 
 got all the robes i want said ron 
 
 no said harry look this little piece here 
 
 ron and hermione bent closer to read it the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column it was headlined 
 
 trespass at ministry 
 
 
 
 sturgis podmore of number two laburnum gardens clapham has appeared in front of the wizcngamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the ministry of magic on st august podmore was arrested by ministry of magic watchwizard eric munch who found him attempting to force his way through a door at one in the morning podmore who refused to speak in his own defence was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in azkaban 
 
 
 
 sturgis podmore said ron slowly that bloke who looks like his been thatched he one of the ord 
 
 ron shh said hermione casting a terrified look around them 
 
 six months in azkaban whispered harry shocked just for trying to get through a door 
 
 be silly it just for trying to get through a door what on earth was he doing at the ministry of magic at one in the morning breathed hermione 
 
 reckon he was doing something for the order ron muttered 
 
 wait a moment said harry slowly sturgis was supposed to come and see us off remember 
 
 the other two looked at him 
 
 yeah he was supposed to be part of our guard going to cross remember and moody was all annoyed because he turn up so he have been on a job for them could he 
 
 well maybe they expect him to get caught said hermione 
 
 it could be a ron exclaimed excitedly nolisten he went on dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on face the ministry suspects one of lot soi dunnothey lured him to the ministry and he trying to get through a door at all maybe just made something up to get him 
 
 there was a pause while harry and hermione considered this harry thought it seemed hermione on the other hand looked rather impressed 
 
 do you know i be at all surprised if that were true 
 
 she folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully as harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie 
 
 right well i think we should tackle that essay for sprout on shrubs first and if lucky be able to start inanimatus conjurus spell before lunch 
 
 harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs but the sky was a clear exhilarating blue and he had not been on his firebolt for a week 
 
 i mean we can do it tonight said ron as he and harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the quidditch pitch their broomsticks over their shoulders and with dire warnings that they would fail all their owls still ringing in their ears and got tomorrow she gets too worked up about work her trouble there was a pause and he added in a slightly more anxious tone think she meant it when she said we copying from her 
 
 yeah i do said harry still this is important too got to practise if we want to stay on the quidditch team 
 
 yeah right said ron in a heartened tone and we have got plenty of time to do it all 
 
 as they approached the quidditch pitch harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the forbidden forest were swaying darkly nothing flew out of them the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the owlery tower he had enough to worry about the flying horse doing him any harm he pushed it out of his mind 
 
 they collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work ron guarding the three tall goalposts harry playing chaser and trying to get the quaffle past ron harry thought ron was pretty good he blocked of the goals harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practised after a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunchduring which hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsiblethen returned to the quidditch pitch for the real training session all their teammates but angelina were already in the changing room when they entered 
 
 all right ron said george winking at him 
 
 yeah said ron who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch 
 
 ready to show us all up ickle prefect said fred emerging from the neck of his quidditch robes a slightly malicious grin on his face 
 
 shut up said ron pulling on his own team robes for the first time they fitted him well considering they had been oliver who was rather broader in the shoulder 
 
 ok everyone said angelina entering from the office already changed get to it alicia and fred if you can just bring out the ball crate for us oh and there are a couple of people out there watching but i want you to just ignore them all right 
 
 something in her casual voice made harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were and sure enough when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the slytherin quidditch team and assorted who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium 
 
 that riding malfoy called in his sneering drawl why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that 
 
 crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and harry followed him watching his ears turn red from behind 
 
 ignore them he said accelerating to catch up with ron see laughing after we play them 
 
 exactly the attitude i want harry said angelina approvingly soaring around them with the quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team ok everyone going to start with some passes just to warm up the whole team please 
 
 hey johnson with that hairstyle anyway shrieked pansy parkinson from below why would anyone want to look like got worms coming out of their head 
 
 angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly spread out then and see what we can do 
 
 harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch ron fell back towards the opposite goal angelina raised the quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to fred who passed to george who passed to harry who passed to ron who dropped it 
 
 the slytherins led by malfoy roared and screamed with laughter ron who had pelted towards the ground to catch the quaffle before it landed pulled out of the dive untidily so that he slipped sideways on his broom and returned to playing height blushing harry saw fred and george exchange looks but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything for which he was grateful 
 
 pass it on ron called angelina as though nothing had happened 
 
 ron threw the quaffle to alicia who passed back to harry who passed to george 
 
 hey potter your scar feeling called malfoy sure you need a lie down it must be what a whole week since you were in the hospital wing a record for you it 
 
 george passed to angelina she to harry who had not been expecting it but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to ron who lunged for it and missed by inches 
 
 come on now ron said angelina crossly as he dived for the ground again chasing the quaffle pay attention 
 
 it would have been hard to say whether face or the quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team were howling with laughter 
 
 on his third attempt ron caught the quaffle perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight though outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face 
 
 sorry ron groaned zooming forwards to see whether he had done any damage 
 
 get back in position fine barked angelina but as passing to a teammate do try not to knock her off her broom you got bludgers for that 
 
 nose was bleeding down below the slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering fred and george converged on katie 
 
 here take this fred told her handing her something small anc purple from out of his pocket clear it up in no time 
 
 all right called angelina fred george go and get your bats and a bludger ron get up to the goalposts harry release the snitch when i say so going to aim for goal obviously 
 
 harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the snitch 
 
 making a right ear of things he muttered george as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the bludgers and the snitch 
 
 just nervous said harry he was fine when i was practising with him this morning 
 
 yeah well i hope he peaked too soon said fred gloomily 
 
 they returned to the air when angelina blew her whistle harry released the snitch and fred and george let fly the bludger from that moment on harry was barely aware of what the others were doing it was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the team and doing so required enormous speed and skill he accelerated rolling and swerving in and out of the chasers the warm autumn air whipping his face and the distant yells of the slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears but too soon the whistle brought him to a halt again 
 
 stopstop stop screamed angelina not covering your middle post 
 
 harry looked round at ron who was hovering in front of the hoop leaving the other two completely unprotected 
 
 oh sorry 
 
 you keep shifting around while watching the chasers said angelina either stay in centre position until you have to move to defend a hoop or else circle the hoops but drift vaguely off to one side how you let in the last three goals 
 
 sorry ron repeated his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky 
 
 and katie you do something about that nosebleed 
 
 just getting worse said katie thickly attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve 
 
 harry glanced round at fred who was looking anxious and checking his pockets he saw fred pull out something purple examine it for a second and then look round at katie evidently 
 
 well try again said angelina she was ignoring the slytherins who had now set up a chant of gryffindor are losers gryffindor are losers but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless 
 
 this time they had been flying for barely three minutes when angelinas whistle sounded harry who had just sighted the snitch circling the opposite goalpost pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved 
 
 what now he said impatiently to alicia who was nearest 
 
 katie she said shortly 
 
 harry turned and saw angelina fred and george all flying as fast as they could towards katie harry and alicia sped towards her too it was plain that angelina had stopped training just in time katie was now chalk white and covered in blood 
 
 she needs the hospital wing said angelina 
 
 take her said fred sheermight have swallowed a blood blisterpod by mistake 
 
 well no point continuing with no beaters and a chaser gone said angelina glumly as fred and george zoomed off towards the castle supporting katie between them come on go and get changed 
 
 the slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms 
 
 how was practice asked hermione rather coolly half an hour later as harry and ron climbed through the portrait hole into the gryffindor common room 
 
 it was harry began 
 
 completely lousy said ron in a hollow voice sinking into a chair beside hermione she looked up at ron and her frost mess seemed to melt 
 
 well it was only your first one she said consolingly bound to take time to 
 
 who said it was me who made it lousy snapped ron 
 
 no one said hermione looking taken aback i thought 
 
 you thought i was bound to be rubbish 
 
 no of course i look you said it was lousy so i just 
 
 going to get started on some homework said ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys dormitories and vanished from sight hermione turned to harry 
 
 was he lousy 
 
 no said harry loyally 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 well i suppose he played better harry muttered but it was only the first training session like you said 
 
 neither harry nor ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night harry knew ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the gryffindor are losers chant out of his head 
 
 they spent the whole of sunday in the common room buried in heir books while the room around them filled up then emptied it was another clear fine day and most of their fellow gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year by the evening harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull 
 
 you know we probably should try and get more homework done during the week harry muttered to ron as they finally laid aside professor long essay on the inanimatus conjurus spell and turned miserably to professor equally long and difficult essay about many moons 
 
 yeah said ron rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them listen shall we just ask hermione if we can have a look at what done 
 
 harry glanced over at her she was sitting with crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks 
 
 no he said heavily you know she let us 
 
 and so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker slowly the crowd in the common room began to thin again at half past eleven hermione wandered over to them yawning 
 
 nearly done 
 
 no said ron shortly 
 
 biggest moon is ganymede not callisto she said pointing over shoulder at a line in his astronomy essay and io got the volcanoes 
 
 thanks snarled ron scratching out the offending sentences 
 
 sorry i only 
 
 yeah well if just come over here to criticise 
 
 ron 
 
 i got time to listen to a sermon all right hermione up to my neck in it here 
 
 nolook 
 
 hermione was pointing to the nearest window harry and ron both looked over a handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill gazing into the room at ron 
 
 that hermes said hermione sounding amazed 
 
 blimey it is said ron quietly throwing down his quill and getting to his feet percy writing to me for 
 
 he crossed to the window and opened it hermes flew inside landed on essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once leaving inky footprints across drawing of the moon io 
 
 definitely handwriting said ron sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll ronald weasley gryffindor house hogwarts he looked up at the other two what reckon 
 
 open it said hermione eagerly and harry nodded 
 
 ron unrolled the scroll and began to read the further clown the parchment his eyes travelled the more pronounced became his scowl when he had finished reading he looked disgusted he thrust the letter at harry and hermione who leaned towards each other to read it together 
 
 dear ron 
 
 i have only just heard from no less a person than the minister for magic himself who has it from your new teacher professor umbridge that you have become a hogwarts prefect 
 
 i was most pleasantly surprised when f heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations i must admit that i have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the fred and george route rather than following in my footsteps so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility 
 
 but i want to give you more than congratulations ron i want to give you some advice which is why i am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions 
 
 from something the minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect i gather that you are still seeing a lot of harry potter i must tell you ron that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy yes i am sure you are surprised to hear this no doubt you will say that potter has always been favouritebut i feel bound to tell you that dumbledore may not be in charge at hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very differentand probably more accurateview of behaviour i shall say no more here but if you look at the daily prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowingand see if you can spot yours truly 
 
 seriously ron you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as potter it could be very damaging to your future prospects and i am talking here about life after school too as you must be aware given that our father escorted him to court potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good he got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people spoken to remain convinced of his guilt 
 
 it may be that you are afraid to sever ties with potteri know that he can be unbalanced and for all i know violentbut if you have any worries about this or have spotted anything else in behaviour that is troubling you i urge you to speak to dolores umbridge a truly delightful woman who i know will be only too happy to advise you 
 
 this leads me to my other bit of advice as i have hinted above regime at hogwarts may soon be over your loyalty ron should be not to him but to the school and the ministry i am very sorry to hear that so far professor umbridge is encountering very little from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within hogwarts that the ministry so ardently desires although she should find this easier from next week again see the daily prophet tomorrow i shall say only thisa student who shows himself willing to help professor umbridge now may be very for head boyship in a couple of years 
 
 i am sorry that i was unable to see more of you over the summer it pains me to criticise our parents but i am afraid i can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around dumbledore if you are writing to mother at any point you might tell her that a certain sturgis podmore who is a great friend of has recently been sent to azkaban for trespass at the ministry perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders i count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such peoplethe minister really could not be more gracious to meand i do hope ron that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents beliefs and actions either i sincerely hope that in time they will realise how mistaken they were and i shall of course be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes 
 
 please think over what i have said most carefully particularly the bit about harry potter and congratulations again on becoming prefect 
 
 your brother 
 
 percy 
 
 harry looked up at ron 
 
 well he said trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke if you want toer what is checked ties with me i swear i get violent 
 
 give it back said ron holding out his hand he is ron said jerkily tearing letter in half the he tore it into quarters biggest he tore it into eighths git he threw the pieces into the fire 
 
 come on got to get this finished sometime before dawn he said briskly to harry pulling professor essay back towards him 
 
 hermione was looking at ron with an odd expression on her face 
 
 oh give them here she said abruptly 
 
 what said ron 
 
 give them to me look through them and correct them she said 
 
 are you serious ah hermione a said ron what can i 
 
 what you can say is we promise never leave our homework this late again she said holding out both hands for their essays but she looked slightly amused all the same 
 
 thanks a million hermione said harry weakly passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair rubbing his eyes 
 
 it was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and crookshanks the only sound was that of quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table harry was exhausted he also felt an odd sick empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire 
 
 he knew that half the people inside hogwarts thought him strange even mad he knew that the daily prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months but there was something about seeing it written down like that in writing about knowing that percy was advising ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to umbridge that made his situation real to him as nothing else had he had known percy for four years had stayed in his house during the summer holidays shared a tent with him during the quidditch world cup had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the triwizard tournament last year yet now percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent 
 
 and with a surge of sympathy for his godfather harry thought sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment because sirius was in the same situation nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought sirius a dangerous murderer and a great voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years 
 
 harry blinked he had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there it had flashed into sight and vanished immediately no it could not have been he had imagined it because he had been thinking about sirius 
 
 ok write that down hermione said to ron pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to ron then add this conclusion written for you 
 
 hermione you are honestly the most wonderful person ever met said ron weakly and if ever rude to you again 
 
 know back to normal said hermione harry yours is ok except for this bit at the end i think you must have misheard professor sinistra covered in ice not miceharry 
 
 harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug gazing into the flames 
 
 erharry said ron uncertainly why are you down there 
 
 because just seen head in the fire said harry 
 
 he spoke quite calmly after all he had seen head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too nevertheless he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time it had vanished so quickly 
 
 head hermione repeated you mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the triwizard tournament but he do that now it would be toosirius 
 
 she gasped gazing at the fire ron dropped his quill there in the middle of the dancing flames sat head long dark hair failing around his grinning face 
 
 i was starting to think go to bed before everyone else had disappeared he said been checking every hour 
 
 been popping into the fire every hour harry said 
 
 just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear 
 
 but what if been seen said hermione anxiously 
 
 well i think a by the look of get a glimpse of me earlier but worry sirius said hastily as hermione clapped a hand to her mouth i was gone the moment she looked back at me and bet she just thought i was an log or something 
 
 but sirius this is taking an awful risk hermione began 
 
 you sound like molly said sirius this was the only way i could come up with of answering letter without resorting to a codeand codes are breakable 
 
 at the mention of letter hermione and ron both turned to stare at him 
 
 you say written to sirius said hermione accusingly 
 
 i forgot said harry which was perfectly true his meeting with cho in the owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind look at me like that hermione there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it was there sirius 
 
 no it was very good said sirius smiling anyway better be quick just in case disturbedyour scar 
 
 what about ron began but hermione interrupted him 
 
 tell you afterwards go on sirius 
 
 well i know it be fun when it hurts but we think its anything to really worry about it kept aching all last year it 
 
 yeah and dumbledore said it happened whenever voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion said harry ignoring as usual ron and winces so maybe he was just i dunno really angry or something the night i had that detention 
 
 well now back bound to hurt more often said sirius 
 
 so you think it had anything to do with umbridge touching me when i was in detention with her harry asked 
 
 i doubt it said sirius i know her by reputation and sure no death eater 
 
 foul enough to be one said harry darkly and ron and hermione nodded vigorously in agreement 
 
 yes but the world split into good people and death eaters said sirius with a wry smile i know a nasty piece of work thoughyou should hear remus talk about her 
 
 does lupin know her asked harry quickly remembering comments about dangerous during her first lesson 
 
 no said sirius but she drafted a bit of legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job 
 
 harry remembered how much shabbier lupin looked these days and his dislike of umbridge deepened even further 
 
 she got against werewolves said hermione angrily 
 
 scared of them i expect said sirius smiling at her indignation apparently she loathes she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like kreacher on the loose 
 
 ron laughed but hermione looked upset 
 
 sirius she said reproachfully honestly if you made a bit of an effort with kreacher sure respond after all you are the only member of his family got left and professor dumbledore said 
 
 so what are lessons like sirius interrupted is she training you all to kill 
 
 no said harry ignoring affronted look at being cut off in her defence of kreacher not letting us use magic at all 
 
 all we do is read the stupid textbook said ron 
 
 ah well that figures said sirius our information from inside the ministry is that fudge want you trained in combat 
 
 trained in combat repeated harry incredulously what does he think doing here forming some sort of wizard army 
 
 exactly what he thinks doing said sirius or rather exactly what afraid doingforming his own private army with which he will be able to take on the ministry of magic 
 
 there was a pause at this then ron said the most stupid thing ever heard including all the stuff that luna lovegood comes out with 
 
 so being prevented from learning defence against the dark arts because fudge is scared use spells against the ministry said hermione looking furious 
 
 yep said sirius fudge thinks dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power getting more paranoid about dumbledore by the day a matter of time before he has dumbledore arrested on some charge 
 
 this reminded harry of letter 
 
 know if going to be anything about dumbledore in the daily prophet tomorrow brother percy reckons there will be 
 
 i know said sirius i seen anyone from the order all weekend all busy just been kreacher and me here 
 
 there was a definite note of bitterness in voice 
 
 so you had any news about hagrid either 
 
 ah said sirius well he was supposed to be back by now no sure happened to him then seeing their stricken faces he added quickly but not worried so you three get yourselves in a state sure fine 
 
 but if he was supposed to be back by now said hermione in a small anxious voice 
 
 madame maxime was with him been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey homebut nothing to suggest hurt orwell nothing to suggest not perfectly ok 
 
 unconvinced harry ron and hermione exchanged worried looks 
 
 listen go asking too many questions about hagrid said sirius hastily just draw even more attention to the fact that not back and i know dumbledore want that tough be ok and when they did not appear cheered by this sirius added your next hogsmeade weekend anyway i was thinking we got away with the dog disguise at the station we i thought i could 
 
 no said harry and hermione together very loudly 
 
 sirius you see the daily prophet said hermione anxiously 
 
 oh that said sirius grinning always guessing where i am they really got a clue 
 
 yeah but we think this time they have said harry something malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you and his father was on the platform sirius you know lucius malfoyso come up here whatever you do if malfoy recognises you again 
 
 all right all right got the point said sirius he looked most displeased just an idea thought you might like to get together 
 
 i would i just want you chucked back in azkaban said harry 
 
 there was a pause in which sirius looked out of the fire at harry a crease between his sunken eyes 
 
 less like your father than i thought he said finally a definite coolness in his voice the risk been what made it fun for james 
 
 look 
 
 well better get going i can hear kreacher coming down the stairs said sirius but harry was sure he was lying write to tell you a time i can make it back into the fire then shall i if you can stand to risk it 
 
 there was a tiny pop and the place where head had been was flickering flame once more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
