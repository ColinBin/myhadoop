 socrates adeimantus 
 last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical and how does he live in happiness or in misery 
 yes he said he is the only one remaining 
 there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered 
 what question 
 i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused 
 well he said it is not too late to supply the omission 
 very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them 
 which appetites do you mean 
 i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit 
 most true he said 
 but when a pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions 
 i quite agree 
 in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless nature which peers out in sleep pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me 
 yes i agree 
 and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament 
 true 
 and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his meanness at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch 
 yes he said that was our view of him and is so still 
 and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his principles 
 i can imagine him 
 then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones as soon as these dire magicians and find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him 
 yes he said that is the only adequate image of him 
 and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full 
 yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated 
 and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant 
 i should not wonder 
 further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 
 he has 
 and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods 
 that he will 
 and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate o my friend is not that so 
 assuredly 
 such is the man and such is his origin and next how does he live 
 suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me 
 i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul 
 that is certain 
 yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many 
 they are indeed he said 
 his revenues if he has any are soon spent 
 true 
 then comes debt and the cutting down of his property 
 of course 
 when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them 
 yes that is sure to be the case 
 he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs 
 he must 
 and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs 
 no doubt he will 
 and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them 
 very true 
 and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them 
 yes probably 
 and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them 
 nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents 
 but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable 
 yes indeed he said i believe that he would 
 truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother 
 he is indeed he replied 
 he first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself have we not here a picture of his way of life 
 yes indeed he said 
 and if there are only a few of them in the state the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city 
 what sort of mischief 
 for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of temples of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes 
 a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number 
 yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant 
 yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 
 if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters this is the end of his passions and desires 
 exactly 
 when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more 
 yes truly 
 they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship 
 certainly not 
 and may we not rightly call such men treacherous 
 no question 
 also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice 
 yes he said and we were perfectly right 
 let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed 
 most true 
 and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes 
 socrates glaucon 
 that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer 
 and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general 
 yes he said inevitably 
 and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others 
 certainly 
 and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man 
 to be sure 
 then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue 
 they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst 
 there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery and here we must not allow ourselves to be at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion 
 a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest 
 and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men 
 that again he said is a very fair proposal 
 shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries 
 by all means 
 let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions 
 what do you mean he asked 
 beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved 
 no city he said can be more completely enslaved 
 and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state 
 yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved 
 then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest 
 inevitably 
 and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave 
 he has the soul of a slave in my opinion 
 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily 
 utterly incapable 
 and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse 
 certainly 
 and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor 
 poor 
 and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable 
 true 
 and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear 
 yes indeed 
 is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain 
 certainly not 
 and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires 
 impossible 
 reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states 
 and i was right he said 
 certainly i said and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him 
 i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men 
 there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong 
 what do you mean 
 i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery 
 then who is more miserable 
 one of whom i am about to speak 
 who is that 
 he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant 
 from what has been said i gather that you are right 
 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest 
 very true he said 
 let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject 
 what is your illustration 
 the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves 
 yes that is the difference 
 you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants 
 what should they fear 
 nothing but do you observe the reason of this 
 yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual 
 very true i said but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves 
 yes he said he will be in the utmost fear 
 the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants 
 yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself 
 and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life 
 his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies 
 and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest 
 very true he said 
 and amid evils such as these will not he who is in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men 
 yes he said the similitude is most exact 
 is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst 
 certainly 
 he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds 
 very true he said 
 moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself 
 no man of any sense will dispute your words 
 come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical 
 the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery 
 need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state 
 make the proclamation yourself he said 
 and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 let the words be added 
 then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight 
 what is that 
 the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration 
 of what nature 
 it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers 
 how do you mean he said 
 there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money 
 that is true he said 
 if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money 
 i agree with you 
 again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame 
 true 
 suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable 
 extremely suitable 
 on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame 
 far less 
 lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul 
 certainly 
 one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen 
 yes 
 then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain 
 exactly 
 and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects 
 very true 
 now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver 
 true he said 
 and the lover of honour what will be his opinion will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him 
 very true 
 and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them 
 there can be no doubt of that he replied 
 since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly 
 i cannot myself tell he said 
 well but what ought to be the criterion is any better than experience and wisdom and reason 
 there cannot be a better he said 
 then i said reflect of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain 
 the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth 
 then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience 
 yes very great 
 again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom 
 nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only 
 his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one 
 far better 
 and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience 
 certainly 
 further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher 
 what faculty 
 reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest 
 yes 
 and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument 
 certainly 
 if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy 
 assuredly 
 or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest 
 clearly 
 but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges 
 the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 
 and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life 
 unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life 
 and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next 
 clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the 
 last comes the lover of gain 
 very true he said 
 twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls 
 yes the greatest but will you explain yourself 
 i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions 
 proceed 
 say then is not pleasure opposed to pain 
 true 
 and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain 
 there is 
 a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean 
 yes 
 you remember what people say when they are sick 
 what do they say 
 that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill 
 yes i know he said 
 and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain 
 i have 
 and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure 
 yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest 
 again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful 
 doubtless he said 
 then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain 
 so it would seem 
 but can that which is neither become both 
 i should say not 
 and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not 
 yes 
 but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them 
 yes 
 how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain 
 impossible 
 this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition 
 that is the inference 
 look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 what are they he said and where shall i find them 
 there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them 
 most true he said 
 let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 no 
 still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain 
 that is true 
 and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature 
 yes 
 shall i give you an illustration of them 
 let me hear 
 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region 
 i should 
 and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world 
 to be sure he said how can he think otherwise 
 but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending 
 no doubt 
 all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions 
 yes 
 then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this 
 no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite 
 look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state 
 yes 
 and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul 
 true 
 and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either 
 certainly 
 and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer 
 clearly from that which has more 
 what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal 
 far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable 
 and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence 
 yes of knowledge in the same degree 
 and of truth in the same degree 
 yes 
 and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence 
 necessarily 
 then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul 
 far less 
 and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul 
 yes 
 what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real 
 of course 
 and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure 
 unquestionably 
 those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent 
 verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle 
 their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth 
 something of that sort must inevitably happen 
 and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense 
 yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also 
 then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him 
 yes certainly the best is the most natural 
 and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable 
 exactly 
 but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own 
 true 
 and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure 
 yes 
 and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order 
 clearly 
 and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance yes 
 and the royal and orderly desires are nearest 
 yes 
 then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least 
 certainly 
 but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly 
 inevitably 
 would you know the measure of the interval which separates them 
 will you tell me 
 there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure 
 how do you mean 
 i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle 
 yes 
 and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch 
 he will 
 and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical 
 yes he is third 
 then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three 
 manifestly 
 the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure 
 certainly 
 and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king 
 yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum 
 or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is complete living times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval 
 what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain 
 yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 
 yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them 
 then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue 
 immeasurably greater 
 well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just 
 yes that was said 
 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him 
 what shall we say to him 
 let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes 
 of what sort 
 an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one 
 there are said of have been such unions 
 then do you now model the form of a multitudinous monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will 
 you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose 
 suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second 
 that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say 
 and now join them and let the three grow into one 
 that has been accomplished 
 next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature i have done so he said 
 and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another 
 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says 
 to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature 
 he should watch over the monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself 
 yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say 
 and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant 
 yes from every point of view 
 come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now 
 not if he has any regard for my opinion 
 but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin 
 yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him 
 has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large 
 clearly 
 and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength 
 yes 
 and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him 
 very true 
 and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey 
 true he said 
 and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them 
 such appears to be the reason 
 and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals 
 true he said 
 and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways 
 yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest 
 from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness 
 from no point of view at all 
 what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body 
 certainly he said 
 to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others 
 clearly he said 
 in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul 
 certainly he will if he has true music in him 
 and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm 
 certainly not he said 
 he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means 
 very true 
 and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid 
 then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman 
 by the dog of egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call 
 i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth 
 in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other 
 i think so he said

 book ix 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical and how does he live in happiness or in misery 
 yes he said he is the only one remaining 
 there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered 
 what question 
 i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused 
 well he said it is not too late to supply the omission 
 very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them 
 which appetites do you mean 
 i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit 
 most true he said 
 but when a pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions 
 i quite agree 
 in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless nature which peers out in sleep pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me 
 yes i agree 
 and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament 
 true 
 and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his meanness at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch 
 yes he said that was our view of him and is so still 
 and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his principles 
 i can imagine him 
 then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones as soon as these dire magicians and find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him 
 yes he said that is the only adequate image of him 
 and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full 
 yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated 
 and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant 
 i should not wonder 
 further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 
 he has 
 and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods 
 that he will 
 and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate o my friend is not that so 
 assuredly 
 such is the man and such is his origin and next how does he live 
 suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me 
 i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul 
 that is certain 
 yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many 
 they are indeed he said 
 his revenues if he has any are soon spent 
 true 
 then comes debt and the cutting down of his property 
 of course 
 when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them 
 yes that is sure to be the case 
 he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs 
 he must 
 and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs 
 no doubt he will 
 and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them 
 very true 
 and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them 
 yes probably 
 and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them 
 nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents 
 but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable 
 yes indeed he said i believe that he would 
 truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother 
 he is indeed he replied 
 he first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself have we not here a picture of his way of life 
 yes indeed he said 
 and if there are only a few of them in the state the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city 
 what sort of mischief 
 for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of temples of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes 
 a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number 
 yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant 
 yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 
 if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters this is the end of his passions and desires 
 exactly 
 when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more 
 yes truly 
 they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship 
 certainly not 
 and may we not rightly call such men treacherous 
 no question 
 also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice 
 yes he said and we were perfectly right 
 let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed 
 most true 
 and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes 
 socrates glaucon 
 that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer 
 and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general 
 yes he said inevitably 
 and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others 
 certainly 
 and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man 
 to be sure 
 then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue 
 they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst 
 there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery and here we must not allow ourselves to be at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion 
 a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest 
 and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men 
 that again he said is a very fair proposal 
 shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries 
 by all means 
 let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions 
 what do you mean he asked 
 beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved 
 no city he said can be more completely enslaved 
 and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state 
 yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved 
 then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest 
 inevitably 
 and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave 
 he has the soul of a slave in my opinion 
 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily 
 utterly incapable 
 and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse 
 certainly 
 and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor 
 poor 
 and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable 
 true 
 and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear 
 yes indeed 
 is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain 
 certainly not 
 and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires 
 impossible 
 reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states 
 and i was right he said 
 certainly i said and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him 
 i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men 
 there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong 
 what do you mean 
 i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery 
 then who is more miserable 
 one of whom i am about to speak 
 who is that 
 he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant 
 from what has been said i gather that you are right 
 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest 
 very true he said 
 let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject 
 what is your illustration 
 the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves 
 yes that is the difference 
 you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants 
 what should they fear 
 nothing but do you observe the reason of this 
 yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual 
 very true i said but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves 
 yes he said he will be in the utmost fear 
 the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants 
 yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself 
 and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life 
 his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies 
 and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest 
 very true he said 
 and amid evils such as these will not he who is in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men 
 yes he said the similitude is most exact 
 is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst 
 certainly 
 he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds 
 very true he said 
 moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself 
 no man of any sense will dispute your words 
 come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical 
 the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery 
 need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state 
 make the proclamation yourself he said 
 and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 let the words be added 
 then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight 
 what is that 
 the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration 
 of what nature 
 it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers 
 how do you mean he said 
 there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money 
 that is true he said 
 if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money 
 i agree with you 
 again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame 
 true 
 suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable 
 extremely suitable 
 on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame 
 far less 
 lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul 
 certainly 
 one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen 
 yes 
 then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain 
 exactly 
 and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects 
 very true 
 now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver 
 true he said 
 and the lover of honour what will be his opinion will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him 
 very true 
 and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them 
 there can be no doubt of that he replied 
 since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly 
 i cannot myself tell he said 
 well but what ought to be the criterion is any better than experience and wisdom and reason 
 there cannot be a better he said 
 then i said reflect of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain 
 the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth 
 then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience 
 yes very great 
 again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom 
 nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only 
 his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one 
 far better 
 and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience 
 certainly 
 further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher 
 what faculty 
 reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest 
 yes 
 and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument 
 certainly 
 if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy 
 assuredly 
 or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest 
 clearly 
 but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges 
 the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 
 and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life 
 unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life 
 and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next 
 clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the 
 last comes the lover of gain 
 very true he said 
 twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls 
 yes the greatest but will you explain yourself 
 i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions 
 proceed 
 say then is not pleasure opposed to pain 
 true 
 and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain 
 there is 
 a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean 
 yes 
 you remember what people say when they are sick 
 what do they say 
 that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill 
 yes i know he said 
 and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain 
 i have 
 and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure 
 yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest 
 again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful 
 doubtless he said 
 then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain 
 so it would seem 
 but can that which is neither become both 
 i should say not 
 and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not 
 yes 
 but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them 
 yes 
 how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain 
 impossible 
 this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition 
 that is the inference 
 look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 what are they he said and where shall i find them 
 there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them 
 most true he said 
 let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure 
 no 
 still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain 
 that is true 
 and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature 
 yes 
 shall i give you an illustration of them 
 let me hear 
 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region 
 i should 
 and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world 
 to be sure he said how can he think otherwise 
 but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending 
 no doubt 
 all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions 
 yes 
 then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this 
 no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite 
 look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state 
 yes 
 and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul 
 true 
 and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either 
 certainly 
 and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer 
 clearly from that which has more 
 what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal 
 far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable 
 and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence 
 yes of knowledge in the same degree 
 and of truth in the same degree 
 yes 
 and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence 
 necessarily 
 then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul 
 far less 
 and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul 
 yes 
 what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real 
 of course 
 and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure 
 unquestionably 
 those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent 
 verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle 
 their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth 
 something of that sort must inevitably happen 
 and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense 
 yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also 
 then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him 
 yes certainly the best is the most natural 
 and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable 
 exactly 
 but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own 
 true 
 and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure 
 yes 
 and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order 
 clearly 
 and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance yes 
 and the royal and orderly desires are nearest 
 yes 
 then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least 
 certainly 
 but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly 
 inevitably 
 would you know the measure of the interval which separates them 
 will you tell me 
 there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure 
 how do you mean 
 i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle 
 yes 
 and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch 
 he will 
 and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical 
 yes he is third 
 then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three 
 manifestly 
 the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure 
 certainly 
 and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king 
 yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum 
 or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is complete living times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval 
 what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain 
 yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 
 yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them 
 then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue 
 immeasurably greater 
 well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just 
 yes that was said 
 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him 
 what shall we say to him 
 let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes 
 of what sort 
 an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one 
 there are said of have been such unions 
 then do you now model the form of a multitudinous monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will 
 you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose 
 suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second 
 that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say 
 and now join them and let the three grow into one 
 that has been accomplished 
 next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature i have done so he said 
 and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another 
 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says 
 to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature 
 he should watch over the monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself 
 yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say 
 and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant 
 yes from every point of view 
 come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now 
 not if he has any regard for my opinion 
 but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin 
 yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him 
 has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large 
 clearly 
 and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength 
 yes 
 and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him 
 very true 
 and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey 
 true he said 
 and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them 
 such appears to be the reason 
 and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals 
 true he said 
 and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways 
 yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest 
 from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness 
 from no point of view at all 
 what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body 
 certainly he said 
 to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others 
 clearly he said 
 in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul 
 certainly he will if he has true music in him 
 and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm 
 certainly not he said 
 he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means 
 very true 
 and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid 
 then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman 
 by the dog of egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call 
 i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth 
 in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other 
 i think so he said

 book x 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry 
 to what do you refer 
 to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished 
 what do you mean 
 speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them 
 explain the purport of your remark 
 well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out 
 very good he said 
 listen to me then or rather answer me 
 put your question 
 can you tell me what imitation is for i really do not know 
 a likely thing then that i should know 
 why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener 
 very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it will you enquire yourself 
 well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me 
 i do 
 let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not 
 yes 
 but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table 
 true 
 and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he 
 impossible 
 and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him 
 who is he 
 one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen 
 what an extraordinary man 
 wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also 
 he must be a wizard and no mistake 
 oh you are incredulous are you do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself 
 what way 
 an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror 
 yes he said but they would be appearances only 
 very good i said you are coming to the point now and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not 
 of course 
 but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed 
 yes he said but not a real bed 
 and what of the maker of the bed were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed 
 yes i did 
 then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth 
 at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth 
 no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth 
 no wonder 
 suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is 
 if you please 
 well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker 
 no 
 there is another which is the work of the carpenter 
 yes 
 and the work of the painter is a third 
 yes 
 beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter 
 yes there are three of them 
 god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god 
 why is that 
 because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and the two others 
 very true he said 
 god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only 
 so we believe 
 shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed 
 yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things 
 and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed 
 yes 
 but would you call the painter a creator and maker 
 certainly not 
 yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed 
 i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make 
 good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator 
 certainly he said 
 and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth 
 that appears to be so 
 then about the imitator we are agreed and what about the painter i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists 
 the latter 
 as they are or as they appear you have still to determine this 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality and the same of all things 
 yes he said the difference is only apparent 
 now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality 
 of appearance 
 then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter 
 certainly 
 and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation 
 most true 
 and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well 
 the question he said should by all means be considered 
 now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the branch would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him 
 i should say not 
 the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them 
 yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit 
 then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you is there any city which he might name 
 i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator 
 well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive 
 there is not 
 or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him 
 there is absolutely nothing of the kind 
 but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him 
 nothing of the kind is recorded of him for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive 
 yes i replied that is the tradition but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough 
 yes socrates that i think is quite true 
 then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures 
 quite so 
 in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose 
 yes he said 
 they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them 
 exactly 
 here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only am i not right 
 yes 
 then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation 
 proceed 
 of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit 
 yes 
 and the worker in leather and brass will make them 
 certainly 
 but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form 
 most true 
 and may we not say the same of all things 
 what 
 that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them 
 yes 
 and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them 
 true 
 then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the will tell the which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions 
 of course 
 the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him 
 true 
 the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge 
 true 
 but will the imitator have either will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw 
 neither 
 then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations 
 i suppose not 
 the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations 
 nay very much the reverse 
 and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude 
 just so 
 thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree 
 very true 
 and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth 
 certainly 
 and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed 
 what do you mean 
 i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance 
 true 
 and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic 
 true 
 and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight 
 most true 
 and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul 
 to be sure 
 and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction 
 true 
 but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing 
 very true 
 then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure 
 true 
 and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation 
 certainly 
 and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul 
 no doubt 
 this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim 
 exactly 
 the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring 
 very true 
 and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry 
 probably the same would be true of poetry 
 do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad 
 by all means 
 we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly is there anything more 
 no there is nothing else 
 but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment 
 and we were right he said 
 yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied 
 what was the omission 
 were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another 
 yes 
 but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow 
 the latter he said is the truer statement 
 tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone 
 it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not 
 when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do 
 true 
 there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow 
 true 
 but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him 
 certainly 
 one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law 
 how do you mean 
 the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required 
 what is most required he asked 
 that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art 
 yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune 
 yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason 
 clearly 
 and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly 
 indeed we may 
 and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers 
 certainly 
 then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated 
 clearly 
 and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 
 exactly 
 but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing 
 yes certainly if the effect is what you say 
 hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most 
 yes of course i know 
 but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman 
 very true he said 
 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person 
 no he said that is certainly not reasonable 
 nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view 
 what point of view 
 if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own 
 how very true 
 and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home 
 quite true he said 
 and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue 
 i cannot deny it 
 therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state 
 that is most true he said 
 and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us but that she may impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer 
 yes indeed i am greatly charmed 
 shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre 
 certainly 
 and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight 
 certainly he said we shall the gainers 
 if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law 
 yes he said i quite agree with you 
 yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue 
 yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been 
 and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue 
 what are there any greater still if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness 
 why i said what was ever great in a short time the whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity 
 say rather nothing he replied 
 and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole 
 of the whole certainly but why do you ask 
 are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable 
 he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this 
 yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it 
 i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light 
 listen then 
 i am attending 
 there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil 
 yes he replied 
 would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good 
 yes 
 and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease 
 yes he said 
 and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies 
 true 
 the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil 
 certainly not 
 if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction 
 that may be assumed 
 well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul 
 yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance 
 but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them is not this true 
 yes 
 consider the soul in like manner does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body 
 certainly not 
 and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own 
 it is he replied 
 consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny 
 very true 
 and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another 
 yes he said there is reason in that 
 either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man 
 and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death 
 but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds 
 nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her from being a house of death 
 true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction 
 yes that can hardly be 
 but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal 
 certainly 
 that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality 
 very true 
 but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity 
 what do you mean he said 
 the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements 
 certainly not 
 her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills but not there glaucon not there must we look 
 where then 
 at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her nature is of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough 
 true he replied 
 and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades 
 very true 
 and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death 
 certainly not he said 
 will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument 
 what did i borrow 
 the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice do you remember 
 i should be much to blame if i had forgotten 
 then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own 
 the demand he said is just 
 in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods 
 granted 
 and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning 
 true 
 and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins 
 certainly 
 then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue 
 yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him 
 and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed 
 certainly 
 such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just 
 that is my conviction 
 and what do they receive of men look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow 
 true 
 and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true 
 certainly he said what you say is true 
 these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides 
 yes he said and they are fair and lasting 
 and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them 
 speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear 
 socrates 
 well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great 
 now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the of a trireme from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second the largest of fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other 
 when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality your genius will not be allotted to you but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities and of women likewise there was not however any definite character them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come for this is the way of happiness 
 and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him the judgment about the arms the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations 
 all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting he himself was hindered from drinking the water but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre 
 and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

 book x 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry 
 to what do you refer 
 to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished 
 what do you mean 
 speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them 
 explain the purport of your remark 
 well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out 
 very good he said 
 listen to me then or rather answer me 
 put your question 
 can you tell me what imitation is for i really do not know 
 a likely thing then that i should know 
 why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener 
 very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it will you enquire yourself 
 well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me 
 i do 
 let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not 
 yes 
 but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table 
 true 
 and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he 
 impossible 
 and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him 
 who is he 
 one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen 
 what an extraordinary man 
 wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also 
 he must be a wizard and no mistake 
 oh you are incredulous are you do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself 
 what way 
 an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror 
 yes he said but they would be appearances only 
 very good i said you are coming to the point now and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not 
 of course 
 but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed 
 yes he said but not a real bed 
 and what of the maker of the bed were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed 
 yes i did 
 then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth 
 at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth 
 no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth 
 no wonder 
 suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is 
 if you please 
 well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker 
 no 
 there is another which is the work of the carpenter 
 yes 
 and the work of the painter is a third 
 yes 
 beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter 
 yes there are three of them 
 god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god 
 why is that 
 because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and the two others 
 very true he said 
 god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only 
 so we believe 
 shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed 
 yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things 
 and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed 
 yes 
 but would you call the painter a creator and maker 
 certainly not 
 yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed 
 i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make 
 good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator 
 certainly he said 
 and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth 
 that appears to be so 
 then about the imitator we are agreed and what about the painter i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists 
 the latter 
 as they are or as they appear you have still to determine this 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality and the same of all things 
 yes he said the difference is only apparent 
 now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality 
 of appearance 
 then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter 
 certainly 
 and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation 
 most true 
 and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well 
 the question he said should by all means be considered 
 now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the branch would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him 
 i should say not 
 the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them 
 yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit 
 then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you is there any city which he might name 
 i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator 
 well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive 
 there is not 
 or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him 
 there is absolutely nothing of the kind 
 but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him 
 nothing of the kind is recorded of him for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive 
 yes i replied that is the tradition but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough 
 yes socrates that i think is quite true 
 then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures 
 quite so 
 in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose 
 yes he said 
 they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them 
 exactly 
 here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only am i not right 
 yes 
 then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation 
 proceed 
 of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit 
 yes 
 and the worker in leather and brass will make them 
 certainly 
 but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form 
 most true 
 and may we not say the same of all things 
 what 
 that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them 
 yes 
 and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them 
 true 
 then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the will tell the which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions 
 of course 
 the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him 
 true 
 the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge 
 true 
 but will the imitator have either will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw 
 neither 
 then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations 
 i suppose not 
 the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations 
 nay very much the reverse 
 and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude 
 just so 
 thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree 
 very true 
 and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth 
 certainly 
 and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed 
 what do you mean 
 i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance 
 true 
 and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic 
 true 
 and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight 
 most true 
 and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul 
 to be sure 
 and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction 
 true 
 but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing 
 very true 
 then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure 
 true 
 and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation 
 certainly 
 and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul 
 no doubt 
 this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim 
 exactly 
 the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring 
 very true 
 and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry 
 probably the same would be true of poetry 
 do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad 
 by all means 
 we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly is there anything more 
 no there is nothing else 
 but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment 
 and we were right he said 
 yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied 
 what was the omission 
 were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another 
 yes 
 but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow 
 the latter he said is the truer statement 
 tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone 
 it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not 
 when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do 
 true 
 there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow 
 true 
 but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him 
 certainly 
 one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law 
 how do you mean 
 the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required 
 what is most required he asked 
 that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art 
 yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune 
 yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason 
 clearly 
 and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly 
 indeed we may 
 and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers 
 certainly 
 then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated 
 clearly 
 and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 
 exactly 
 but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing 
 yes certainly if the effect is what you say 
 hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most 
 yes of course i know 
 but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman 
 very true he said 
 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person 
 no he said that is certainly not reasonable 
 nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view 
 what point of view 
 if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own 
 how very true 
 and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home 
 quite true he said 
 and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue 
 i cannot deny it 
 therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state 
 that is most true he said 
 and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us but that she may impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer 
 yes indeed i am greatly charmed 
 shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre 
 certainly 
 and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight 
 certainly he said we shall the gainers 
 if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law 
 yes he said i quite agree with you 
 yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue 
 yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been 
 and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue 
 what are there any greater still if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness 
 why i said what was ever great in a short time the whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity 
 say rather nothing he replied 
 and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole 
 of the whole certainly but why do you ask 
 are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable 
 he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this 
 yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it 
 i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light 
 listen then 
 i am attending 
 there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil 
 yes he replied 
 would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good 
 yes 
 and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease 
 yes he said 
 and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies 
 true 
 the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil 
 certainly not 
 if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction 
 that may be assumed 
 well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul 
 yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance 
 but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them is not this true 
 yes 
 consider the soul in like manner does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body 
 certainly not 
 and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own 
 it is he replied 
 consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny 
 very true 
 and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another 
 yes he said there is reason in that 
 either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man 
 and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death 
 but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds 
 nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her from being a house of death 
 true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction 
 yes that can hardly be 
 but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal 
 certainly 
 that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality 
 very true 
 but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity 
 what do you mean he said 
 the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements 
 certainly not 
 her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills but not there glaucon not there must we look 
 where then 
 at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her nature is of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough 
 true he replied 
 and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades 
 very true 
 and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death 
 certainly not he said 
 will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument 
 what did i borrow 
 the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice do you remember 
 i should be much to blame if i had forgotten 
 then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own 
 the demand he said is just 
 in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods 
 granted 
 and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning 
 true 
 and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins 
 certainly 
 then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue 
 yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him 
 and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed 
 certainly 
 such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just 
 that is my conviction 
 and what do they receive of men look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow 
 true 
 and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true 
 certainly he said what you say is true 
 these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides 
 yes he said and they are fair and lasting 
 and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them 
 speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear 
 socrates 
 well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great 
 now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the of a trireme from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second the largest of fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other 
 when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality your genius will not be allotted to you but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities and of women likewise there was not however any definite character them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come for this is the way of happiness 
 and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him the judgment about the arms the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations 
 all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting he himself was hindered from drinking the water but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre 
 and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

 of death 
 men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales so is the other certainly the contemplation of death as the wages of sin and passage to another world is holy and religious but the fear of it as a tribute due unto nature is weak yet in religious meditations there is sometimes mixture of vanity and of superstition 
 you shall read in some of the friars books of mortifications that a man should think with himself what the pain is if he have but his end pressed or tortured and thereby imagine what the pains of death are when the whole body is corrupted and dissolved when many times death passeth with less pain then the torture of a limb for the most vital parts are not the quickest of sense and by him that spoke only as a philosopher and natural man it was well said pompa mortis magis terret quam mars ipsa groans and convulsions and a discoloured face and friends weeping and blacks and obsequies and the like show death terrible it is worthy the observing that there is no passion in the mind of man so weak but it mates and masters the fear of death and therefore death is no such terrible enemy when a man hath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him revenge triumphs over death love slights it honour aspireth to it grief flieth to it fear preoccupieth it nay we read after otho the emperor had slain himself pity which is the tenderest of affections provoked many to die out of mere compassion to their sovereign and as the truest sort of followers nay seneca adds niceness and satiety cogita quarn diu eadem feceris mori velle non tantun fortis out miser sed etiam fastidiosus potest 
 a man would die though he were neither valiant nor miserable only upon a weariness to do the same thing so oft over and over it is no less worthy to observe how little alteration in good spirits die approaches of death make for they appear to be the same men till the last instant augustus caesar died in a compliment livia coniugii nostri memor vive et vale tiberius in dissimulation as tacitus saith of him mm tiberium vires et corpus non dissimulatio deserebant vespasian in a jest sitting upon the stool ut puto deus fio galba with a si ex re sit populi romani holding forth his neck septimius severus in dispatch quid mihi restat agendum and the like certainly the stoics bestowed too much cost upon death and by their great preparations made it appear more fearful better saith he qui finem vitae extremism inter munera ponat naturae it is as natural to die as to be born and to a little infant perhaps the one is as painful as the other he that dies in an earnest pursuit is like one that is wounded in hot blood who for the time scarce feels the therefore a mind fixed and bent upon somewhat that 
 is good doth avert me dolours of death but above all believe it the sweetest 
 canticle is minc difmittis when a man hath obtained worthy ends and expectations 
 
 death hath this also that it openeth the gate to good fame and extinguisheth envy exstinctus amabitur idem

 of death 
 men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales so is the other certainly the contemplation of death as the wages of sin and passage to another world is holy and religious but the fear of it as a tribute due unto nature is weak yet in religious meditations there is sometimes mixture of vanity and of superstition 
 you shall read in some of the friars books of mortifications that a man should think with himself what the pain is if he have but his end pressed or tortured and thereby imagine what the pains of death are when the whole body is corrupted and dissolved when many times death passeth with less pain then the torture of a limb for the most vital parts are not the quickest of sense and by him that spoke only as a philosopher and natural man it was well said pompa mortis magis terret quam mars ipsa groans and convulsions and a discoloured face and friends weeping and blacks and obsequies and the like show death terrible it is worthy the observing that there is no passion in the mind of man so weak but it mates and masters the fear of death and therefore death is no such terrible enemy when a man hath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him revenge triumphs over death love slights it honour aspireth to it grief flieth to it fear preoccupieth it nay we read after otho the emperor had slain himself pity which is the tenderest of affections provoked many to die out of mere compassion to their sovereign and as the truest sort of followers nay seneca adds niceness and satiety cogita quarn diu eadem feceris mori velle non tantun fortis out miser sed etiam fastidiosus potest 
 a man would die though he were neither valiant nor miserable only upon a weariness to do the same thing so oft over and over it is no less worthy to observe how little alteration in good spirits die approaches of death make for they appear to be the same men till the last instant augustus caesar died in a compliment livia coniugii nostri memor vive et vale tiberius in dissimulation as tacitus saith of him mm tiberium vires et corpus non dissimulatio deserebant vespasian in a jest sitting upon the stool ut puto deus fio galba with a si ex re sit populi romani holding forth his neck septimius severus in dispatch quid mihi restat agendum and the like certainly the stoics bestowed too much cost upon death and by their great preparations made it appear more fearful better saith he qui finem vitae extremism inter munera ponat naturae it is as natural to die as to be born and to a little infant perhaps the one is as painful as the other he that dies in an earnest pursuit is like one that is wounded in hot blood who for the time scarce feels the therefore a mind fixed and bent upon somewhat that 
 is good doth avert me dolours of death but above all believe it the sweetest 
 canticle is minc difmittis when a man hath obtained worthy ends and expectations 
 
 death hath this also that it openeth the gate to good fame and extinguisheth envy exstinctus amabitur idem

 m myriel 
 in m myriel was bishop of d he was an old man of about years of age he had occupied the see of d since 
 although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous if merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese 
 true or false that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives and above all in their destinies as that which they do m myriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of aix hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar 
 it was said that his father destining him to be the heir of his own post had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families in spite of this marriage however it was said that charles myriel created a great deal of talk 
 he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry 
 the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed 
 m charles myriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution 
 there his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered 
 he had no children what took place next in the fate of m myriel 
 the ruin of the french society of the olden days the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance with the magnifying powers of these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him 
 was he in the midst of these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune 
 no one could have told 
 all that was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest 
 in m myriel was the cure of b brignolles he was already advanced in years and lived in a very retired manner 
 about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his what is not precisely him to paris

 sire said m myriel you are looking at a good man and i at a great man 
 each of us can profit by it 
 that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and some time afterwards m myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of d 
 what truth was there after all in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m life 
 no one knew very few families had been acquainted with the myriel family before the revolution 
 m myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town where there are many mouths which talk and very few heads which think he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop

 no one would have dared to mention them no one would have dared to recall them 
 m myriel had arrived at d accompanied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptistine who was his sister and ten years his junior 
 their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle baptistine and named madame magloire who after having been the servant of m le cure now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur 
 mademoiselle baptistine was a long pale thin gentle creature she realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen she was a soul rather than a virgin 
 her person seemed made of a shadow there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex a little matter enclosing a light large eyes forever drooping a mere pretext for a remaining on the earth 
 madame magloire was a little fat white old woman corpulent and bustling always out of the first place because of her activity and in the next because of her asthma 
 on his arrival m myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop immediately after a the mayor and the president paid the first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the general and the prefect

 he bows and leaves 
 
 doctor 
 bowing smiling at the princess 
 goodnight 
 
 ann 
 goodnight doctor 
 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her 
 running through the buildings further she pauses her back against a wall looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck while he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck the man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding he then gets in starts the motor and drives off guards at the entrace of the embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the embassy recede into the distance she looks round with delight moving the bag out of the way leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better she watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe busy with people then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter the woman waves back at her the goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around and ann rests on a box closing her eyes

 later the countess enters the bedchamber followed by doctor bonnachoven and the general they walk to her bed and the doctor looks at ann who move 
 
 doctor 
 to the countess puzzled

 she puts her hand over her mouth covering her smile 
 
 general 
 embarrassed straightening his bedrobe 
 perfectly alright 
 
 to the princess 
 goodnight 
 
 he bows and leaves 
 
 doctor 
 bowing smiling at the princess 
 goodnight 
 
 ann 
 goodnight doctor 
 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her 
 running through the buildings further she pauses her back against a wall looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck while he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck the man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding he then gets in starts the motor and drives off guards at the entrace of the embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the embassy recede into the distance she looks round with delight moving the bag out of the way leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better she watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe busy with people then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter the woman waves back at her the goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around and ann rests on a box closing her eyes 
 the truck continues through the city but ann is awakened when the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front as it is stopped she hops out running to the footpath as the truck screeches away she leans against a tree yawning then continues on 
 crossing a street she walks straight across the passenger cabin of a carriage parked alongside the pavement to the bewilderment of the passengers and driver the cab drives away as ann continues on 
 a light pours from the window of a room on the second floor of the building the carriage was parked in front of
