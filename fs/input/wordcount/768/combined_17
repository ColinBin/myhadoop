lionfish nov chapter four the leaky cauldroncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 it took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle world 
 
 harry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a shopping wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today warlocks raucous dwarfs and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woolen balaclava 
 
 after breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wall 
 
 harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases a lunascope old boy no more messing around with moon charts see or else discussing the case of sirius black personally i let any of the children out alone until back in azkaban harry have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an hour 
 
 once harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons silver sickles and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts he had to exercise a lot of not to spend the whole lot at once he had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones a wizarding game rather like marbles in which the stones squirt a liquid into the other face when they lose a point he was sorely tempted too by the perfect moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball which would have meant he never had to take another astronomy lesson but the thing that tested resolution most appeared in his favorite shop quality quidditch supplies a week after arrived at the leaky cauldron 
 
 curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life 
 
 just come out prototype a wizard was telling his companion 
 
 the fastest broom in the world it dad squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his arm 
 
 irish international just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and favorites for the world cup 
 
 a large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broom 
 
 the firebolt 
 this racing broom sports a superfine handle of ash treated with a polish and with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision the firebolt has an acceleration of miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on request 
 price on requestharry like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nimbus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already harry ask for the price but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the firebolt 
 
 there were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divination 
 
 harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively 
 
 harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet 
 
 as harry entered flourish and blotts the manager came hurrying toward him 
 
 hogwarts he said abruptly come to get your new books 
 
 yes said harry i need 
 
 get out of the way said the manager impatiently brushing harry aside he drew on a pair of very thick gloves picked up a large knobbly walking stick and proceeded toward the door of the monster books cage 
 
 hang on said harry quickly already got one of those 
 
 have you a look of enormous relief spread over the face thank heavens for that been bitten five times already this morning 
 
 a loud ripping noise rent the air two of the monster books had seized a third and were pulling it apart 
 
 stop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart never stocking them again never been bedlam i thought seen the worst when we bought two hundred copies of the invisible book of invisibility cost a fortune and we never found themwellis there anything else i can help you with 
 
 yes said harry looking down his booklist i need unfogging the future by cassandra vablatsky 
 
 ah starting divination are you said the manager stripping off his gloves and leading harry into the back of the shop where there was a corner devoted to a small table was stacked with volumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself against shocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foul 
 
 here you are said the manager who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick book unfogging the future very good guide to all your basic methods palmistry crystal balls bird entrails 
 
 but harry listening his eyes had fallen on another book which was among a display on a small table death omens what to do when you know the worst is coming 
 
 oh i read that if i were you said the manager lightly looking to see what harry was staring at start seeing death omens everywhere enough to frighten anyone to death 
 
 but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes it looked oddly familiar 
 
 the manager pressed unfogging the future into hands 
 
 anything else he said 
 
 yes said harry tearing his eyes away from the and dazedly consulting his booklist er i need intermediate transfiguration and the standard book of spells grade three 
 
 harry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people 
 
 he tramped up the stairs to his room went inside and tipped his books onto his bed somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open and sun was pouring inside harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in diagon alley he caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin 
 
 it have been a death omen he told his reflection defiantly i was panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescentit was probably just a stray dog 
 
 he raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat 
 
 fighting a losing battle there dear said his mirror in a wheezy voice 
 
 as the days slipped by harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of ron or hermione plenty of hogwarts students were arriving in diagon alley now with the start of term so near harry met seamus finnigan and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into the real neville longbottom a forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts harry stop to chat neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very grandmother harry hoped she never found out that pretended to be neville while on the run from the ministry of magic 
 
 harry woke on the last day of the holidays thinking that he would at least meet ron and hermione tomorrow on the hogwarts express he got up dressed went for a last look at the firebolt and was just wondering where have lunch when someone yelled his name and he turned 
 
 harry harry 
 
 they were there both of them sitting outside florean ice cream parlor ron looking incredibly freckly hermione very brown both waving frantically at him 
 
 finally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam and 
 
 i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew staying at the leaky cauldron 
 
 dad said ron simply 
 
 mr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt marge 
 
 did you really blow up your aunt harry said hermione in a very serious voice 
 
 i mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just lost control 
 
 not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly amazed harry expelled 
 
 so am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad know why fudge let me off does he 
 
 probably cause you it shrugged ron still chuckling famous harry potter and all that hate to see what the do to me if i blew up an aunt mind you have to dig me up first because mum killed me anyway you can ask dad yourself this evening staying at the leaky cauldron tonight too so you can come to cross with us tomorrow there as well 
 
 hermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts things 
 
 excellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stuff 
 
 look at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn and got all our books he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two 
 
 all that hermione harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her 
 
 well taking more new subjects than you i said hermione those are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination the study of ancient runes muggle studies 
 
 what are you doing muggle studies for said ron rolling his eyes at harry your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about muggles 
 
 but be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestly 
 
 are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored them 
 
 still got ten galleons she said checking her purse my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present 
 
 how about a nice book said ron innocently 
 
 no i think so said hermione composedly i really want an owl i mean got hedwig and got errol 
 
 i said ron a family owl all got is scabbers he pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i think egypt agreed with him 
 
 scabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskers 
 
 a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owl 
 
 so they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menagerie 
 
 there much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cages it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cages 
 
 a pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tails 
 
 the newt wizard left and ron approached the counter 
 
 my rat he told the witch been a bit ever since i brought him back from egypt 
 
 bang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket 
 
 ron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took 
 
 like nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegone 
 
 hm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this rat 
 
 dunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brother 
 
 what powers does he have said the witch examining scabbers closely 
 
 er the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the eyes moved from tattered left ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudly 
 
 been through the mill this one she said 
 
 he was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensively 
 
 an ordinary common or garden rat like this be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more you might like one of these 
 
 she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered 
 
 well if you want a replacement you can try this rat tonic said the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle 
 
 okay said ron how much ouch 
 
 ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itself spitting madly at scabbers 
 
 no crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed on the floor and then scampered for the door 
 
 scabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him harry followed 
 
 it took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his head 
 
 what was that 
 
 it was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harry 
 
 hermione 
 
 probably getting her owl 
 
 they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerie as they reached it hermione came out but she carrying an owl her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat 
 
 you bought that monster said ron his mouth hanging open 
 
 gorgeous he said hermione glowing 
 
 that was a matter of opinion thought harry the ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in arms 
 
 hermione that thing nearly scalped me said ron 
 
 he mean to did you crookshanks said hermione 
 
 and what about scabbers said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation he going to get it with that thing around 
 
 that reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours the problem poor crookshanks that witch said been in there for ages no one wanted him 
 
 wonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldron 
 
 they found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophet 
 
 harry he said smiling as he looked up how are you 
 
 fine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with their shopping 
 
 mr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at him 
 
 they still caught him then he asked 
 
 no said mr weasley looking extremely grave pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so far 
 
 would we get a reward if we caught him asked ron be good to get some more money 
 
 be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained not going to be caught by a wizard the azkaban guards get him back you mark my words 
 
 at that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy percy and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginny 
 
 ginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harry how nice to see you 
 
 hello percy said harry trying not to laugh 
 
 i hope well said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayor 
 
 very well thanks 
 
 harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeply simply splendid to see you old boy 
 
 marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing hand in turn absolutely spiffing 
 
 percy scowled 
 
 enough now said mrs weasley 
 
 mum said fred as though only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you 
 
 i said enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose heard our exciting news she pointed to the silver badge on chest second head boy in the family she said swelling with pride 
 
 and last fred muttered under his breath 
 
 i doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they made you two prefects 
 
 what do we want to be prefects for said george looking revolted at the very idea take all the fun out of life 
 
 ginny giggled 
 
 you want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrs weasley 
 
 got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily going up to change for dinner 
 
 he disappeared and george heaved a sigh 
 
 we tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted us 
 
 
 
 dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courses 
 
 we getting to cross tomorrow dad asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding 
 
 the providing a couple of cars said mr weasley 
 
 everyone looked up at him 
 
 why said percy curiously 
 
 because of you perce said george seriously and be little flags on the hoods with hb on them 
 
 for humongous bighead said fred 
 
 everyone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their pudding 
 
 why are the ministry providing cars father percy asked again in a dignified voice 
 
 well as we got one anymore said mr weasley and as i work there doing me a favor 
 
 his voice was casual but harry help noticing that mr ears had gone red just like did when he was under pressure 
 
 good thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage all got between you a nice sight be on the muggle undergroundyou are all packed you 
 
 ron put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a voice dumped them on my bed 
 
 better go and pack properly ron because we have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percy 
 
 after dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going on 
 
 the door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shouting 
 
 it was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing 
 
 i touched it all right ron roared back 
 
 up said harry 
 
 my head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harry 
 
 rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i left it in the bar 
 
 not going anywhere till found my badge yelled percy 
 
 get stuff packed harry said to ron and he went downstairs 
 
 harry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very dark when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrs weasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door 
 
 makes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedly got a right to know tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child thirteen years old and 
 
 arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over him for sake happy not knowing 
 
 i want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guard retorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus picked him up prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found him 
 
 but not dead fine so the point 
 
 molly they say sirius mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and supposed to be impossible been three weeks and no seen hide nor hair of him and i care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet no nearer catching black than inventing wands the only thing we know for sure is what after 
 
 but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts 
 
 we thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwarts 
 
 but no really sure that after harry 
 
 there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the table 
 
 molly how many times do i have to tell you they report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words at at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring back to power black lost everything the night harry stopped and had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that 
 
 there was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear more 
 
 well arthur you must do what you think is right but forgetting albus dumbledore i think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while headmaster i suppose he knows about all this 
 
 of course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he happy about it but he agreed 
 
 not happy why he be happy if there to catch black 
 
 dumbledore fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavily nor am i if it comes to thatbut when dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those rather avoid 
 
 if they save harry 
 
 c then i will never say another word against them said mr weasley wearily late molly better go up 
 
 harry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairs 
 
 the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottle 
 
 fred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and room in search of his badge 
 
 got it fred whispered to harry been improving it 
 
 the badge now read bighead boy 
 
 harry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed 
 
 so sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive made harry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the train 
 
 harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be people always say that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid of surely black as man would be just as frightened of him 
 
 and then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking about they seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school chances of getting inside seemed very remote 
 
 no all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in fact harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed 
 
 he scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he look after himself escaped lord voldemort three times he completely useless 
 
 unbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is coming 
 
 not going to be murdered harry said out loud 
 
 the spirit dear said his mirror sleepily 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban

 it took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle world 
 
 harry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a shopping wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today warlocks raucous dwarfs and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woolen balaclava 
 
 after breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wall 
 
 harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases a lunascope old boy no more messing around with moon charts see or else discussing the case of sirius black personally i let any of the children out alone until back in azkaban harry have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an hour

 curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life 
 
 just come out prototype a wizard was telling his companion 
 
 the fastest broom in the world it dad squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his arm 
 
 irish international just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and favorites for the world cup 
 
 a large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broom 
 
 the firebolt 
 this racing broom sports a superfine handle of ash treated with a polish and with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision the firebolt has an acceleration of miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on request 
 price on requestharry like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nimbus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already harry ask for the price but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the firebolt 
 
 there were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divination 
 
 harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively 
 
 harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet

 they were there both of them sitting outside florean ice cream parlor ron looking incredibly freckly hermione very brown both waving frantically at him 
 
 finally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam and 
 
 i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew staying at the leaky cauldron 
 
 dad said ron simply 
 
 mr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt marge 
 
 did you really blow up your aunt harry said hermione in a very serious voice 
 
 i mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just lost control 
 
 not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly amazed harry expelled 
 
 so am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad know why fudge let me off does he 
 
 probably cause you it shrugged ron still chuckling famous harry potter and all that hate to see what the do to me if i blew up an aunt mind you have to dig me up first because mum killed me anyway you can ask dad yourself this evening staying at the leaky cauldron tonight too so you can come to cross with us tomorrow there as well 
 
 hermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts things 
 
 excellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stuff 
 
 look at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn and got all our books he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two 
 
 all that hermione harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her 
 
 well taking more new subjects than you i said hermione those are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination the study of ancient runes muggle studies 
 
 what are you doing muggle studies for said ron rolling his eyes at harry your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about muggles 
 
 but be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestly 
 
 are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored them 
 
 still got ten galleons she said checking her purse my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present 
 
 how about a nice book said ron innocently 
 
 no i think so said hermione composedly i really want an owl i mean got hedwig and got errol 
 
 i said ron a family owl all got is scabbers he pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i think egypt agreed with him 
 
 scabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskers 
 
 a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owl 
 
 so they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menagerie 
 
 there much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cages it was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cages 
 
 a pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tails 
 
 the newt wizard left and ron approached the counter 
 
 my rat he told the witch been a bit ever since i brought him back from egypt 
 
 bang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket 
 
 ron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took 
 
 like nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegone 
 
 hm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this rat 
 
 dunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brother 
 
 what powers does he have said the witch examining scabbers closely 
 
 er the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the eyes moved from tattered left ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudly 
 
 been through the mill this one she said 
 
 he was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensively 
 
 an ordinary common or garden rat like this be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more you might like one of these 
 
 she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered 
 
 well if you want a replacement you can try this rat tonic said the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle 
 
 okay said ron how much ouch 
 
 ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itself spitting madly at scabbers 
 
 no crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed on the floor and then scampered for the door 
 
 scabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him harry followed 
 
 it took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his head 
 
 what was that 
 
 it was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harry 
 
 hermione 
 
 probably getting her owl 
 
 they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerie as they reached it hermione came out but she carrying an owl her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat 
 
 you bought that monster said ron his mouth hanging open 
 
 gorgeous he said hermione glowing 
 
 that was a matter of opinion thought harry the ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in arms 
 
 hermione that thing nearly scalped me said ron 
 
 he mean to did you crookshanks said hermione 
 
 and what about scabbers said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation he going to get it with that thing around 
 
 that reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours the problem poor crookshanks that witch said been in there for ages no one wanted him 
 
 wonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldron 
 
 they found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophet 
 
 harry he said smiling as he looked up how are you 
 
 fine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with their shopping 
 
 mr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at him 
 
 they still caught him then he asked 
 
 no said mr weasley looking extremely grave pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so far 
 
 would we get a reward if we caught him asked ron be good to get some more money 
 
 be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained not going to be caught by a wizard the azkaban guards get him back you mark my words 
 
 at that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy percy and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginny 
 
 ginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harry how nice to see you 
 
 hello percy said harry trying not to laugh 
 
 i hope well said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayor 
 
 very well thanks 
 
 harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeply simply splendid to see you old boy 
 
 marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing hand in turn absolutely spiffing 
 
 percy scowled 
 
 enough now said mrs weasley 
 
 mum said fred as though only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you 
 
 i said enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose heard our exciting news she pointed to the silver badge on chest second head boy in the family she said swelling with pride 
 
 and last fred muttered under his breath 
 
 i doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they made you two prefects 
 
 what do we want to be prefects for said george looking revolted at the very idea take all the fun out of life 
 
 ginny giggled 
 
 you want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrs weasley 
 
 got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily going up to change for dinner 
 
 he disappeared and george heaved a sigh 
 
 we tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted us 
 
 
 
 dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courses 
 
 we getting to cross tomorrow dad asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding 
 
 the providing a couple of cars said mr weasley 
 
 everyone looked up at him 
 
 why said percy curiously 
 
 because of you perce said george seriously and be little flags on the hoods with hb on them 
 
 for humongous bighead said fred 
 
 everyone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their pudding 
 
 why are the ministry providing cars father percy asked again in a dignified voice 
 
 well as we got one anymore said mr weasley and as i work there doing me a favor 
 
 his voice was casual but harry help noticing that mr ears had gone red just like did when he was under pressure 
 
 good thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage all got between you a nice sight be on the muggle undergroundyou are all packed you 
 
 ron put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a voice dumped them on my bed 
 
 better go and pack properly ron because we have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percy 
 
 after dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going on 
 
 the door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shouting 
 
 it was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing 
 
 i touched it all right ron roared back 
 
 up said harry 
 
 my head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harry 
 
 rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i left it in the bar 
 
 not going anywhere till found my badge yelled percy 
 
 get stuff packed harry said to ron and he went downstairs 
 
 harry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very dark when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrs weasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door 
 
 makes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedly got a right to know tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child thirteen years old and 
 
 arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over him for sake happy not knowing 
 
 i want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guard retorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus picked him up prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found him 
 
 but not dead fine so the point 
 
 molly they say sirius mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and supposed to be impossible been three weeks and no seen hide nor hair of him and i care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet no nearer catching black than inventing wands the only thing we know for sure is what after 
 
 but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwarts 
 
 we thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwarts 
 
 but no really sure that after harry 
 
 there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the table 
 
 molly how many times do i have to tell you they report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words at at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring back to power black lost everything the night harry stopped and had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on that 
 
 there was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear more 
 
 well arthur you must do what you think is right but forgetting albus dumbledore i think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while headmaster i suppose he knows about all this 
 
 of course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he happy about it but he agreed 
 
 not happy why he be happy if there to catch black 
 
 dumbledore fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavily nor am i if it comes to thatbut when dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those rather avoid 
 
 if they save harry 
 
 c then i will never say another word against them said mr weasley wearily late molly better go up 
 
 harry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairs 
 
 the bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottle 
 
 fred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and room in search of his badge 
 
 got it fred whispered to harry been improving it 
 
 the badge now read bighead boy 
 
 harry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed 
 
 so sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive made harry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the train 
 
 harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be people always say that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid of surely black as man would be just as frightened of him 
 
 and then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking about they seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school chances of getting inside seemed very remote 
 
 no all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in fact harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed 
 
 he scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he look after himself escaped lord voldemort three times he completely useless 
 
 unbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is coming 
 
 not going to be murdered harry said out loud 
 
 the spirit dear said his mirror sleepily 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter four back to the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by twelve the next day school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwarts 
 
 the atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense the imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the dursleys uptight and irritable uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasleys would be arriving at five the very next day 
 
 i hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once seen the sort of stuff your lot wear better have the decency to put on normal clothes all 
 
 harry felt a slight sense of foreboding he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness harry bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards 
 
 uncle vernon had put on his best suit to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london it altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy 
 
 lunch was an almost silent meal dudley even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery aunt petunia eating anything at all her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry 
 
 be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table 
 
 er said harry 
 
 he thought of that how were the weasleys going to pick him up they have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today 
 
 i think so said harry 
 
 uncle vernon snorted into his mustache normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari 
 
 harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room 
 
 aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom harry take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves 
 
 but five came and then went uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly 
 
 late he snarled at harry 
 
 i know said harry maybe er the bad or something 
 
 ten past fivethen a quarter past fiveharry was starting to feel anxious himself now at half past he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room 
 
 no consideration at all 
 
 we had an engagement 
 
 maybe they think get invited to dinner if late 
 
 well they most certainly be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room take the boy and go be no hanging around if coming at all probably mistaken the day i daresay their kind set much store by punctuality either that or they drive some car broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh 
 
 harry jumped up from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling across the room next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified 
 
 what happened said harry the matter 
 
 but dudley seem able to speak hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen harry hurried into the living room 
 
 loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it 
 
 what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire what is it vernon 
 
 but they were left in doubt barely a second longer voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace 
 
 ouch fred no go back go back been some kind of mistake tell george not to ouch george no no room go back quickly and tell ron 
 
 maybe harry can hear us dad maybe be able to let us out 
 
 there was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire 
 
 harry harry can you hear us 
 
 the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines 
 
 what is this growled uncle vernon going on 
 
 they tried to get here by floo powder said harry fighting a mad desire to laugh they can travel by fire only blocked the fireplace hang on 
 
 he approached the fireplace and called through the boards 
 
 mr weasley can you hear me 
 
 the hammering stopped somebody inside the chimney piece said shh 
 
 mr weasley harrythe fireplace has been blocked up you be able to get through there 
 
 damn said mr voice what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for 
 
 got an electric fire harry explained 
 
 really said mr voice excitedly eclectic you say with a plug gracious i must see thinkouch ron 
 
 voice now joined the others 
 
 what are we doing here has something gone wrong 
 
 oh no ron came voice very sarcastically no this is exactly where we wanted to end up 
 
 yeah having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall 
 
 boys boys said mr weasley vaguely trying to think what to waystand back harry 
 
 harry retreated to the sofa uncle vernon however moved forward 
 
 wait a moment he bellowed at the fire what exactly are you going to 
 
 bang 
 
 the electric fire shot across the room as the fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle 
 
 better panted mr weasley brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses ah you must be aunt and uncle 
 
 tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia words utterly failed uncle vernon his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years 
 
 er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace all my fault it just occur to me that we be able to get out at the other end i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry muggle fireplaces supposed to be connected strictly speaking but got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me i can put it right in a jiffy though worry light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate 
 
 harry was ready to bet that the dursleys understood a single word of this they were still gaping at mr weasley thunderstruck aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernon 
 
 hello harry said mr weasley brightly got your trunk ready 
 
 upstairs said harry grinning back 
 
 get it said fred at once winking at harry he and george left the room they knew where bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry 
 
 well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence very erm very nice place got here 
 
 as the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick this remark go down too well with the dursleys uncle face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again however they seemed too scared to actually say anything 
 
 mr weasley was looking around he loved everything to do with muggles harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder 
 
 they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably ah yes i can see the plugs i collect plugs he added to uncle vernon and batteries got a very large collection of batteries my wife thinks mad but there you are 
 
 uncle vernon clearly thought mr weasley was mad too he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack 
 
 dudley suddenly reappeared in the room harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father unfortunately uncle bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley 
 
 ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation 
 
 yep said harry dudley 
 
 he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at peculiar behavior indeed from the tone of his voice when he next spoke harry was quite sure that mr weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was except that mr weasley felt sympathy rather than fear 
 
 having a good holiday dudley he said kindly 
 
 dudley whimpered harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside 
 
 fred and george came back into the room carrying school trunk they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley their faces cracked into identical evil grins 
 
 ah right said mr weasley better get cracking then 
 
 he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one 
 
 incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him 
 
 flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever 
 
 off you go then fred said mr weasley 
 
 coming said fred oh no hang on 
 
 a bag of sweets had spilled out of pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers 
 
 fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished 
 
 right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk 
 
 harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too 
 
 ron you next said mr weasley 
 
 see you said ron brightly to the dursleys he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared 
 
 now harry and mr weasley alone remained 
 
 then harry said to the dursleys 
 
 they say anything at all harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back he was looking at the dursleys in amazement 
 
 harry said to you he said you hear him 
 
 it matter harry muttered to mr weasley honestly i care 
 
 mr weasley did not remove his hand from shoulder 
 
 you going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation surely going to say 
 
 uncle face worked furiously the idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering but mr wand was still in his hand and uncle tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully then 
 
 see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream 
 
 harry wheeled around dudley was no longer standing behind his parents he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth one bewildered second later harry realized that the thing was tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him 
 
 aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard 
 
 not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley 
 
 no really said mr weasley desperately a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it 
 
 but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace 
 
 now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand trying to help 
 
 bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament 
 
 harry go just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon sort this out 
 
 harry want to miss the fun but uncle second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley he stepped into the fire looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle hand with his wand aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley and tongue lolling around like a great slimy python but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of flames 
 
 rowling

 harry felt a slight sense of foreboding he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness harry bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards 
 
 uncle vernon had put on his best suit to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london it altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemy 
 
 lunch was an almost silent meal dudley even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery aunt petunia eating anything at all her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harry 
 
 be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the table 
 
 er said harry 
 
 he thought of that how were the weasleys going to pick him up they have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same today 
 
 i think so said harry 
 
 uncle vernon snorted into his mustache normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrari 
 
 harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living room 
 
 aunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom harry take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves 
 
 but five came and then went uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quickly 
 
 late he snarled at harry 
 
 i know said harry maybe er the bad or something 
 
 ten past fivethen a quarter past fiveharry was starting to feel anxious himself now at half past he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room 
 
 no consideration at all 
 
 we had an engagement 
 
 maybe they think get invited to dinner if late 
 
 well they most certainly be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room take the boy and go be no hanging around if coming at all probably mistaken the day i daresay their kind set much store by punctuality either that or they drive some car broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrgh 
 
 harry jumped up from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling across the room next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrified 
 
 what happened said harry the matter 
 
 but dudley seem able to speak hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen harry hurried into the living room 
 
 loud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it 
 
 what is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire what is it vernon 
 
 but they were left in doubt barely a second longer voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace 
 
 ouch fred no go back go back been some kind of mistake tell george not to ouch george no no room go back quickly and tell ron 
 
 maybe harry can hear us dad maybe be able to let us out 
 
 there was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire 
 
 harry harry can you hear us 
 
 the dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverines 
 
 what is this growled uncle vernon going on 
 
 they tried to get here by floo powder said harry fighting a mad desire to laugh they can travel by fire only blocked the fireplace hang on 
 
 he approached the fireplace and called through the boards 
 
 mr weasley can you hear me 
 
 the hammering stopped somebody inside the chimney piece said shh 
 
 mr weasley harrythe fireplace has been blocked up you be able to get through there 
 
 damn said mr voice what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for 
 
 got an electric fire harry explained 
 
 really said mr voice excitedly eclectic you say with a plug gracious i must see thinkouch ron 
 
 voice now joined the others 
 
 what are we doing here has something gone wrong 
 
 oh no ron came voice very sarcastically no this is exactly where we wanted to end up 
 
 yeah having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wall 
 
 boys boys said mr weasley vaguely trying to think what to waystand back harry 
 
 harry retreated to the sofa uncle vernon however moved forward 
 
 wait a moment he bellowed at the fire what exactly are you going to 
 
 bang 
 
 the electric fire shot across the room as the fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last freckle 
 
 better panted mr weasley brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses ah you must be aunt and uncle 
 
 tall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia words utterly failed uncle vernon his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years 
 
 er yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace all my fault it just occur to me that we be able to get out at the other end i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry muggle fireplaces supposed to be connected strictly speaking but got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me i can put it right in a jiffy though worry light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparate 
 
 harry was ready to bet that the dursleys understood a single word of this they were still gaping at mr weasley thunderstruck aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernon 
 
 hello harry said mr weasley brightly got your trunk ready 
 
 upstairs said harry grinning back 
 
 get it said fred at once winking at harry he and george left the room they knew where bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harry 
 
 well said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence very erm very nice place got here 
 
 as the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick this remark go down too well with the dursleys uncle face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again however they seemed too scared to actually say anything 
 
 mr weasley was looking around he loved everything to do with muggles harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder 
 
 they run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably ah yes i can see the plugs i collect plugs he added to uncle vernon and batteries got a very large collection of batteries my wife thinks mad but there you are 
 
 uncle vernon clearly thought mr weasley was mad too he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attack 
 
 dudley suddenly reappeared in the room harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father unfortunately uncle bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudley 
 
 ah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversation 
 
 yep said harry dudley 
 
 he and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at peculiar behavior indeed from the tone of his voice when he next spoke harry was quite sure that mr weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was except that mr weasley felt sympathy rather than fear 
 
 having a good holiday dudley he said kindly 
 
 dudley whimpered harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside 
 
 fred and george came back into the room carrying school trunk they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley their faces cracked into identical evil grins 
 
 ah right said mr weasley better get cracking then 
 
 he pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as one 
 
 incendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him 
 
 flames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever 
 
 off you go then fred said mr weasley 
 
 coming said fred oh no hang on 
 
 a bag of sweets had spilled out of pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers 
 
 fred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp there was a whooshing sound and fred vanished 
 
 right then george said mr weasley you and the trunk 
 
 harry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished too 
 
 ron you next said mr weasley 
 
 see you said ron brightly to the dursleys he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappeared 
 
 now harry and mr weasley alone remained 
 
 then harry said to the dursleys 
 
 they say anything at all harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back he was looking at the dursleys in amazement 
 
 harry said to you he said you hear him 
 
 it matter harry muttered to mr weasley honestly i care 
 
 mr weasley did not remove his hand from shoulder 
 
 you going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation surely going to say 
 
 uncle face worked furiously the idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering but mr wand was still in his hand and uncle tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully then 
 
 see you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to scream 
 
 harry wheeled around dudley was no longer standing behind his parents he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth one bewildered second later harry realized that the thing was tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him 
 
 aunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heard 
 
 not to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasley 
 
 no really said mr weasley desperately a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it 
 
 but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace 
 
 now really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand trying to help 
 
 bellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornament 
 
 harry go just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon sort this out 
 
 harry want to miss the fun but uncle second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley he stepped into the fire looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle hand with his wand aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley and tongue lolling around like a great slimy python but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of flames 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter four number twelve grimmauld placecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the order of the harry began 
 
 not here boy snarled moody wait till inside 
 
 he pulled the piece of parchment out of hand and set fire to it with his as the message curled into flames and floated to the ground harry looked around at the houses again they were standing outside number eleven he looked to the left and saw number ten to the right however was number thirteen 
 
 but 
 
 think about what just memorised said lupin quietly 
 
 harry thought and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve grimmauld place than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows it was as though an extra house had inflated pushing those on either side out of its way harry gaped at it the stereo in number eleven thudded on apparently the muggles inside felt anything 
 
 come on hurry growled moody prodding harry in the back 
 
 harry walked up the worn stone steps staring at the newly materialised door its black paint was shabby and scratched the silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent there was no keyhole or letterbox 
 
 lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once harry heard many loud metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain the door creaked open 
 
 get in quick harry lupin whispered but go far inside and touch anything 
 
 harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall he could smell damp dust and a sweetish rotting smell the place had the feeling of a derelict building he looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him lupin and tonks carrying his trunk and cage moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the had stolen from the streetlamps they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before moody limped inside and closed the front door so that the darkness in the hall became complete 
 
 here 
 
 he rapped harry hard over the head with his wand harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the disillusionment charm must have lifted 
 
 now stay still everyone while i give us a bit of light in here moody whispered 
 
 the others hushed voices were giving harry an odd feeling of foreboding it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person he heard a soft hissing noise and then gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long gloomy hallway where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and portraits hung crooked on the walls harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents 
 
 there were hurried footsteps and mother mrs weasley emerged from a door at the far end of the hall she was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them though harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her 
 
 oh harry lovely to see you she whispered pulling him into a hug before holding him at length and examining him critically looking peaky you need feeding up but have to wait a bit for dinner afraid 
 
 she turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently just arrived the started 
 
 the wizards behind harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which mrs weasley had just come harry made to follow lupin but mrs weasley held him back 
 
 no harry the only for members of the order ron and hermione are upstairs you can wait with them until the meetings over then have dinner and keep your voice down in the hall she added in an urgent whisper 
 
 why 
 
 i want anything to wake up 
 
 what 
 
 explain later got to hurry supposed to be at the meeting just show you where sleeping 
 
 pressing her finger to her lips she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long curtains behind which harry supposed there must be another door and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed leg they started up the dark staircase passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall a closer look showed harry that the heads belonged to all of them had the same rather nose 
 
 bewilderment deepened with every step he took what on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of wizards 
 
 mrs weasley why 
 
 ron and hermione will explain everything dear really got to dash mrs weasley whispered distractedly had reached the second the door on the right call you when over 
 
 and she hurried off downstairs again 
 
 harry crossed the dingy landing turned the bedroom doorknob which was shaped like a head and opened the door 
 
 he caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy room then there was a loud twittering noise followed by an even louder shriek and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat while tiny owl pigwidgeon zoomed excitedly round and round their heads 
 
 harry ron here here we hear you arrive oh how are you are you all right have you been furious with us i bet you have i know our letters were uselessbut we tell you anything dumbledore made us swear we oh got so much to tell you and got things to tell usthe dementors when we heardand that ministry just outrageous looked it all up they expel you they just provision in the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery for the use of magic in situations 
 
 let him breathe hermione said ron grinning as he closed the door behind harry he seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart making him taller and more gangly looking than ever though the long nose bright red hair and freckles were the same 
 
 still beaming hermione let go of harry but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on shoulder 
 
 hedwig 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as harry stroked her feathers 
 
 been in a right state said ron pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters look at this 
 
 he showed harry the index finger of his right hand which sported a but clearly deep cut 
 
 oh yeah harry said sorry about that but i wanted answers you know 
 
 we wanted to give them to you mate said ron hermione was going spare she kept saying do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news but dumbledore made us 
 
 swear not to tell me said harry yeah already said 
 
 the warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach all of a suddenafter yearning to see them for a solid monthhe felt he would rather ron and hermione left him alone 
 
 there was a strained silence in which harry stroked hedwig automatically not looking at either of the others 
 
 he seemed to think it was best said hermione rather breathlessly dumbledore i mean 
 
 right said harry he noticed that her hands too bore the marks of beak and found that he was not at all sorry 
 
 i think he thought you were safest with the muggles ron began 
 
 yeah said harry raising his eyebrows have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer 
 
 well nobut why had people from the order of the phoenix tailing you all the time 
 
 harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs so everyone had known he was being followed except him 
 
 work that well though did it said harry doing his utmost to keep his voice even had to look after myself after all i 
 
 he was so angry said hermione in an almost awestruck voice dumbledore we saw him when he found out mundungus had left before his shift had ended he was scary 
 
 well glad he left harry said coldly if he i have done magic and dumbledore would probably have left me at privet drive all summer 
 
 you you worried about the ministry of magic hearing said hermione quietly 
 
 no harry lied defiantly he walked away from them looking around with hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder but this room was not likely to raise his spirits it was dank and dark a blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as harry passed it he thought he heard someone who was lurking out of sight snigger 
 
 so dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark harry asked still trying hard to keep his voice casual did youerbother to ask him at all 
 
 he glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would it did nothing to improve his temper 
 
 we told dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on said ron we did mate but really busy now only seen him twice since we came here and he have much time he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote he said the owls might be intercepted 
 
 he could kept me informed if wanted to harry said shortly not telling me he know ways to send messages without owls 
 
 hermione glanced at ron and then said i thought that too but he want you to know anything 
 
 maybe he thinks i be trusted said harry watching their expressions 
 
 be thick said ron looking highly disconcerted 
 
 or that i take care of myself 
 
 of course he think that said hermione anxiously 
 
 so how come i have to stay at the dursleys while you two get to join in everything going on here said harry the words tumbling over one another in a rush his voice growing louder with every word how come you two are allowed to know everything going on 
 
 not ron interrupted mum let us near the meetings she says too young 
 
 but before he knew it harry was shouting 
 
 so you been in the meetings big deal still been here you still been together me been stuck at the dursleys for a month and handled more than you ever managed and dumbledore knows it who saved the stone who got rid of riddle who saved both your skins from the dementors 
 
 every bitter and resentful thought harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him his frustration at the lack of news the hurt that they had all been together without him his fury at being followed and not told about it all the feelings he was of finally burst their boundaries hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads 
 
 who had to get past dragons and sphinxes and every other foul thing last year who saw him come back who had to escape from him me 
 
 ron was standing there with his mouth clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say whilst hermione looked on the verge of tears 
 
 but why should i know going on why should anyone bother to tell me been happening 
 
 harry we wanted to tell you we really did hermione began 
 
 wanted to that much can you or have sent me an owl but dumbledore made you swear 
 
 well he did 
 
 four weeks been stuck in privet drive nicking papers out of bins to try and find out been going on 
 
 we wanted to 
 
 i suppose been having a real laugh you all holed up here together 
 
 no honest 
 
 harry really sorry said hermione desperately her eyes now sparkling with tears absolutely right harry be furious if it was me 
 
 harry glared at her still breathing deeply then turned away from them again pacing up and down hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe there was a long pause broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below feet 
 
 what is this place anyway he shot at ron and hermione 
 
 headquarters of the order of the phoenix said ron at once 
 
 is anyone going to bother telling me what the order of the phoenix 
 
 a secret society said hermione quickly in charge he founded it the people who fought against last time 
 
 in it said harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets 
 
 quite a few people 
 
 met about twenty of them said ron but we think there are more 
 
 harry glared at them 
 
 well he demanded looking from one to the other 
 
 er said ron well what 
 
 voldemort said harry furiously and both ron and hermione winced happening he up to where is he what are we doing to stop him 
 
 told you the order let us in on their meetings said hermione nervously so we know the detailsbut got a general idea she added hastily seeing the look on face 
 
 fred and george have invented extendable ears see said ron really useful 
 
 extendable 
 
 ears yeah only had to stop using them lately because mum found out and went berserk fred and george had to hide them all to stop mum binning them but we got a good bit of use out of them before mum realised what was going on we know some of the order are following known death eaters keeping tabs on them you know 
 
 some of them are working on recruiting more people to the order said hermione 
 
 and some of them are standing guard over something said ron always talking about guard duty 
 
 have been me could it said harry sarcastically 
 
 oh yeah said ron with a look of dawning comprehension 
 
 harry snorted he walked around the room again looking anywhere but at ron and hermione so what have you two been doing if not allowed in meetings he demanded you said been busy 
 
 we have said hermione quickly been decontaminating this house been empty for ages and been breeding in here managed to clean out the kitchen most of the bedrooms and i think doing the drawing room tomoaargh 
 
 with two loud cracks fred and george elder twin brothers had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join hedwig on top of the wardrobe 
 
 stop doing that hermione said weakly to the twins who were as vividly as ron though stockier and slightly shorter 
 
 hello harry said george beaming at him we thought we heard your dulcet tones 
 
 you want to bottle up your anger like that harry let it all out said fred also beaming there might be a couple of people fifty miles away who hear you 
 
 you two passed your apparation tests then asked harry grumpily 
 
 with distinction said fred who was holding what looked like a piece of very long string 
 
 it would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs said ron 
 
 time is galleons little brother said fred anyway harry interfering with reception extendable ears he added in response to raised eyebrows and held up the string which harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing trying to hear going on downstairs 
 
 you want to be careful said ron staring at the ear if mum sees one of them again 
 
 worth the risk a major meeting having said fred 
 
 the door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared 
 
 oh hello harry said younger sister ginny brightly i thought i heard your voice 
 
 turning to fred and george she said with the extendable ears gone and put an imperturbable charm on the kitchen door 
 
 how know said george looking crestfallen 
 
 tonks told me how to find out said ginny you just chuck stuff at the door and if it make contact the been imperturbed been flicking dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it so no way the extendable ears will be able to get under the gap 
 
 fred heaved a deep sigh 
 
 shame i really fancied finding out what old been up to 
 
 snape said harry quickly is he here 
 
 yeah said george carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds fred and ginny followed giving a report top secret 
 
 git said fred idly 
 
 on our side now said hermione reprovingly 
 
 ron snorted stop him being a git the way he looks at us when he sees us 
 
 bill like him either said ginny as though that settled the matter 
 
 harry was not sure his anger had abated yet but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting he sank on to the bed opposite the others 
 
 is bill here he asked i thought he was working in egypt 
 
 he applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the order said fred he says he misses the tombs but he smirked there are compensations 
 
 what mean 
 
 remember old fleur delacour said george got a job at gringotts to eemprove er eeenglish 
 
 and been giving her a lot of private lessons sniggered fred 
 
 in the order too said george but still in romania dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible so trying to make contacts on his days off 
 
 percy do that harry asked the last he had heard the third weasley brother was working in the department of international magical at the ministry of magic 
 
 at words all the weasleys and hermione exchanged darkly significant looks 
 
 whatever you do mention percy in front of mum and dad ron told harry in a tense voice 
 
 why not 
 
 because every time mentioned dad breaks whatever holding and mum starts crying fred said 
 
 been awful said ginny sadly 
 
 i think well shot of him said george with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face 
 
 happened harry said 
 
 percy and dad had a row said fred never seen dad row with anyone like that normally mum who shouts 
 
 it was the first week back after term ended said ron we were about to come and join the order percy came home and told us been promoted 
 
 kidding said harry 
 
 though he knew perfectly well that percy was highly ambitious impression was that percy had not made a great success of his first job at the ministry of magic percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by lord voldemort not that the ministry had believed itthey all thought mr crouch had gone mad 
 
 yeah we were all surprised said george because percy got into a load of trouble about crouch there was an inquiry and everything they said percy ought to have realised crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior but you know percy crouch left him in charge he going to complain 
 
 so how come they promoted him 
 
 exactly what we wondered said ron who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that harry had stopped yelling he came home really pleased with himselfeven more pleased than usual if you can imagine thatand told dad been offered a position in own office a really good one for someone only a year out of hogwartsjunior assistant to the minister he expected dad to be all impressed i think 
 
 only dad said fred grimly 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 well apparently fudge has been storming round the ministry checking that having any contact with dumbledore said george 
 
 name is mud with the ministry these days see said fred they all think just making trouble saying back 
 
 dad says fudge has made it clear that anyone in league with dumbledore can clear out their desks said george 
 
 trouble is fudge suspects dad he knows friendly with dumbledore and always thought a bit of a weirdo because of his muggle obsession 
 
 but that got to do with percy asked harry confused 
 
 coming to that dad reckons fudge only wants percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the familyand dumbledore 
 
 harry let out a low whistle 
 
 bet percy loved that 
 
 ron laughed in a hollow sort of way 
 
 he went completely berserk he saidwell he said loads of terrible stuff he said been having to struggle against lousy reputation ever since he joined the ministry and that got no ambition and why always beenyou knownot had a lot of money i mean 
 
 what said harry in disbelief as ginny made a noise like an angry cat 
 
 i know said ron in a low voice and it got worse he said dad was an idiot to run around with dumbledore that dumbledore was heading for big trouble and dad was going to go down with him and that hepercyknew where his loyalty lay and it was with the ministry and if mum and dad were going to become traitors to the ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he belong to our family any more and he packed his bags the same night and left living here in london now 
 
 harry swore under his breath he had always liked percy least of brothers but he had never imagined he would say such things to mr weasley 
 
 been in a right state said ron dully you knowcrying and stuff she came up to london to try and talk to percy but he slammed the door in her face i dunno what he does if he meets dad at workignores him i 
 
 but percy must know back said harry slowly not stupid he must know your mum and dad risk everything without proof 
 
 yeah well your name got dragged into the row said ron shooting harry a furtive look percy said the only evidence was your word and i dunno he think it was good enough 
 
 percy takes the daily prophet seriously said hermione tartly and the others all nodded 
 
 what are you talking about harry asked looking around at them all they were all regarding him warily 
 
 you been getting the daily prophet hermione asked nervously 
 
 yeah i have said harry 
 
 have youer been reading it thoroughly hermione asked still more anxiously 
 
 not cover to cover said harry defensively if they were going to report anything about voldemort it would be headline news it 
 
 the others flinched at the sound of the name hermione hurried on well need to read it cover to cover to pick it up but theyumthey mention you a couple of times a week 
 
 but have seen 
 
 not if only been reading the front page you said hermione shaking her head not talking about big articles they just slip you in like a standing joke 
 
 what 
 
 quite nasty actually said hermione in a voice of forced calm just building on stuff 
 
 but not writing for them any more is she 
 
 oh no kept her promisenot that got any choice hermione added with satisfaction but she laid the foundation for what trying to do now 
 
 which is what said harry impatiently 
 
 ok you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that 
 
 yeah said harry who was not likely to forget rita stories about him in a hurry 
 
 well writing about you as though this deluded person who thinks a great tragic hero or something said hermione very fast as though it would be less unpleasant for harry to hear these facts quickly they keep slipping in snide comments about you if some story appears they say something like a tale worthy of harry potter and if anyone has a funny accident or anything hope he got a scar on his forehead or be asked to worship him next 
 
 i want anyone to worship harry began hotly 
 
 i know you said hermione quickly looking frightened i know harry but you see what doing they want to turn you into someone nobody will believe fudge is behind it bet anything they want wizards on the street to think just some stupid boy a bit of a joke who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going 
 
 i ask i want voldemort killed my parents harry spluttered i got famous because he murdered my family but kill me who wants to be famous for that they think rather never 
 
 we know harry said ginny earnestly 
 
 and of course they report a word about the dementors attacking you said hermione told them to keep that quiet that been a really big story dementors they even reported that you broke the international statute of secrecy we thought they would it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid we think biding their time until expelled then really going to go to town i mean if expelled obviously she went on hastily you really be not if they abide by their own laws no case against you 
 
 they were back on the hearing and harry did not want to think about that he cast around for another change of subject but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs 
 
 uh oh 
 
 fred gave the extendable ear a hearty tug there was another loud crack and he and george vanished seconds later mrs weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway 
 
 the over you can come down and have dinner now dying to see you harry and left all those dungbombs outside the kitchen door 
 
 crookshanks said ginny unblushingly he loves playing with them 
 
 oh said mrs weasley i thought it might have been kreacher he keeps doing odd things like that now forget to keep your voices down in the hall ginny your hands are filthy what have you been doing go and wash them before dinner please 
 
 ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room leaving harry alone with ron and hermione both of them were watching him apprehensively as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone the sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed 
 
 look he muttered but ron shook his head and hermione said quietly we knew be angry harry we really blame you but got to understand we did try to persuade dumbledore 
 
 yeah i know said harry grudgingly 
 
 he cast around for a topic that involve his headmaster because the very thought of dumbledore made insides burn with anger again 
 
 kreacher he asked 
 
 the who lives here said ron nutter never met one like him 
 
 hermione frowned at ron 
 
 not a nutter ron 
 
 his ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother said ron irritably is that normal hermione 
 
 wellwell if he is a bit strange not his fault 
 
 ron rolled his eyes at harry 
 
 hermione still given up on spew 
 
 not spew said hermione heatedly the society for the promotion of elfish welfare and not just me dumbledore says we should be kind to kreacher too 
 
 yeah yeah said ron starving 
 
 he led the way out of the door and on to the landing but before they could descend the stairs hold it ron breathed flinging out an arm to stop harry and hermione walking any further still in the hall we might be able to hear something 
 
 the three of them looked cautiously over the banisters the gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards including all of guard they were whispering excitedly together in the very centre of the group harry saw the dark head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at hogwarts professor snape harry leant further over the banisters he was very interested in what snape was doing for the order of the phoenix 
 
 a thin piece of string descended in front of eyes looking up he saw fred and george on the landing above cautiously lowering the extendable ear towards the dark knot of people below a moment later however they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight 
 
 dammit harry heard fred whisper as he hoisted the extendable ear back up again 
 
 they heard the front door open then close 
 
 snape never eats here ron told harry quietly thank god 
 
 and forget to keep your voice down in the hall harry hermione whispered 
 
 as they passed the row of heads on the wall they saw lupin mrs weasley and tonks at the front door magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left 
 
 eating down in the kitchen mrs weasley whispered meeting them at the bottom of the stairs harry dear if just tiptoe across the hall through this door here 
 
 crash 
 
 tonks cried mrs weasley in exasperation turning to look behind her 
 
 sorry wailed tonks who was lying flat on the floor that stupid umbrella stand the second time tripped over 
 
 but the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible screech 
 
 the velvet curtains harry had passed earlier had flown apart but there was no door behind them for a split second harry thought he was looking through a window a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being torturedthen he realised it was simply a portrait but the most realistic and the most unpleasant he had ever seen in his life 
 
 the old woman was drooling her eyes were rolling the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed and all along the hall behind them the other portraits awoke and began to yell too so that harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears 
 
 lupin and mrs weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces 
 
 filth scum of dirt and vileness mutants freaks begone from this place how dare you befoul the house of my fathers 
 
 tonks apologised over and over again dragging the huge heavy leg back off the floor mrs weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall stunning all the other portraits with her wand and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing harry 
 
 shut up you horrible old hag shut up he roared seizing the curtain mrs weasley had abandoned 
 
 the old face blanched 
 
 yoooou she howled her eyes popping at the sight of the man blood traitor abomination shame of my flesh 
 
 i saidshutup roared the man and with a stupendous effort he and lupin managed to force the curtains closed again 
 
 the old screeches died and an echoing silence tell panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes godfather sirius turned to face him 
 
 hello harry he said grimly i see met my mother 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter four number twelve grimmauld placecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the order of the harry began 
 
 not here boy snarled moody wait till inside 
 
 he pulled the piece of parchment out of hand and set fire to it with his as the message curled into flames and floated to the ground harry looked around at the houses again they were standing outside number eleven he looked to the left and saw number ten to the right however was number thirteen 
 
 but 
 
 think about what just memorised said lupin quietly 
 
 harry thought and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve grimmauld place than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows it was as though an extra house had inflated pushing those on either side out of its way harry gaped at it the stereo in number eleven thudded on apparently the muggles inside felt anything 
 
 come on hurry growled moody prodding harry in the back 
 
 harry walked up the worn stone steps staring at the newly materialised door its black paint was shabby and scratched the silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent there was no keyhole or letterbox 
 
 lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once harry heard many loud metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain the door creaked open 
 
 get in quick harry lupin whispered but go far inside and touch anything 
 
 harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall he could smell damp dust and a sweetish rotting smell the place had the feeling of a derelict building he looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him lupin and tonks carrying his trunk and cage moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the had stolen from the streetlamps they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before moody limped inside and closed the front door so that the darkness in the hall became complete 
 
 here 
 
 he rapped harry hard over the head with his wand harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the disillusionment charm must have lifted 
 
 now stay still everyone while i give us a bit of light in here moody whispered 
 
 the others hushed voices were giving harry an odd feeling of foreboding it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person he heard a soft hissing noise and then gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long gloomy hallway where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and portraits hung crooked on the walls harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents 
 
 there were hurried footsteps and mother mrs weasley emerged from a door at the far end of the hall she was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them though harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her 
 
 oh harry lovely to see you she whispered pulling him into a hug before holding him at length and examining him critically looking peaky you need feeding up but have to wait a bit for dinner afraid 
 
 she turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently just arrived the started 
 
 the wizards behind harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which mrs weasley had just come harry made to follow lupin but mrs weasley held him back 
 
 no harry the only for members of the order ron and hermione are upstairs you can wait with them until the meetings over then have dinner and keep your voice down in the hall she added in an urgent whisper 
 
 why 
 
 i want anything to wake up 
 
 what 
 
 explain later got to hurry supposed to be at the meeting just show you where sleeping 
 
 pressing her finger to her lips she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long curtains behind which harry supposed there must be another door and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed leg they started up the dark staircase passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall a closer look showed harry that the heads belonged to all of them had the same rather nose 
 
 bewilderment deepened with every step he took what on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of wizards 
 
 mrs weasley why 
 
 ron and hermione will explain everything dear really got to dash mrs weasley whispered distractedly had reached the second the door on the right call you when over 
 
 and she hurried off downstairs again 
 
 harry crossed the dingy landing turned the bedroom doorknob which was shaped like a head and opened the door 
 
 he caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy room then there was a loud twittering noise followed by an even louder shriek and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat while tiny owl pigwidgeon zoomed excitedly round and round their heads 
 
 harry ron here here we hear you arrive oh how are you are you all right have you been furious with us i bet you have i know our letters were uselessbut we tell you anything dumbledore made us swear we oh got so much to tell you and got things to tell usthe dementors when we heardand that ministry just outrageous looked it all up they expel you they just provision in the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery for the use of magic in situations 
 
 let him breathe hermione said ron grinning as he closed the door behind harry he seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart making him taller and more gangly looking than ever though the long nose bright red hair and freckles were the same 
 
 still beaming hermione let go of harry but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on shoulder 
 
 hedwig 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as harry stroked her feathers 
 
 been in a right state said ron pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters look at this 
 
 he showed harry the index finger of his right hand which sported a but clearly deep cut 
 
 oh yeah harry said sorry about that but i wanted answers you know 
 
 we wanted to give them to you mate said ron hermione was going spare she kept saying do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news but dumbledore made us 
 
 swear not to tell me said harry yeah already said 
 
 the warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach all of a suddenafter yearning to see them for a solid monthhe felt he would rather ron and hermione left him alone 
 
 there was a strained silence in which harry stroked hedwig automatically not looking at either of the others 
 
 he seemed to think it was best said hermione rather breathlessly dumbledore i mean 
 
 right said harry he noticed that her hands too bore the marks of beak and found that he was not at all sorry 
 
 i think he thought you were safest with the muggles ron began 
 
 yeah said harry raising his eyebrows have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer 
 
 well nobut why had people from the order of the phoenix tailing you all the time 
 
 harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs so everyone had known he was being followed except him 
 
 work that well though did it said harry doing his utmost to keep his voice even had to look after myself after all i 
 
 he was so angry said hermione in an almost awestruck voice dumbledore we saw him when he found out mundungus had left before his shift had ended he was scary 
 
 well glad he left harry said coldly if he i have done magic and dumbledore would probably have left me at privet drive all summer 
 
 you you worried about the ministry of magic hearing said hermione quietly 
 
 no harry lied defiantly he walked away from them looking around with hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder but this room was not likely to raise his spirits it was dank and dark a blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as harry passed it he thought he heard someone who was lurking out of sight snigger 
 
 so dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark harry asked still trying hard to keep his voice casual did youerbother to ask him at all 
 
 he glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would it did nothing to improve his temper 
 
 we told dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on said ron we did mate but really busy now only seen him twice since we came here and he have much time he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote he said the owls might be intercepted 
 
 he could kept me informed if wanted to harry said shortly not telling me he know ways to send messages without owls 
 
 hermione glanced at ron and then said i thought that too but he want you to know anything 
 
 maybe he thinks i be trusted said harry watching their expressions 
 
 be thick said ron looking highly disconcerted 
 
 or that i take care of myself 
 
 of course he think that said hermione anxiously 
 
 so how come i have to stay at the dursleys while you two get to join in everything going on here said harry the words tumbling over one another in a rush his voice growing louder with every word how come you two are allowed to know everything going on 
 
 not ron interrupted mum let us near the meetings she says too young 
 
 but before he knew it harry was shouting 
 
 so you been in the meetings big deal still been here you still been together me been stuck at the dursleys for a month and handled more than you ever managed and dumbledore knows it who saved the stone who got rid of riddle who saved both your skins from the dementors 
 
 every bitter and resentful thought harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him his frustration at the lack of news the hurt that they had all been together without him his fury at being followed and not told about it all the feelings he was of finally burst their boundaries hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads 
 
 who had to get past dragons and sphinxes and every other foul thing last year who saw him come back who had to escape from him me 
 
 ron was standing there with his mouth clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say whilst hermione looked on the verge of tears 
 
 but why should i know going on why should anyone bother to tell me been happening 
 
 harry we wanted to tell you we really did hermione began 
 
 wanted to that much can you or have sent me an owl but dumbledore made you swear 
 
 well he did 
 
 four weeks been stuck in privet drive nicking papers out of bins to try and find out been going on 
 
 we wanted to 
 
 i suppose been having a real laugh you all holed up here together 
 
 no honest 
 
 harry really sorry said hermione desperately her eyes now sparkling with tears absolutely right harry be furious if it was me 
 
 harry glared at her still breathing deeply then turned away from them again pacing up and down hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe there was a long pause broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below feet 
 
 what is this place anyway he shot at ron and hermione 
 
 headquarters of the order of the phoenix said ron at once 
 
 is anyone going to bother telling me what the order of the phoenix 
 
 a secret society said hermione quickly in charge he founded it the people who fought against last time 
 
 in it said harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets 
 
 quite a few people 
 
 met about twenty of them said ron but we think there are more 
 
 harry glared at them 
 
 well he demanded looking from one to the other 
 
 er said ron well what 
 
 voldemort said harry furiously and both ron and hermione winced happening he up to where is he what are we doing to stop him 
 
 told you the order let us in on their meetings said hermione nervously so we know the detailsbut got a general idea she added hastily seeing the look on face 
 
 fred and george have invented extendable ears see said ron really useful 
 
 extendable 
 
 ears yeah only had to stop using them lately because mum found out and went berserk fred and george had to hide them all to stop mum binning them but we got a good bit of use out of them before mum realised what was going on we know some of the order are following known death eaters keeping tabs on them you know 
 
 some of them are working on recruiting more people to the order said hermione 
 
 and some of them are standing guard over something said ron always talking about guard duty 
 
 have been me could it said harry sarcastically 
 
 oh yeah said ron with a look of dawning comprehension 
 
 harry snorted he walked around the room again looking anywhere but at ron and hermione so what have you two been doing if not allowed in meetings he demanded you said been busy 
 
 we have said hermione quickly been decontaminating this house been empty for ages and been breeding in here managed to clean out the kitchen most of the bedrooms and i think doing the drawing room tomoaargh 
 
 with two loud cracks fred and george elder twin brothers had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join hedwig on top of the wardrobe 
 
 stop doing that hermione said weakly to the twins who were as vividly as ron though stockier and slightly shorter 
 
 hello harry said george beaming at him we thought we heard your dulcet tones 
 
 you want to bottle up your anger like that harry let it all out said fred also beaming there might be a couple of people fifty miles away who hear you 
 
 you two passed your apparation tests then asked harry grumpily 
 
 with distinction said fred who was holding what looked like a piece of very long string 
 
 it would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs said ron 
 
 time is galleons little brother said fred anyway harry interfering with reception extendable ears he added in response to raised eyebrows and held up the string which harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing trying to hear going on downstairs 
 
 you want to be careful said ron staring at the ear if mum sees one of them again 
 
 worth the risk a major meeting having said fred 
 
 the door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared 
 
 oh hello harry said younger sister ginny brightly i thought i heard your voice 
 
 turning to fred and george she said with the extendable ears gone and put an imperturbable charm on the kitchen door 
 
 how know said george looking crestfallen 
 
 tonks told me how to find out said ginny you just chuck stuff at the door and if it make contact the been imperturbed been flicking dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it so no way the extendable ears will be able to get under the gap 
 
 fred heaved a deep sigh 
 
 shame i really fancied finding out what old been up to 
 
 snape said harry quickly is he here 
 
 yeah said george carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds fred and ginny followed giving a report top secret 
 
 git said fred idly 
 
 on our side now said hermione reprovingly 
 
 ron snorted stop him being a git the way he looks at us when he sees us 
 
 bill like him either said ginny as though that settled the matter 
 
 harry was not sure his anger had abated yet but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting he sank on to the bed opposite the others 
 
 is bill here he asked i thought he was working in egypt 
 
 he applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the order said fred he says he misses the tombs but he smirked there are compensations 
 
 what mean 
 
 remember old fleur delacour said george got a job at gringotts to eemprove er eeenglish 
 
 and been giving her a lot of private lessons sniggered fred 
 
 in the order too said george but still in romania dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible so trying to make contacts on his days off 
 
 percy do that harry asked the last he had heard the third weasley brother was working in the department of international magical at the ministry of magic 
 
 at words all the weasleys and hermione exchanged darkly significant looks 
 
 whatever you do mention percy in front of mum and dad ron told harry in a tense voice 
 
 why not 
 
 because every time mentioned dad breaks whatever holding and mum starts crying fred said 
 
 been awful said ginny sadly 
 
 i think well shot of him said george with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face 
 
 happened harry said 
 
 percy and dad had a row said fred never seen dad row with anyone like that normally mum who shouts 
 
 it was the first week back after term ended said ron we were about to come and join the order percy came home and told us been promoted 
 
 kidding said harry 
 
 though he knew perfectly well that percy was highly ambitious impression was that percy had not made a great success of his first job at the ministry of magic percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by lord voldemort not that the ministry had believed itthey all thought mr crouch had gone mad 
 
 yeah we were all surprised said george because percy got into a load of trouble about crouch there was an inquiry and everything they said percy ought to have realised crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior but you know percy crouch left him in charge he going to complain 
 
 so how come they promoted him 
 
 exactly what we wondered said ron who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that harry had stopped yelling he came home really pleased with himselfeven more pleased than usual if you can imagine thatand told dad been offered a position in own office a really good one for someone only a year out of hogwartsjunior assistant to the minister he expected dad to be all impressed i think 
 
 only dad said fred grimly 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 well apparently fudge has been storming round the ministry checking that having any contact with dumbledore said george 
 
 name is mud with the ministry these days see said fred they all think just making trouble saying back 
 
 dad says fudge has made it clear that anyone in league with dumbledore can clear out their desks said george 
 
 trouble is fudge suspects dad he knows friendly with dumbledore and always thought a bit of a weirdo because of his muggle obsession 
 
 but that got to do with percy asked harry confused 
 
 coming to that dad reckons fudge only wants percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the familyand dumbledore 
 
 harry let out a low whistle 
 
 bet percy loved that 
 
 ron laughed in a hollow sort of way 
 
 he went completely berserk he saidwell he said loads of terrible stuff he said been having to struggle against lousy reputation ever since he joined the ministry and that got no ambition and why always beenyou knownot had a lot of money i mean 
 
 what said harry in disbelief as ginny made a noise like an angry cat 
 
 i know said ron in a low voice and it got worse he said dad was an idiot to run around with dumbledore that dumbledore was heading for big trouble and dad was going to go down with him and that hepercyknew where his loyalty lay and it was with the ministry and if mum and dad were going to become traitors to the ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he belong to our family any more and he packed his bags the same night and left living here in london now 
 
 harry swore under his breath he had always liked percy least of brothers but he had never imagined he would say such things to mr weasley 
 
 been in a right state said ron dully you knowcrying and stuff she came up to london to try and talk to percy but he slammed the door in her face i dunno what he does if he meets dad at workignores him i 
 
 but percy must know back said harry slowly not stupid he must know your mum and dad risk everything without proof 
 
 yeah well your name got dragged into the row said ron shooting harry a furtive look percy said the only evidence was your word and i dunno he think it was good enough 
 
 percy takes the daily prophet seriously said hermione tartly and the others all nodded 
 
 what are you talking about harry asked looking around at them all they were all regarding him warily 
 
 you been getting the daily prophet hermione asked nervously 
 
 yeah i have said harry 
 
 have youer been reading it thoroughly hermione asked still more anxiously 
 
 not cover to cover said harry defensively if they were going to report anything about voldemort it would be headline news it 
 
 the others flinched at the sound of the name hermione hurried on well need to read it cover to cover to pick it up but theyumthey mention you a couple of times a week 
 
 but have seen 
 
 not if only been reading the front page you said hermione shaking her head not talking about big articles they just slip you in like a standing joke 
 
 what 
 
 quite nasty actually said hermione in a voice of forced calm just building on stuff 
 
 but not writing for them any more is she 
 
 oh no kept her promisenot that got any choice hermione added with satisfaction but she laid the foundation for what trying to do now 
 
 which is what said harry impatiently 
 
 ok you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that 
 
 yeah said harry who was not likely to forget rita stories about him in a hurry 
 
 well writing about you as though this deluded person who thinks a great tragic hero or something said hermione very fast as though it would be less unpleasant for harry to hear these facts quickly they keep slipping in snide comments about you if some story appears they say something like a tale worthy of harry potter and if anyone has a funny accident or anything hope he got a scar on his forehead or be asked to worship him next 
 
 i want anyone to worship harry began hotly 
 
 i know you said hermione quickly looking frightened i know harry but you see what doing they want to turn you into someone nobody will believe fudge is behind it bet anything they want wizards on the street to think just some stupid boy a bit of a joke who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going 
 
 i ask i want voldemort killed my parents harry spluttered i got famous because he murdered my family but kill me who wants to be famous for that they think rather never 
 
 we know harry said ginny earnestly 
 
 and of course they report a word about the dementors attacking you said hermione told them to keep that quiet that been a really big story dementors they even reported that you broke the international statute of secrecy we thought they would it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid we think biding their time until expelled then really going to go to town i mean if expelled obviously she went on hastily you really be not if they abide by their own laws no case against you 
 
 they were back on the hearing and harry did not want to think about that he cast around for another change of subject but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs 
 
 uh oh 
 
 fred gave the extendable ear a hearty tug there was another loud crack and he and george vanished seconds later mrs weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway 
 
 the over you can come down and have dinner now dying to see you harry and left all those dungbombs outside the kitchen door 
 
 crookshanks said ginny unblushingly he loves playing with them 
 
 oh said mrs weasley i thought it might have been kreacher he keeps doing odd things like that now forget to keep your voices down in the hall ginny your hands are filthy what have you been doing go and wash them before dinner please 
 
 ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room leaving harry alone with ron and hermione both of them were watching him apprehensively as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone the sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed 
 
 look he muttered but ron shook his head and hermione said quietly we knew be angry harry we really blame you but got to understand we did try to persuade dumbledore 
 
 yeah i know said harry grudgingly 
 
 he cast around for a topic that involve his headmaster because the very thought of dumbledore made insides burn with anger again 
 
 kreacher he asked 
 
 the who lives here said ron nutter never met one like him 
 
 hermione frowned at ron 
 
 not a nutter ron 
 
 his ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother said ron irritably is that normal hermione 
 
 wellwell if he is a bit strange not his fault 
 
 ron rolled his eyes at harry 
 
 hermione still given up on spew 
 
 not spew said hermione heatedly the society for the promotion of elfish welfare and not just me dumbledore says we should be kind to kreacher too 
 
 yeah yeah said ron starving 
 
 he led the way out of the door and on to the landing but before they could descend the stairs hold it ron breathed flinging out an arm to stop harry and hermione walking any further still in the hall we might be able to hear something 
 
 the three of them looked cautiously over the banisters the gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards including all of guard they were whispering excitedly together in the very centre of the group harry saw the dark head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at hogwarts professor snape harry leant further over the banisters he was very interested in what snape was doing for the order of the phoenix 
 
 a thin piece of string descended in front of eyes looking up he saw fred and george on the landing above cautiously lowering the extendable ear towards the dark knot of people below a moment later however they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight 
 
 dammit harry heard fred whisper as he hoisted the extendable ear back up again 
 
 they heard the front door open then close 
 
 snape never eats here ron told harry quietly thank god 
 
 and forget to keep your voice down in the hall harry hermione whispered 
 
 as they passed the row of heads on the wall they saw lupin mrs weasley and tonks at the front door magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left 
 
 eating down in the kitchen mrs weasley whispered meeting them at the bottom of the stairs harry dear if just tiptoe across the hall through this door here 
 
 crash 
 
 tonks cried mrs weasley in exasperation turning to look behind her 
 
 sorry wailed tonks who was lying flat on the floor that stupid umbrella stand the second time tripped over 
 
 but the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible screech 
 
 the velvet curtains harry had passed earlier had flown apart but there was no door behind them for a split second harry thought he was looking through a window a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being torturedthen he realised it was simply a portrait but the most realistic and the most unpleasant he had ever seen in his life 
 
 the old woman was drooling her eyes were rolling the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed and all along the hall behind them the other portraits awoke and began to yell too so that harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears 
 
 lupin and mrs weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces 
 
 filth scum of dirt and vileness mutants freaks begone from this place how dare you befoul the house of my fathers 
 
 tonks apologised over and over again dragging the huge heavy leg back off the floor mrs weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall stunning all the other portraits with her wand and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing harry 
 
 shut up you horrible old hag shut up he roared seizing the curtain mrs weasley had abandoned 
 
 the old face blanched 
 
 yoooou she howled her eyes popping at the sight of the man blood traitor abomination shame of my flesh 
 
 i saidshutup roared the man and with a stupendous effort he and lupin managed to force the curtains closed again 
 
 the old screeches died and an echoing silence tell panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes godfather sirius turned to face him 
 
 hello harry he said grimly i see met my mother 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter four horace slughorncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down privet drive together he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them the memory of their last encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of most prized possessions 
 
 dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed 
 
 keep your wand at the ready harry he said brightly 
 
 but i thought not allowed to use magic outside school sir 
 
 if there is an attack said dumbledore i give you permission to use any or curse that might occur to you however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight 
 
 why not sir 
 
 you are with me said dumbledore simply this will do harry 
 
 he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive 
 
 you have not of course passed your apparition test he said 
 
 no said harry i thought you had to be seventeen 
 
 you do said dumbledore so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly my left if you mindas you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment 
 
 harry gripped proffered forearm 
 
 very good said dumbledore well here we go 
 
 harry felt arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then 
 
 he gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes he felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube it was a few seconds before he realized that privet drive had vanished he and dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches his comprehension catching up with his senses harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life 
 
 are you all right asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously the sensation does take some getting used to 
 
 fine said harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly but i think i might prefer brooms 
 
 dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck and said this way 
 
 he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses according to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight 
 
 so tell me harry said dumbledore your scar has it been hurting at all 
 
 harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the mark 
 
 no he said and been wondering about that i thought it would be burning all the time now getting so powerful again 
 
 he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression 
 
 i on the other hand thought otherwise said dumbledore lord voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you 
 
 well not complaining said harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into mind 
 
 they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter harry looked sideways at dumbledore again professor 
 
 harry 
 
 erwhere exactly are we 
 
 this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton 
 
 and what are we doing here 
 
 ah yes of course i told you said dumbledore well i have lost count of the number of times i have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts 
 
 how can i help with that sir 
 
 oh i think find a use for you said dumbledore vaguely left here harry 
 
 they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses all the windows were dark the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket 
 
 professor why we just apparate directly into your old house 
 
 because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said dumbledore courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry in any case most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted apparators at hogwarts for instance 
 
 you apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds said harry quickly hermione granger told me 
 
 and she is quite right we turn left again 
 
 the church clock chimed midnight behind them harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask 
 
 sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge has been sacked 
 
 correct said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office 
 
 is he do you think good asked harry 
 
 an interesting question said dumbledore he is able certainly a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius 
 
 yes but i meant 
 
 i know what you meant rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate lord voldemort 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it 
 
 and sir i saw about madam bones 
 
 yes said dumbledore quietly a terrible loss she was a great witch just up here i think ouch 
 
 he had pointed with his injured hand 
 
 professor what happened to your 
 
 i have no time to explain now said dumbledore it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice 
 
 he smiled at harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions 
 
 sir i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the death eaters 
 
 yes i received one myself said dumbledore still smiling did you find it useful 
 
 not really 
 
 no i thought not you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor 
 
 i harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not 
 
 for future reference harry it is raspberry although of course if i were a death eater i would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself 
 
 er right said harry well on that leaflet it said something about inferi what exactly are they the leaflet very clear 
 
 they are corpses said dumbledore calmly dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a dark bidding inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort was last powerful he killed enough people to make an army of them of course this is the place harry just here 
 
 they were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him 
 
 oh dear oh dear dear dear 
 
 harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink the front door was hanging off its hinges 
 
 dumbledore glanced up and down the street it seemed quite deserted 
 
 wand out and follow me harry he said quietly 
 
 he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready 
 
 lumos 
 
 wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway to the left another door stood open holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him 
 
 a scene of total devastation met their eyes a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor the wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper small intake of breath made dumbledore look around 
 
 not pretty is it he said heavily yes something horrible has happened here 
 
 dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet harry followed gazing around of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body 
 
 maybe there was a fight and and they dragged him off professor harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls 
 
 i think so said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side 
 
 you mean 
 
 still here somewhere yes 
 
 and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled ouch 
 
 good evening horace said dumbledore straightening up again 
 
 jaw dropped where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye 
 
 there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet it hurt 
 
 the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas the top of his head barely reached chin 
 
 what gave it away he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair 
 
 my dear horace said dumbledore looking amused if the death eaters really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house 
 
 the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead 
 
 the dark mark he muttered knew there was something ah well have had time anyway only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room 
 
 he heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter 
 
 would you like my assistance clearing up asked dumbledore politely 
 
 please said the other 
 
 they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion 
 
 the furniture flew back to its original places ornaments in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean 
 
 what kind of blood was that incidentally asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock 
 
 on the walls dragon shouted the wizard called horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling 
 
 there was a final plunk from the piano and silence 
 
 yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally my last bottle and prices are at the moment still it might be reusable 
 
 he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within 
 
 hmm bit dusty 
 
 he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed it was then that his gaze fell upon harry 
 
 oho he said his large round eyes flying to forehead and the scar it bore oho 
 
 this said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is harry potter harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn 
 
 slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd 
 
 so how you thought persuade me is it well the no albus 
 
 he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation 
 
 i suppose we can have a drink at least asked dumbledore for old sake 
 
 slughorn hesitated 
 
 all right then one drink he said ungraciously 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon harry 
 
 hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes here he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence his legs were so short they did not touch the floor 
 
 well how have you been keeping horace dumbledore asked 
 
 not so well said slughorn at once weak chest wheezy rheumatism too move like i used to well to be expected old age fatigue 
 
 and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said dumbledore you have had more than three minutes warning 
 
 slughorn said half irritably half proudly two hear my intruder charm go off i was taking a bath still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that an old man albus a tired old man earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts 
 
 he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room it was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady 
 
 not yet as old as i am horace said dumbledore 
 
 well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly his pale gooseberry eyes had found injured hand reactions not what they were i see 
 
 quite right said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made the back of neck prickle unpleasantly i am undoubtedly slower than i was but on the other hand 
 
 he shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead 
 
 so all these precautions against intruders horace are they for the death eaters benefit or mine asked dumbledore 
 
 what would the death eaters want with a poor old buffer like me demanded slughorn 
 
 i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said dumbledore are you really telling me that they come recruiting yet 
 
 slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered i given them the chance been on the move for a year never stay in one place more than a week move from muggle house to muggle housethe owners of this place are on holiday in the canary been very pleasant be sorry to leave quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors spot you bringing in the piano 
 
 ingenious said dumbledore but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a old buffer in search of a quiet life now if you were to return to hogwarts 
 
 if going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since dolores umbridge left if how you treat teachers these days 
 
 professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said dumbledore i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs filthy 
 
 what she did did she said slughorn idiotic woman never liked her 
 
 harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him 
 
 sorry harry said hastily justi like her either 
 
 dumbledore stood up rather suddenly 
 
 are you leaving asked slughorn at once looking hopeful 
 
 no i was wondering whether i might use your bathroom said dumbledore 
 
 oh said slughorn clearly disappointed second on the left down the hall 
 
 dumbledore strode from the room once the door had closed behind him there was silence after a few moments slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind 
 
 think i know why brought you he said abruptly 
 
 harry merely looked at slughorn watery eyes slid over scar this time taking in the rest of his face 
 
 you look very like your father 
 
 yeah been told said harry 
 
 except for your eyes got 
 
 my eyes yeah harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing 
 
 hmpf yes well you have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine your mother slughorn added in answer to questioning look lily evans one of the brightest i ever taught vivacious you know charming girl i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house very cheeky answers i used to get back too 
 
 which was your house 
 
 i was head of slytherin said slughorn oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on face and wagging a stubby ringer at him go holding that against me be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually goes in families not always though ever heard of sirius black you must have donebeen in the papers for the last couple of yearsdied a few weeks ago 
 
 it was as though an invisible hand had twisted intestines and held them tight 
 
 well anyway he was a big pal of your at school the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor shamehe was a talented boy i got his brother regulus when he came along but have liked the set 
 
 he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside 
 
 your mother was of course believe it when i found out thought she must have been she was so good 
 
 one of my best friends is said harry and the best in our year 
 
 funny how that sometimes happens it said slughorn 
 
 not really said harry coldly 
 
 slughorn looked down at him in surprise 
 
 you think prejudiced he said no no no i just said your mother was one of my favorite students and there was dirk cresswell in the year after her toonow head of the goblin liaison office of courseanother a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the at gringotts 
 
 he bounced up and down a little smiling in a way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants 
 
 all all signed notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet always interested to hear my take on the news and ambrosius flume of honeydukesa hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkisss who gave him his first job and at the back see her if you just crane your gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies people are always astonished to hear on terms with the harpies and free tickets whenever i want them 
 
 this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously 
 
 and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eaters had not yet tracked down slughorn if hampers of sweets quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him 
 
 the smile slid from face as quickly as the blood from his walls 
 
 of course not he said looking down at harry i have been out of touch with everybody for a year 
 
 harry had the impression that the words shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment then he shrugged 
 
 still the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while sure very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i personally fancy the mortality rate 
 
 you have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats most of the teachers in it and none of them has ever been killedwell unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with voldemort 
 
 harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear name spoken aloud and was not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored 
 
 i reckon the staff are safer than most people while headmaster supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared he harry went on 
 
 slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over words 
 
 well yes it is true that has never sought a fight with dumbledore he muttered grudgingly and i suppose one could argue that as i have not joined the death eaters can hardly count me a friend in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus i cannot pretend that amelia death did not shake me if she with all her ministry contacts and protection 
 
 dumbledore the room and slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house 
 
 oh there you are albus he said been a very long time upset stomach 
 
 no i was merely reading the muggle magazines said dumbledore i do love knitting patterns well harry we have trespassed upon hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for us to leave 
 
 not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his feet slughorn seemed taken aback 
 
 leaving 
 
 yes indeed i think i know a lost cause when i see one 
 
 lost 
 
 slughorn seemed agitated he twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket 
 
 well sorry you want the job horace said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to 
 
 yes well very gracious as i say 
 
 goodbye then 
 
 bye said harry 
 
 they were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them 
 
 all right all right do it 
 
 dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room 
 
 you will come out of retirement 
 
 yes yes said slughorn impatiently i must be mad but yes 
 
 wonderful said dumbledore beaming then horace we shall see you on the first of september 
 
 yes i daresay you will grunted slughorn 
 
 as they set off down the garden path voice floated after them want a pay rise dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore chuckled the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist 
 
 well done harry said dumbledore 
 
 i do anything said harry in surprise 
 
 oh yes you did you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts did you like him 
 
 er 
 
 harry sure whether he liked slughorn or not he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a should make a good witch 
 
 horace said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort he also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful he enjoys the feeling that he influences these people he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseatmore room to spread out you see he used to handpick favorites at hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office 
 
 harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer 
 
 i tell you all this dumbledore continued not to turn you against horaceor as we must now call him professor slughornbut to put you on your guard he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry you would be the jewel of his collection the boy who lived or as they call you these days the chosen one 
 
 at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him 
 
 neither can live while the other survives 
 
 dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier 
 
 this will do harry if you will grasp my arm 
 
 braced this time harry was ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it ron was in there and so was mrs weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew 
 
 if you mind harry said dumbledore as they passed through the gate like a few words with you before we part in private perhaps in here 
 
 dumbledore pointed toward a stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomsticks a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry 
 
 i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you 
 
 harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him he did not think he could stand to discuss sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say his dead and even worse to hear name thrown out casually by slughorn 
 
 it was cruel said dumbledore softly that you and sirius had such a short time together a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship 
 
 harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing hat he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors 
 
 just hard harry said finally in a low voice to realize he write to me again 
 
 his eyes burned suddenly and he blinked he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again 
 
 sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said dumbledore gently naturally the loss is devastating 
 
 but while i was at the dursleys interrupted harry his voice growing stronger i realized i shut myself away oror crack up sirius have wanted that would he and anyway too short look at madam bones look at emmeline vance it could be me next it but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and voldemort too if i can manage it 
 
 spoken both like your mother and son and true godson said dumbledore with an approving pat on back i take my hat off to youor i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spiders 
 
 and now harry on a closely related subject i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two weeks 
 
 yes said harry and his heart beat a little faster 
 
 then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy 
 
 yes said harry again and now everyone knows that the one 
 
 no they do not interrupted dumbledore there are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you 
 
 now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said 
 
 no said harry 
 
 a wise decision on the whole said dumbledore although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger yes he continued when harry looked startled i think they ought to know you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them 
 
 i want 
 
 to worry or frighten them said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his spectacles or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friends harry as you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away 
 
 harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer he continued on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year 
 
 privatewith you said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence 
 
 yes i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education 
 
 what will you be teaching me sir 
 
 oh a little of this a little of that said dumbledore airily 
 
 harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly 
 
 if having lessons with you i have to do occlumency lessons with snape will i 
 
 professor snape harryand no you will not 
 
 good said harry in relief because they were a 
 
 he stopped careful not to say what he really thought 
 
 i think the word fiasco would be a good one here said dumbledore nodding 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 well that means i see much of professor snape from now on he said because he let me carry on potions unless i get outstanding in my which i know i 
 
 count your owls before they are delivered said dumbledore gravely which now i think of it ought to be some time later today now two more things harry before we part 
 
 firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all times from this moment onward even within hogwarts itself just in case you understand me 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 and lastly while you stay here the burrow has been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide these measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and mollyall their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them 
 
 i understand said harry quickly 
 
 very well then said dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard i see a light in the kitchen let us not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are

lionfish nov chapter four horace slughorncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down privet drive together he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them the memory of their last encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of most prized possessions 
 
 dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed 
 
 keep your wand at the ready harry he said brightly 
 
 but i thought not allowed to use magic outside school sir 
 
 if there is an attack said dumbledore i give you permission to use any or curse that might occur to you however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight 
 
 why not sir 
 
 you are with me said dumbledore simply this will do harry 
 
 he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive 
 
 you have not of course passed your apparition test he said 
 
 no said harry i thought you had to be seventeen 
 
 you do said dumbledore so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly my left if you mindas you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment 
 
 harry gripped proffered forearm 
 
 very good said dumbledore well here we go 
 
 harry felt arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then 
 
 he gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes he felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube it was a few seconds before he realized that privet drive had vanished he and dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches his comprehension catching up with his senses harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life 
 
 are you all right asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously the sensation does take some getting used to 
 
 fine said harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly but i think i might prefer brooms 
 
 dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck and said this way 
 
 he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses according to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight 
 
 so tell me harry said dumbledore your scar has it been hurting at all 
 
 harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the mark 
 
 no he said and been wondering about that i thought it would be burning all the time now getting so powerful again 
 
 he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression 
 
 i on the other hand thought otherwise said dumbledore lord voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you 
 
 well not complaining said harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into mind 
 
 they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter harry looked sideways at dumbledore again professor 
 
 harry 
 
 erwhere exactly are we 
 
 this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton 
 
 and what are we doing here 
 
 ah yes of course i told you said dumbledore well i have lost count of the number of times i have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts 
 
 how can i help with that sir 
 
 oh i think find a use for you said dumbledore vaguely left here harry 
 
 they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses all the windows were dark the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two weeks persisted here too thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket 
 
 professor why we just apparate directly into your old house 
 
 because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said dumbledore courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry in any case most wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted apparators at hogwarts for instance 
 
 you apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds said harry quickly hermione granger told me 
 
 and she is quite right we turn left again 
 
 the church clock chimed midnight behind them harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask 
 
 sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge has been sacked 
 
 correct said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street he has been replaced as i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office 
 
 is he do you think good asked harry 
 
 an interesting question said dumbledore he is able certainly a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius 
 
 yes but i meant 
 
 i know what you meant rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate lord voldemort 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it 
 
 and sir i saw about madam bones 
 
 yes said dumbledore quietly a terrible loss she was a great witch just up here i think ouch 
 
 he had pointed with his injured hand 
 
 professor what happened to your 
 
 i have no time to explain now said dumbledore it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice 
 
 he smiled at harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions 
 
 sir i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the death eaters 
 
 yes i received one myself said dumbledore still smiling did you find it useful 
 
 not really 
 
 no i thought not you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor 
 
 i harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not 
 
 for future reference harry it is raspberry although of course if i were a death eater i would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself 
 
 er right said harry well on that leaflet it said something about inferi what exactly are they the leaflet very clear 
 
 they are corpses said dumbledore calmly dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a dark bidding inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort was last powerful he killed enough people to make an army of them of course this is the place harry just here 
 
 they were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him 
 
 oh dear oh dear dear dear 
 
 harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink the front door was hanging off its hinges 
 
 dumbledore glanced up and down the street it seemed quite deserted 
 
 wand out and follow me harry he said quietly 
 
 he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready 
 
 lumos 
 
 wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway to the left another door stood open holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him 
 
 a scene of total devastation met their eyes a grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword a piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor the wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper small intake of breath made dumbledore look around 
 
 not pretty is it he said heavily yes something horrible has happened here 
 
 dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet harry followed gazing around of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body 
 
 maybe there was a fight and and they dragged him off professor harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls 
 
 i think so said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side 
 
 you mean 
 
 still here somewhere yes 
 
 and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled ouch 
 
 good evening horace said dumbledore straightening up again 
 
 jaw dropped where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye 
 
 there was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet it hurt 
 
 the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas the top of his head barely reached chin 
 
 what gave it away he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair 
 
 my dear horace said dumbledore looking amused if the death eaters really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house 
 
 the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead 
 
 the dark mark he muttered knew there was something ah well have had time anyway only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room 
 
 he heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter 
 
 would you like my assistance clearing up asked dumbledore politely 
 
 please said the other 
 
 they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion 
 
 the furniture flew back to its original places ornaments in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean 
 
 what kind of blood was that incidentally asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock 
 
 on the walls dragon shouted the wizard called horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling 
 
 there was a final plunk from the piano and silence 
 
 yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally my last bottle and prices are at the moment still it might be reusable 
 
 he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within 
 
 hmm bit dusty 
 
 he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed it was then that his gaze fell upon harry 
 
 oho he said his large round eyes flying to forehead and the scar it bore oho 
 
 this said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is harry potter harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn 
 
 slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd 
 
 so how you thought persuade me is it well the no albus 
 
 he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation 
 
 i suppose we can have a drink at least asked dumbledore for old sake 
 
 slughorn hesitated 
 
 all right then one drink he said ungraciously 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon harry 
 
 hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes here he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence his legs were so short they did not touch the floor 
 
 well how have you been keeping horace dumbledore asked 
 
 not so well said slughorn at once weak chest wheezy rheumatism too move like i used to well to be expected old age fatigue 
 
 and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said dumbledore you have had more than three minutes warning 
 
 slughorn said half irritably half proudly two hear my intruder charm go off i was taking a bath still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that an old man albus a tired old man earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts 
 
 he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room it was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady 
 
 not yet as old as i am horace said dumbledore 
 
 well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly his pale gooseberry eyes had found injured hand reactions not what they were i see 
 
 quite right said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made the back of neck prickle unpleasantly i am undoubtedly slower than i was but on the other hand 
 
 he shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead 
 
 so all these precautions against intruders horace are they for the death eaters benefit or mine asked dumbledore 
 
 what would the death eaters want with a poor old buffer like me demanded slughorn 
 
 i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said dumbledore are you really telling me that they come recruiting yet 
 
 slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered i given them the chance been on the move for a year never stay in one place more than a week move from muggle house to muggle housethe owners of this place are on holiday in the canary been very pleasant be sorry to leave quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors spot you bringing in the piano 
 
 ingenious said dumbledore but it sounds a rather tiring existence for a old buffer in search of a quiet life now if you were to return to hogwarts 
 
 if going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus i might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since dolores umbridge left if how you treat teachers these days 
 
 professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said dumbledore i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs filthy 
 
 what she did did she said slughorn idiotic woman never liked her 
 
 harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him 
 
 sorry harry said hastily justi like her either 
 
 dumbledore stood up rather suddenly 
 
 are you leaving asked slughorn at once looking hopeful 
 
 no i was wondering whether i might use your bathroom said dumbledore 
 
 oh said slughorn clearly disappointed second on the left down the hall 
 
 dumbledore strode from the room once the door had closed behind him there was silence after a few moments slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind 
 
 think i know why brought you he said abruptly 
 
 harry merely looked at slughorn watery eyes slid over scar this time taking in the rest of his face 
 
 you look very like your father 
 
 yeah been told said harry 
 
 except for your eyes got 
 
 my eyes yeah harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing 
 
 hmpf yes well you have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine your mother slughorn added in answer to questioning look lily evans one of the brightest i ever taught vivacious you know charming girl i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house very cheeky answers i used to get back too 
 
 which was your house 
 
 i was head of slytherin said slughorn oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on face and wagging a stubby ringer at him go holding that against me be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually goes in families not always though ever heard of sirius black you must have donebeen in the papers for the last couple of yearsdied a few weeks ago 
 
 it was as though an invisible hand had twisted intestines and held them tight 
 
 well anyway he was a big pal of your at school the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor shamehe was a talented boy i got his brother regulus when he came along but have liked the set 
 
 he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside 
 
 your mother was of course believe it when i found out thought she must have been she was so good 
 
 one of my best friends is said harry and the best in our year 
 
 funny how that sometimes happens it said slughorn 
 
 not really said harry coldly 
 
 slughorn looked down at him in surprise 
 
 you think prejudiced he said no no no i just said your mother was one of my favorite students and there was dirk cresswell in the year after her toonow head of the goblin liaison office of courseanother a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the at gringotts 
 
 he bounced up and down a little smiling in a way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants 
 
 all all signed notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet always interested to hear my take on the news and ambrosius flume of honeydukesa hamper every birthday and all because i was able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkisss who gave him his first job and at the back see her if you just crane your gwenog jones who of course captains the holyhead harpies people are always astonished to hear on terms with the harpies and free tickets whenever i want them 
 
 this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously 
 
 and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eaters had not yet tracked down slughorn if hampers of sweets quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him 
 
 the smile slid from face as quickly as the blood from his walls 
 
 of course not he said looking down at harry i have been out of touch with everybody for a year 
 
 harry had the impression that the words shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment then he shrugged 
 
 still the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while sure very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i personally fancy the mortality rate 
 
 you have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it was hard to sympathize with cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats most of the teachers in it and none of them has ever been killedwell unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with voldemort 
 
 harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear name spoken aloud and was not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored 
 
 i reckon the staff are safer than most people while headmaster supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared he harry went on 
 
 slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over words 
 
 well yes it is true that has never sought a fight with dumbledore he muttered grudgingly and i suppose one could argue that as i have not joined the death eaters can hardly count me a friend in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus i cannot pretend that amelia death did not shake me if she with all her ministry contacts and protection 
 
 dumbledore the room and slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house 
 
 oh there you are albus he said been a very long time upset stomach 
 
 no i was merely reading the muggle magazines said dumbledore i do love knitting patterns well harry we have trespassed upon hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for us to leave 
 
 not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his feet slughorn seemed taken aback 
 
 leaving 
 
 yes indeed i think i know a lost cause when i see one 
 
 lost 
 
 slughorn seemed agitated he twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket 
 
 well sorry you want the job horace said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to 
 
 yes well very gracious as i say 
 
 goodbye then 
 
 bye said harry 
 
 they were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them 
 
 all right all right do it 
 
 dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room 
 
 you will come out of retirement 
 
 yes yes said slughorn impatiently i must be mad but yes 
 
 wonderful said dumbledore beaming then horace we shall see you on the first of september 
 
 yes i daresay you will grunted slughorn 
 
 as they set off down the garden path voice floated after them want a pay rise dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore chuckled the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist 
 
 well done harry said dumbledore 
 
 i do anything said harry in surprise 
 
 oh yes you did you showed horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to hogwarts did you like him 
 
 er 
 
 harry sure whether he liked slughorn or not he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a should make a good witch 
 
 horace said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort he also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful he enjoys the feeling that he influences these people he has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseatmore room to spread out you see he used to handpick favorites at hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office 
 
 harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer 
 
 i tell you all this dumbledore continued not to turn you against horaceor as we must now call him professor slughornbut to put you on your guard he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry you would be the jewel of his collection the boy who lived or as they call you these days the chosen one 
 
 at these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry he was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him 
 
 neither can live while the other survives 
 
 dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier 
 
 this will do harry if you will grasp my arm 
 
 braced this time harry was ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it ron was in there and so was mrs weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew 
 
 if you mind harry said dumbledore as they passed through the gate like a few words with you before we part in private perhaps in here 
 
 dumbledore pointed toward a stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomsticks a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry 
 
 i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the ministry permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you 
 
 harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him he did not think he could stand to discuss sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say his dead and even worse to hear name thrown out casually by slughorn 
 
 it was cruel said dumbledore softly that you and sirius had such a short time together a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship 
 
 harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing hat he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors 
 
 just hard harry said finally in a low voice to realize he write to me again 
 
 his eyes burned suddenly and he blinked he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again 
 
 sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said dumbledore gently naturally the loss is devastating 
 
 but while i was at the dursleys interrupted harry his voice growing stronger i realized i shut myself away oror crack up sirius have wanted that would he and anyway too short look at madam bones look at emmeline vance it could be me next it but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight make sure i take as many death eaters with me as i can and voldemort too if i can manage it 
 
 spoken both like your mother and son and true godson said dumbledore with an approving pat on back i take my hat off to youor i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spiders 
 
 and now harry on a closely related subject i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two weeks 
 
 yes said harry and his heart beat a little faster 
 
 then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy 
 
 yes said harry again and now everyone knows that the one 
 
 no they do not interrupted dumbledore there are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you 
 
 now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said 
 
 no said harry 
 
 a wise decision on the whole said dumbledore although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger yes he continued when harry looked startled i think they ought to know you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them 
 
 i want 
 
 to worry or frighten them said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his spectacles or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friends harry as you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away 
 
 harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer he continued on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year 
 
 privatewith you said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence 
 
 yes i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education 
 
 what will you be teaching me sir 
 
 oh a little of this a little of that said dumbledore airily 
 
 harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly 
 
 if having lessons with you i have to do occlumency lessons with snape will i 
 
 professor snape harryand no you will not 
 
 good said harry in relief because they were a 
 
 he stopped careful not to say what he really thought 
 
 i think the word fiasco would be a good one here said dumbledore nodding 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 well that means i see much of professor snape from now on he said because he let me carry on potions unless i get outstanding in my which i know i 
 
 count your owls before they are delivered said dumbledore gravely which now i think of it ought to be some time later today now two more things harry before we part 
 
 firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all times from this moment onward even within hogwarts itself just in case you understand me 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 and lastly while you stay here the burrow has been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide these measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and mollyall their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them 
 
 i understand said harry quickly 
 
 very well then said dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard i see a light in the kitchen let us not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are

 harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road dedaluss top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone 
 
 harry picked up hedwigs cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs the light was fading rapidly the hall full of shadows in the evening light it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudleys computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content it gave him an odd empty feeling remembering those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost 
 
 dont you want to take a last look at the place he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing well never be here again dont you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat what memories dudley sobbed on it after i saved him from the dementors turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door 
 
 harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing harry turned his back on the front door 
 
 and under here hedwig c harry pulled open a door under the stairs c is where i used to sleep you never knew me then c blimey its small id forgotten 
 
 harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once c uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it c a flying motorbike 
 
 there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernons choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden 
 
 the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses 
 
 wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said all righ harry ready fer the off 
 
 definitely said harry beaming around at them all but i wasnt expecting this many of you 
 
 change of plan growled who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity lets get undercover before we talk you through it 
 
 harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunias gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and longhaired mr weasley balding his spectacles a little awry his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald and hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy beady hounds eyes and matted hair harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met 
 
 kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister he called across the room 
 
 he can get along without me for one night said kingsley youre more important 
 
 harry guess what said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glistened there 
 
 you got married harry yelped looking from her to lupin 
 
 im sorry you couldnt be there harry it was very quiet 
 
 thats brilliant congrat c 
 
 all right all right well have time for a cozy later roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already what hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely 
 
 second problem youre underage which means youve still got the trace on you 
 
 i dont c 
 
 the trace the trace said impatiently the charm that detects magical activity around the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters 
 
 we cant wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper 
 
 harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse 
 
 so what are we going to do 
 
 were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrids motorbike 
 
 harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give the chance to address them 
 
 now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or c moody gestured around the pristine kitchen c you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 so this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen 
 
 the one thing weve got on our side is that doesnt know were moving you tonight weve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think youre not leaving until the thirtieth however this is were dealing with so we cant rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the order my house kingsleys place mollys auntie muriels c you get the idea 
 
 yeah said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan 
 
 youll be going to tonkss parents once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions 
 
 er c yes said harry maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once c he performed a quick headcount c fourteen of us fly off toward tonkss parents 
 
 ah said moody i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us wont be flying to tonkss parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house 
 
 from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately 
 
 no he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen no way 
 
 i told them youd take it like this said hermione with a hint of complacency 
 
 if you think im going to let six people risk their lives c 
 
 c because its the first time for all of us said ron 
 
 this is different pretending to be me c 
 
 well none of us really fancy it harry said fred earnestly imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever 
 
 harry did not smile 
 
 you cant do it if i dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair 
 
 well thats the plan scuppered said george obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate 
 
 yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance said fred 
 
 funny said harry really amusing 
 
 if it has to come to force then it will growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry everyone heres overage potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk 
 
 mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of moodys head 
 
 lets have no more arguments times wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now 
 
 but this is mad theres no need c 
 
 no need snarled moody with out there and half the ministry on his side potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out its what id do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even cant split himself into seven 
 
 harry caught hermiones eye and looked away at once 
 
 so potter c some of your hair if you please 
 
 harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a sort of way 
 
 now barked moody 
 
 with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled 
 
 good said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion straight in here if you please 
 
 harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold 
 
 ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry said hermione before catching sight of rons raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying oh you know what i mean c goyles potion tasted like bogies 
 
 right then fake potters line up over here please said moody 
 
 ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunias gleaming sink 
 
 were one short said lupin 
 
 here said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead 
 
 im a soldier id sooner be a protector said mundungus 
 
 shut it growled moody as ive already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said would want to finish potter in person itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eatersll want to kill them 
 
 mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one 
 
 altogether then 
 
 ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermiones and fleurs appearing to shoot backward into their skulls 
 
 moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him 
 
 fred and george turned to each other and said together wow c were identical 
 
 i dunno though i think im still said fred examining his reflection in the kettle 
 
 bah said fleur checking herself in the microwave door bill dont look at me c im ideous 
 
 those whose clothes are a bit roomy ive got smaller here said moody indicating the first sack and vice versa dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket and when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack 
 
 the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own 
 
 i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo said ron looking down at his bare chest 
 
 harry your eyesight really is awful said hermione as she put on glasses 
 
 once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack 
 
 good said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and harrys faced him the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom c 
 
 whym i with you grunted the harry nearest the back door 
 
 because youre the one that needs watching growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued arthur and fred c 
 
 im george said the twin at whom moody was pointing cant you even tell us apart when were harry 
 
 sorry george c 
 
 im only yanking your wand im fred really c 
 
 enough messing around snarled moody the other one c george or fred or whoever you are c youre with remus miss delacour c 
 
 im taking fleur on a thestral said bill shes not that fond of brooms 
 
 fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again 
 
 miss granger with kingsley again by thestral c 
 
 hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsleys smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick 
 
 which leaves you and me ron said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him 
 
 ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione 
 
 an youre with me harry that all righ said hagrid looking a little anxious well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar 
 
 thats great said harry not altogether truthfully 
 
 we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters were betting theyll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door i make it three minutes until were supposed to leave no point locking the back door it wont keep the death eaters out when they come looking come on 
 
 harry hurried to gather his rucksack firebolt and hedwigs cage and followed the group to the dark back garden 
 
 on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on 
 
 is this it is this siriuss bike 
 
 the very same said hagrid beaming down at harry an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand 
 
 harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwigs cage between his knees he was extremely uncomfortable 
 
 arthurs done a bit o tinkerin said hagrid quite oblivious to harrys discomfort he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground its got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer 
 
 please be careful hagrid said mr weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies 
 
 all right then said moody everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost 
 
 everybody motioned their heads hold tight now ron said tonks and harry saw ron throw a forcing guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate 
 
 good luck everyone shouted moody see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three 
 
 there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwigs cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was 
 
 and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the middle of which the order members had risen oblivious c screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwigs cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees c 
 
 no c help 
 
 the broomstick spun too but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again a seconds relief and then another burst of green light the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage 
 
 no c no 
 
 the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle 
 
 hedwig c hedwig c 
 
 but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were c 
 
 hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwigs cage into the floor refusing to believe that she was dead hagrid turn around 
 
 my jobs ter get you there safe harry bellow hagrid and he opened the throttle stop c stop harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrids broad back hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them wriggling around he cried stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it 
 
 hold on harry thisll do for em roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge a wall a solid black wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up 
 
 more killing curses flew past harrys head from the two remaining death eaters wands they were aiming for hagrid harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening c 
 
 here we go again harry hold on yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button this time a great net burst from the bikes exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it 
 
 thisll do it harry hold on tight yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer 
 
 with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration 
 
 its all righ harry bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bikes slipstream 
 
 im on it harry don worry hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 hagrid no let me 
 
 reparo 
 
 there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bikes flight then the sidecar began to lose height c 
 
 in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted wingardium leviosa 
 
 the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split seconds relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in 
 
 im comin harry hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled impedimenta 
 
 the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him c then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat c 
 
 im comin harry im comin 
 
 a huge hand seized the back of harrys robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbikes seat and found himself with hagrid as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled confringo 
 
 he knew a dreadful pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished 
 
 harry im sorry im sorry moaned hagrid i shouldnta tried ter repair it meself c yehve got no room c 
 
 its not a problem just keep flying harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer 
 
 as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the button again with harry seated so insecurely harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike c stan c 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled 
 
 thats him its him its the real one 
 
 the hooded death eaters shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbikes engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view 
 
 harry whats happened bellowed hagrid whereve they gone 
 
 i dont know 
 
 but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted its the real one how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace where were they 
 
 he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrids jacket 
 
 hagrid do the thing again lets get out of here 
 
 hold on tight then harry 
 
 there was a deafening screeching roar again and the fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars c i think weve lost em harry i think weve done it yelled hagrid 
 
 but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand its him its the real one they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan 
 
 were nearly there harry weve nearly made it shouted hagrid 
 
 harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars 
 
 then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind c and then harry saw him voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again c 
 
 hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control c 
 
 green jets of light shot past them again harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm c 
 
 no 
 
 with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick c 
 
 barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream mine 
 
 it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard avada c 
 
 as the pain from harrys scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the button he punched it with his hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground 
 
 hagrid harry called holding on to the bike for dear life hagrid c accio hagrid 
 
 the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream your wand selwyn give me your wand 
 
 he felt voldemort before he saw him looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more c 
 
 and then voldemort vanished harry looked down and saw hagrid on the ground below him he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter four the seven potterscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road dedaluss top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone 
 
 harry picked up hedwigs cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs the light was fading rapidly the hall full of shadows in the evening light it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudleys computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content it gave him an odd empty feeling remembering those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost 
 
 dont you want to take a last look at the place he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing well never be here again dont you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat what memories dudley sobbed on it after i saved him from the dementors turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door 
 
 harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing harry turned his back on the front door 
 
 and under here hedwig c harry pulled open a door under the stairs c is where i used to sleep you never knew me then c blimey its small id forgotten 
 
 harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once c uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it c a flying motorbike 
 
 there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernons choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden 
 
 the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses 
 
 wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said all righ harry ready fer the off 
 
 definitely said harry beaming around at them all but i wasnt expecting this many of you 
 
 change of plan growled who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity lets get undercover before we talk you through it 
 
 harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunias gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and longhaired mr weasley balding his spectacles a little awry his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald and hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy beady hounds eyes and matted hair harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met 
 
 kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister he called across the room 
 
 he can get along without me for one night said kingsley youre more important 
 
 harry guess what said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glistened there 
 
 you got married harry yelped looking from her to lupin 
 
 im sorry you couldnt be there harry it was very quiet 
 
 thats brilliant congrat c 
 
 all right all right well have time for a cozy later roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already what hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely 
 
 second problem youre underage which means youve still got the trace on you 
 
 i dont c 
 
 the trace the trace said impatiently the charm that detects magical activity around the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters 
 
 we cant wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper 
 
 harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse 
 
 so what are we going to do 
 
 were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrids motorbike 
 
 harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give the chance to address them 
 
 now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or c moody gestured around the pristine kitchen c you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 so this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen 
 
 the one thing weve got on our side is that doesnt know were moving you tonight weve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think youre not leaving until the thirtieth however this is were dealing with so we cant rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the order my house kingsleys place mollys auntie muriels c you get the idea 
 
 yeah said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan 
 
 youll be going to tonkss parents once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions 
 
 er c yes said harry maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once c he performed a quick headcount c fourteen of us fly off toward tonkss parents 
 
 ah said moody i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us wont be flying to tonkss parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house 
 
 from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately 
 
 no he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen no way 
 
 i told them youd take it like this said hermione with a hint of complacency 
 
 if you think im going to let six people risk their lives c 
 
 c because its the first time for all of us said ron 
 
 this is different pretending to be me c 
 
 well none of us really fancy it harry said fred earnestly imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever 
 
 harry did not smile 
 
 you cant do it if i dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair 
 
 well thats the plan scuppered said george obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate 
 
 yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance said fred 
 
 funny said harry really amusing 
 
 if it has to come to force then it will growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry everyone heres overage potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk 
 
 mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of moodys head 
 
 lets have no more arguments times wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now 
 
 but this is mad theres no need c 
 
 no need snarled moody with out there and half the ministry on his side potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out its what id do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even cant split himself into seven 
 
 harry caught hermiones eye and looked away at once 
 
 so potter c some of your hair if you please 
 
 harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a sort of way 
 
 now barked moody 
 
 with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled 
 
 good said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion straight in here if you please 
 
 harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold 
 
 ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry said hermione before catching sight of rons raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying oh you know what i mean c goyles potion tasted like bogies 
 
 right then fake potters line up over here please said moody 
 
 ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunias gleaming sink 
 
 were one short said lupin 
 
 here said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead 
 
 im a soldier id sooner be a protector said mundungus 
 
 shut it growled moody as ive already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said would want to finish potter in person itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eatersll want to kill them 
 
 mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one 
 
 altogether then 
 
 ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermiones and fleurs appearing to shoot backward into their skulls 
 
 moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him 
 
 fred and george turned to each other and said together wow c were identical 
 
 i dunno though i think im still said fred examining his reflection in the kettle 
 
 bah said fleur checking herself in the microwave door bill dont look at me c im ideous 
 
 those whose clothes are a bit roomy ive got smaller here said moody indicating the first sack and vice versa dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket and when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack 
 
 the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own 
 
 i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo said ron looking down at his bare chest 
 
 harry your eyesight really is awful said hermione as she put on glasses 
 
 once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack 
 
 good said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and harrys faced him the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom c 
 
 whym i with you grunted the harry nearest the back door 
 
 because youre the one that needs watching growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued arthur and fred c 
 
 im george said the twin at whom moody was pointing cant you even tell us apart when were harry 
 
 sorry george c 
 
 im only yanking your wand im fred really c 
 
 enough messing around snarled moody the other one c george or fred or whoever you are c youre with remus miss delacour c 
 
 im taking fleur on a thestral said bill shes not that fond of brooms 
 
 fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again 
 
 miss granger with kingsley again by thestral c 
 
 hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsleys smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick 
 
 which leaves you and me ron said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him 
 
 ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione 
 
 an youre with me harry that all righ said hagrid looking a little anxious well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar 
 
 thats great said harry not altogether truthfully 
 
 we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters were betting theyll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door i make it three minutes until were supposed to leave no point locking the back door it wont keep the death eaters out when they come looking come on 
 
 harry hurried to gather his rucksack firebolt and hedwigs cage and followed the group to the dark back garden 
 
 on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on 
 
 is this it is this siriuss bike 
 
 the very same said hagrid beaming down at harry an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand 
 
 harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwigs cage between his knees he was extremely uncomfortable 
 
 arthurs done a bit o tinkerin said hagrid quite oblivious to harrys discomfort he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground its got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer 
 
 please be careful hagrid said mr weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies 
 
 all right then said moody everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost 
 
 everybody motioned their heads hold tight now ron said tonks and harry saw ron throw a forcing guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate 
 
 good luck everyone shouted moody see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three 
 
 there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwigs cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was 
 
 and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the middle of which the order members had risen oblivious c screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwigs cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees c 
 
 no c help 
 
 the broomstick spun too but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again a seconds relief and then another burst of green light the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage 
 
 no c no 
 
 the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle 
 
 hedwig c hedwig c 
 
 but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were c 
 
 hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwigs cage into the floor refusing to believe that she was dead hagrid turn around 
 
 my jobs ter get you there safe harry bellow hagrid and he opened the throttle stop c stop harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrids broad back hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them wriggling around he cried stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it 
 
 hold on harry thisll do for em roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge a wall a solid black wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up 
 
 more killing curses flew past harrys head from the two remaining death eaters wands they were aiming for hagrid harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening c 
 
 here we go again harry hold on yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button this time a great net burst from the bikes exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it 
 
 thisll do it harry hold on tight yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer 
 
 with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration 
 
 its all righ harry bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bikes slipstream 
 
 im on it harry don worry hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella 
 
 hagrid no let me 
 
 reparo 
 
 there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bikes flight then the sidecar began to lose height c 
 
 in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted wingardium leviosa 
 
 the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split seconds relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in 
 
 im comin harry hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled impedimenta 
 
 the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him c then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat c 
 
 im comin harry im comin 
 
 a huge hand seized the back of harrys robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbikes seat and found himself with hagrid as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled confringo 
 
 he knew a dreadful pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished 
 
 harry im sorry im sorry moaned hagrid i shouldnta tried ter repair it meself c yehve got no room c 
 
 its not a problem just keep flying harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer 
 
 as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the button again with harry seated so insecurely harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike c stan c 
 
 expelliarmus harry yelled 
 
 thats him its him its the real one 
 
 the hooded death eaters shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbikes engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view 
 
 harry whats happened bellowed hagrid whereve they gone 
 
 i dont know 
 
 but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted its the real one how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace where were they 
 
 he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrids jacket 
 
 hagrid do the thing again lets get out of here 
 
 hold on tight then harry 
 
 there was a deafening screeching roar again and the fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars c i think weve lost em harry i think weve done it yelled hagrid 
 
 but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand its him its the real one they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan 
 
 were nearly there harry weve nearly made it shouted hagrid 
 
 harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars 
 
 then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind c and then harry saw him voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again c 
 
 hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control c 
 
 green jets of light shot past them again harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm c 
 
 no 
 
 with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick c 
 
 barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream mine 
 
 it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard avada c 
 
 as the pain from harrys scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the button he punched it with his hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground 
 
 hagrid harry called holding on to the bike for dear life hagrid c accio hagrid 
 
 the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream your wand selwyn give me your wand 
 
 he felt voldemort before he saw him looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more c 
 
 and then voldemort vanished harry looked down and saw hagrid on the ground below him he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows
